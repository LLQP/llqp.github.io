<ul>
<li>Accident and Sickness (A&amp;S) insurance is defined as insurance that provides one or more of the following benefits to the life insured:<ul>
<li>Benefits for loss resulting from accidental bodily injury, including death, suffered by the life insured;</li>
<li>Benefits for loss resulting from sickness or disability;</li>
<li>Refund of expenses incurred due to sickness or accidental bodily injury suffered by the life insured;</li>
<li>Refund of expenses incurred due to medical treatment of the life insured.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In brief, A&amp;S insurance relieves insured individuals of the burdens of medical expenses or income loss arising from illness, injury or necessary medical treatment not covered by the provincial health insurance plans</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="11-for-individuals-and-their-families">1.1 For Individuals and Their Families<a class="headerlink" href="#11-for-individuals-and-their-families" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A&amp;S insurance protects an individual or a family from the burdens of medical expenses and income loss arising from:<ul>
<li>A health crisis due to physical injury;</li>
<li>An illness that prevents an individual from working;</li>
<li>Increased medical expenses from a health condition; and</li>
<li>The need to pay for long-term care.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="111-financial-goals-of-individuals-and-their-families">1.1.1 Financial goals of individuals and their families<a class="headerlink" href="#111-financial-goals-of-individuals-and-their-families" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The majority of families have similar principal financial objectives that require regular cash flow as well supplementary cash to be invested for the long term although the amounts and requirements will vary family to family.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1111-wealth-accumulation">1.1.1.1 Wealth accumulation<a class="headerlink" href="#1111-wealth-accumulation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Setting up an emergency fund, equivalent to three to six months’ current living expenses, is an important and immediate need that must be set up once primary needs (i.e., food, accommodation, clothing, means of travel, etc.) have been provided. It provides a financial cushion against unforeseen events.</li>
<li>After establishing an emergency fund, additional money not needed for living expenses can be saved for short and long-term goals. Such goals can include wealth accumulation, investing in a portfolio to provide current income or growth for retirement funds, and meeting family needs.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1112-retirement-income">1.1.1.2 Retirement income<a class="headerlink" href="#1112-retirement-income" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Retirement requires a source of income. Retirement income pays the costs of living as a retiree. All retirees have one thing in common—the requirement of income in one degree or another. It is often highly desirable to have more income available than simple needs require.</li>
<li>Retirement income comes from many sources such as:<ul>
<li>Government pension plans – Canada/Québec Pension Plans (CPP and QPP) and Old Age Security (OAS);</li>
<li>Employment pension plans;</li>
<li>Private pension plans – Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs);</li>
<li>Non-registered investments;</li>
<li>Inheritances;</li>
<li>Part-time employment or self-employment;</li>
<li>Liquidation of assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some of those sources do not require input from the individual (e.g., receiving an inheritance). The majority of retirement income sources result from saving and investing while working for many years prior to retirement - such as a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP).</li>
<li>If disability, sickness or economic downturns interrupt the ability to work, income may not be available to save for retirement needs and wants.</li>
<li>The agent plays a key role in assessing and determining which life insurance product best suits the needs of clients to ensure their financial protection. This is particularly important in the area of disability where products are needed to replace income during periods of disability.</li>

<ul>
<li>Families have many needs for income, both to pay the cost of basic living and the extras, such as holidays. For example, tuition for children’s education, orthodontics, vacations, etc., all must be provided for before retirement.</li>
<li>Wants and needs change over time; some, such as care for a disabled child demand special attention for a lifetime.</li>
<li>It is very important that families generate income and set aside savings to meet these continual family needs prior to retirement and prior to (or concurrent with) investing for wealth accumulation.</li>

<ul>
<li>In order to meet the financial objectives outlined in the previous section, the client must be able to generate enough income and savings over time.</li>
<li>There are many risks that could interrupt family financial goals, such as:<ul>
<li>Unexpected expenses;</li>

<ul>
<li>A budget should ideally help clients prepare for their future financial responsibilities in terms of their current income. Clients vary in their ability to make a realistic budget as well as stick to it.</li>
<li>Costs that would arise as a result of an accident or medical condition are not usually planned as part of a family budget.</li>
<li>Medical issues can create an unexpected expense or, if an issue is already being accommodated, can increase the cost of the expense. Both are detrimental to the budget and its objectives.</li>

<ul>
<li>When income is lost, savings may provide a stop-gap between what is being received and living expenses.</li>

<ul>
<li>A lower standard of living is a result of other risks resulting in personal financial loss (such as the loss of income, loss of assets, loss of savings, etc.).</li>
<li>The family’s diminishing financial circumstances could cause them to sell their cars, downgrade to a smaller home, eliminate family vacations, and so forth. This “domino effect” could be avoided if the client has A&amp;S insurance.</li>
<li>This lower standard of living could also affect the family psychologically, deterring them from future productivity, earning the same income again and restoring their standard of living.</li>

<h4 id="1125-inflation">1.1.2.5 Inflation<a class="headerlink" href="#1125-inflation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Inflation is a general increase in prices. The increase in prices results in the decline in the purchasing value of money.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a guide, for example, a “basket” of goods that cost $100 in 2000 cost $143.41 just 20 years later in 2020—an increase of 43%—during a period of historically low inflation. Looking at the long-term, $100 worth of goods bought in 1920 costs $1,173 one century later.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Inflation fluctuates. For example, using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Canada’s recent past, inflation has been reasonably low (1.95% in 2019) but further back in Canadian history it was much higher (12.12% in 1982).</li>
<li>An income that does not keep pace with inflation will have less purchasing power. In other words, salaries have to increase simultaneously with inflation for the worker to maintain his standard of living.</li>
<li>Individuals on fixed incomes, such as retirees, face this problem because their salaries do not increase with inflation.</li>
<li>An important tool for calculating inflation in Canada is the Inflation Calculator found on the Bank of Canada website: <a href="http://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/">http://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Life expectancy in Canada has greatly improved since the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. The life expectancy at birth for men has increased by 20.5 years, from 58.8 years in 1920-1922 to 79.3 years in 2009-2011. During the same period, the life expectancy of women increased by 23.0 years, from 60.6 years to 83.6 years.</li>
<li>In 1920-1922, Canadian men who had lived to age 65 could expect to live for 13 more years, and women could expect to live for 13.5 more years (to age 78.0 and 78.5 respectively).</li>
<li>In 2009-2011, 65-year-old men were expected to live until they were 83.8, while 65-year-old women were expected to live until the age of 86.7. This means that from 1920-1922 to 2009-2011, the life expectancies of 65-year-olds increased by 5.8 years for men and 8.2 years for women.</li>
<li>Since the age of retirement has remained virtually unchanged at age 65 for many years, this means people spend more years of their lives in retirement than previously.</li>
<li>There is a risk of outliving one’s money if the amount of retirement income needed is underestimated. In other words, the money runs out before the life ends.</li>
<li>Therefore, clients need to acquire more retirement assets to avoid outliving their money.</li>
<li>This need is heightened because seniors often incur more health care costs due to health problems or potentially needing extra care at home or in an institution (i.e., a nursing home).<ul>
<li>For example, it is increasingly rare for seniors who need medical assistance to live with their families. They usually go to live in a retirement home, nursing home or chronic care facility (depending on their needs). These facilities can be extremely expensive. They can drain the seniors’ savings and leave them in a position where they are dependent on the government or their children.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These factors underscore the importance of clients saving for retirement while they are able to earn an income.</li>
<li>These factors also demonstrate that retirees without enough savings to support their costs in retirement leave their children with little or no estate.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1127-debt">1.1.2.7 Debt<a class="headerlink" href="#1127-debt" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Debt reduces net worth. It refers to the value of a person’s assets minus his liabilities. Debt can destroy financial plans and objectives.</li>
<li>In 2017, total household debt in Canada rose to $1.4 trillion in mortgage debt and $630 billion in credit card debt.</li>
<li>Carrying costs—or interest—is the biggest concern when it comes to debt.</li>
<li>Credit card debt is especially worrisome due to the particularly high-interest rate that is charged on unpaid balances (18–24% or higher).</li>
<li>If income is interrupted and debt cannot be paid, an individual may face difficult decisions and severe and long-lasting repercussions. Repaying the debt with its extra interest charges may create a financial strain.</li>
<li>Debt servicing typically comes out of current income.</li>
<li>A client’s failure to take care of his debt could result in higher interest payments as well as—in extreme situations—in lawsuits, foreclosure and bankruptcy.</li>
<li>Therefore, it is very important to put in place insurance to replace the client’s own capacity to generate income or cover medical costs.</li>
<li>Many Canadians entering into retirement have substantial debt which can impede the long-term sustainability of their retirement plans.</li>

<li>Disability in Canada refers to when an individual has difficulty performing tasks due to a long-term condition or health-related problem and experiences a limitation in their day-to-day life.</li>
<li>The rate of disability increases with age.</li>
<li>According to the 2017 Canadian Survey on Disability by Statistics Canada:<ul>
<li>About 6.2 million Canadians over the age of 15 reported a disability;</li>
<li>More than 540,000 youths aged 15 to 24 years (13%) had one or more disabilities;</li>
<li>This compared with 20% or 3.7 million working age adults (aged 25 to 64) and 38% or 2 million seniors aged 65 and over had at least one disability;</li>
<li>Women (24%) have a higher prevvalance of disability than men (20%) and this was the case for all age groups; and</li>
<li>In 2017, 57% of Canadians with disabilities had a “less severe” disability (classified as having a mild or moderate disability) and 43% had a “more severe” disability (classified as having a severe or very severe disability). In all cases, the disability was severe enough to limit thier activities to some degree.</li>

<li>The coverage replaces the income of a sick or injured worker who is no longer able to work.</li>
<li>Regular income from working is replaced by income from insurance after a specified waiting period following the onset of disability. No benefits are payable during the waiting period.</li>

The policy has a 90-day (three-month) waiting period, a monthly benefit of $4,200 and a five-year benefit period.

<ul>
<li>As discussed, one of the primary financial goals of an individual is the accumulation of both short-term and long-term savings.</li>
<li>Unexpected occurrences can cause a decrease in both short-term and long-term savings.</li>
<li>Extended health insurance (another form of A&amp;S insurance) is insurance to protect savings from expenses caused by sickness or disability. This greatly reduces the financial impact of many of these risks by providing the insured individual with cash for medical costs and to replace income. For example, travel insurance is a form of extended health insurance that pays the costs of sickness for a Canadian travelling in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Mrs. Johnson, who runs a consulting sole proprietorship business, was injured in a slip and fall accident in January and was unable to work for 8 months. As a result, she was unable to earn her regular $5,000 a month of consulting fees for those months, resulting in a nearly 50% reduction in family income. The Johnsons’ son was hit in the mouth with a puck in a recreational hockey game and required over $10,000 of dental reconstructive surgery. And the Johnsons’ daughter developed a serious viral infection requiring 10 days of hospital treatment in a private room, at a cost of $125 a day over and above what the provincial health plan pays.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the family has extensive A&amp;S insurance coverage, both private and through Mr. Johnson’s group plan where he works. All of their daughter’s $1,250 of extra hospital expenses were covered under the group plan, as was $5,000 of their son’s dental expenses. And Mrs. Johnson has a disability income replacement plan that paid her $3,000 a month for five of the eight months that she was off work, a total of $15,000. Without adequate insurance coverage, the Johnsons’ savings would have been reduced by $21,250 ( $1,250 + $5,000 + $15,000).</p>

<ul>
<li>Long-term care insurance (another form of A&amp;S insurance) is insurance to protect assets. Therefore, estate value is not eroded because assets remain in place to ultimately pass on to heirs and beneficiaries.</li>
<li>Most Canadians save for their retirement, although the amount saved varies for each individual.</li>
<li>The general intent is that the savings not spent during retirement are passed down to their heirs.</li>
<li>However, health issues prevalent among seniors often drain retirement savings and estate assets, leaving a depleted legacy to pass onto heirs.</li>
<li>Long-term care and critical illness insurance both protect this from happening by maintaining the value of the estate through providing benefits to offset much of these costs.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Eudora, age 69, never earned a large salary and had no pension plan at her place of business. However, she did manage to accumulate about $250,000 in RRSPs and non-registered investments, in addition to her $150,000 home. To date, she has been able to manage on her $1,250 a month ( $15,000 a year) in government benefits and some interest and dividends from her investments.</p>
<p>Eudora just discovered that she has a degenerative disease that will force her to move into a nursing home, at a cost of $2,750 a month ( $33,000 a year). Despite her health problems, Eudora has a normal life expectancy of age 85 (16 more years). The shortfall in her income versus the cost of the nursing home would require Eudora to liquidate $18,000 a year of her assets ( $33,000 – $15,000), reducing her estate by about $290,000 over her lifetime ( $18,000 × 16 years): money she had planned to leave to her three grandnieces.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Eudora took out a long-term care policy when she was in her mid-50s. The policy will cover $1,000 of her monthly expenses ( $12,000 annually), reducing the erosion of her estate to less than $100,000 over her lifetime (( $18,000 – $12,000) × 16 years = $96,000), and enabling her to still leave a substantial legacy for her family.</p>

<li>Business profitability (income protection);</li>
<li>Business succession (capital protection);</li>
<li>Sale at fair market value (protection of estate value).</li>

<li>Once the business takes off, profitability and growth become the principal goals of a business. Profitability is key for a business to succeed long-term.</li>
<li>Continuity is central to business profitability.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1212-business-succession">1.2.1.2 Business succession<a class="headerlink" href="#1212-business-succession" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Business succession refers to the passing on of a business to a successor (family member, employee, etc.).</li>
<li>Many business owners hope to pass their business down to their children. This is often not possible due to poor planning even if the children are willing to take over the business. In cases where the children are willing to take over, a lack of proper preparation can result in the business failing before any transition can be affected.</li>
<li>A disability or illness of the business owner could ruin his plans to pass the business along through succession; there could be nothing left to pass if he has not been able to work and keep up the revenue stream and operations. Business overhead insurance—an A&amp;S product—is a possible solution for this need. See more in Chapter 5.</li>

<ul>
<li>Often the children cannot or do not want to take over a business.</li>
<li>In these circumstances, the best-case scenario is to plan in advance and sell the business at its fair market value.</li>
<li>A fire sale refers to when the sale of a business is sudden and unplanned. In this case, competitors or possible successors seek to benefit from the situation by buying the business for much less than what it is actually worth.</li>
<li>Ideally, business owners should plan in advance and find a suitable buyer to purchase their business. They make a deal with the buyer to buy their business at a fair market value using the appropriate legal tool (i.e., a buy-sell agreement). This ensures that the buyer has enough funds when it comes time to buy the business.</li>
<li>Life insurance addresses the need to sell a business at fair market value if the business owner or partner dies.</li>
<li>Disability income insurance addresses the need to sell a business at fair market value if the business owner or partner is disabled.</li>
<li>Chapter 5 of this manual looks at how accident and sickness insurance helps to secure the needed funding and accurate legal documentation to ensure that a disabled business owner can acquire the business at a fair price.</li>

<li>Systematic—common to the business environment; or</li>
<li>Unsystematic—unique to the client’s specific business itself (i.e., business risk), rather than to the market or the economy as a whole.</li>

<li>The costs of business could include payroll, rent, inventory, etc.</li>
<li>An individual has three options to self-fund the cost of a loss associated with a risk:<ul>
<li>Pay the cost out of current cash flow;</li>
<li>Borrow to obtain funds to pay the cost;</li>
<li>Use savings or sell assets.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A business owner’s best option is to insure against the possible loss incurred by risks, such as death, disability or medical expenses caused by injury or illness.</li>
<li>Insurance is based on the transfer of the financial impact of a risk, from a potential insured to the insurance company.</li>
<li>A&amp;S insurance transfers the risk of loss of income or medical expenses to the insurance company.</li>
<li>A modest premium paid to the insurance company will assure that the necessary funds are in place to replace income lost or expenses incurred due to disability or illness.</li>
<li>The insured person will lose their premium if they do not need to file a claim but the amount paid to the insurer will most typically be less than the amount that would be incurred if the insurance was not purchased.</li>
