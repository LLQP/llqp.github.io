<ul>
<li>Disability income (DI) insurance replaces income due to the inability to work.</li>
<li>Many types of DI insurance coverage are available.</li>
<li>Anyone who is insurable from a medical perspective and earns an income may acquire DI insurance coverage from the following sources:<ul>
<li>An individual disability income insurance policy obtained directly from the insurance provider;</li>
<li>A group insurance coverage, as an employee or member of a union/association (that offers group insurance coverage);</li>
<li>Creditor insurance provided by a lender to its borrowers;</li>
<li>Provincial Workers’ Compensation Boards; and</li>
<li>Disability pensions through CPP and QPP.</li>

<ul>
<li>An individual disability insurance contract is structured with:<ul>
<li>A policyholder, who is also called the insured, refers to the individual who pays the premium and collects the policy benefits;</li>
<li>A life insured refers to the individual whose disability initiates the disability benefits;</li>
<li>The life insured is often the same person as the policyholder;</li>
<li>The life insured is the person who receives the benefit of the policy—for instance, the monthly disability income benefit and may be called the policy beneficiary;</li>
<li>The life insurance company provides the policy benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore, individual DI contracts are entered into between the applicant (who is often both the policyholder and the life insured) and the insurance company.</li>
<li>Generally, the policyholder is the premium payor, the life insured and the beneficiary under the policy.</li>
<li>DI policies are purchased by:<ul>
<li>Individuals to replace income in the event of a disability;</li>
<li>Business owners to replace financial loss incurred in the event of the disability of a key employee or employer. Insurance for business use is examined in Chapter 5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Premiums paid are not tax-deductible and benefits received are not taxable under individually owned DI policies.</li>

<ul>
<li>The mortgage DI market is a specialized subsection of creditor insurance.</li>
<li>An individual who has a mortgage can acquire disability insurance that will make monthly mortgage payments if he becomes disabled.</li>
<li>Mortgage insurance can be provided through the financial institution that has provided the mortgage or through a personal policy.</li>
<li>Insurance provided by the lending institution:<ul>
<li>Is issued as a group policy;</li>
<li>Is the less expensive option;</li>
<li>Has various restrictions and limitations—underwriting is limited and less stringent;</li>
<li>The borrower is the mortgagor and the financial institution is both the mortgagee and beneficiary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Insurance in the form of an individual income replacement policy:<ul>
<li>Is more flexible in how the policyholder can use benefits;</li>
<li>Is the more expensive option—premiums tend to be higher than mortgage insurance arranged through the lending institution;</li>
<li>Provided after full underwriting;</li>
<li>The life insured is the beneficiary of the DI policy;</li>
<li>The borrower has the intent to use a portion of the claims to cover the monthly mortgage payments.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>There are various types of individual DI policies, each defined by the benefits it offers, the factors used to calculate premiums and the riders that may be added to it in order to customize the coverage offered.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="221-types-of-individual-policies">2.2.1 Types of individual policies<a class="headerlink" href="#221-types-of-individual-policies" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Many types of individual DI policies exist.</li>
<li>Each policy is defined by its benefits, premiums and riders.</li>
<li>Personally owned DI policies can be differentiated in the contract by the number of guarantees provided to the policyholder:<ul>
<li>An absolute guarantee (policy can never be altered/cancelled);</li>
<li>An increasing premium;</li>
<li>Contracts that can be terminated by the insurer at any time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The following most common types of DI policies are discussed in the following section:<ul>
<li>Non-cancellable policies;</li>
<li>Guaranteed renewable policies;</li>
<li>Cancellable policies;</li>
<li>Guaranteed issue policies;</li>
<li>Non-traditional disability insurance plans.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2211-non-cancellable-policy">2.2.1.1 Non-cancellable policy<a class="headerlink" href="#2211-non-cancellable-policy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Referred to as a non-cancellable (non-can) and guaranteed renewable contracts.</li>
<li>A non-cancellable policy offers the most guarantees to its policyholder:<ul>
<li>The life insurance company cannot cancel the policy;</li>
<li>Policy premiums cannot increase;</li>
<li>Policy benefits cannot be reduced or changed;</li>
<li>Carries the highest premium;</li>
<li>The insurer renews the policy annually, until the life insured turns 65;</li>
<li>The policyholder is the sole individual who can modify the policy, subject to underwriting if applicable, before its maturity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Typically, at age 65, the policyholder has an option to convert the policy, without proof of insurability, to a guaranteed renewable contract with a shortened benefit period generally ranging from a year or two.</li>
<li>Premiums are based on the insured’s age when the policy is converted.</li>
<li>The guaranteed renewable policy typically ends when the life insured is 72 or 75. Because the benefit period is shortened to 12 or 24 months, the premiums remain reasonable even though the insured is over age 65.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2212-guaranteed-renewable-policy">2.2.1.2 Guaranteed renewable policy<a class="headerlink" href="#2212-guaranteed-renewable-policy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>With guaranteed renewable policies the life insurance company is bound to renew the policy every year until the policy matures—typically at age 65.</li>
<li>But the insurer has a right to change the premiums unilaterally.</li>
<li>The premium cannot be changed for an individual insured. Any change must apply to the entire class of policies that impact all lives insured under the class type.</li>
<li>The policyholders have to be notified of any changes in the contract at least 30 days before a change or cancellation takes effect.</li>
<li>All changes are put in place at the annual policy renewable time.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2213-cancellable-policy">2.2.1.3 Cancellable policy<a class="headerlink" href="#2213-cancellable-policy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A cancellable policy is also issued on a class basis meaning that all policy changes must apply to all of the policyholders—the policy of a sole individual cannot be altered.</li>
<li>It offers the fewest guarantees to the policyholder and carries the lowest premiums.</li>
<li>The life insurance company can cancel the policy, reduce or change benefits, and increase premiums at any time without the policyholder’s consent.</li>
<li>The policyholders have to be notified of any changes in the contract at least 30 days before a change/modification takes effect.</li>
<li>A cancellable policy is issued to higher-risk occupations (i.e., labourers, taxi drivers, etc.).</li>
<li>Because of the lack of long-term certainty for the policyholder, all other factors being equal, premiums for cancellable contracts will be lower than those for guaranteed renewable policies, which, in turn, have lower premiums than non-cancellable and guaranteed renewable policies.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Jean-Marc is insured under a non-cancellable guaranteed renewable disability insurance policy. Four years ago, Jean-Marc developed severe depression, for which he is still undergoing treatment.

<ul>
<li>The guaranteed issue policy is an individually issued policy only offered by a few insurers.</li>
<li>It is an alternative to traditional long-term disability (LTD) group insurance.</li>
<li>A guaranteed issue policy guarantees the coverage of the insured and is issued to individuals who are members of low-risk groups, such as lawyers, doctors, etc.</li>
<li>The premium is higher than an equivalent group plan.</li>
<li>The insurer can cancel the guaranteed aspect of the plan at any time by refusing to accept any further lives insured on a guaranteed basis.</li>
<li>At the time of the application, applicants must be actively at work and not on a disability claim.</li>
<li>Due to the plan’s guaranteed nature, the guaranteed issue policies may incur certain restrictions based on the:<ul>
<li>Size of the group;</li>
<li>Occupational category of the group members;</li>
<li>Minimum annual premium commitment;</li>
<li>Minimum average age for the group members.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are two forms of guaranteed issue plans.</li>
<li>Guaranteed standard risk:<ul>
<li>Coverage is guaranteed to be issued without coverage restrictions or premium ratings;</li>
<li>Often there will be extra restrictions based on the plan’s administration such as every member of the group may be required to participate or that 100% of the premiums must be fully paid by the employer;</li>
<li>The reason every member has to participate is to avoid anti-selection which refers to when an imbalance occurs in the risk levels presented by employees. A potential unbalance could occur if only higher-risk employees subscribed for the plan and lower-risk members opted out of the insurance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guaranteed-to-issue:<ul>
<li>Coverage is based on medical underwriting. These plans guarantee to issue some form of coverage though not exactly the coverage applied for;</li>
<li>Non-standard risks (that is people who pose a higher degree of risk than standard risk) may pay a higher premium, called a rated premium or issue an exclusion rider;</li>
<li>If an individual poses a higher risk due to a particular hobby or activity, coverage may exclude a claim that arises from that hobby or activity. For example, if a person participates in scuba diving and becomes ill as a result of scuba diving, his claim may be denied.</li>

<ul>
<li>Insurance companies are responding to changes in the Canadian workforce by introducing new policies and easing up on restrictions.</li>
<li>In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, there has been a significant growth of self-employed workers in Canada. By 2019, 15.2% of Canadian workers were self-employed contract workers.</li>
<li>These changes have had a significant impact on disability insurance and the main market of employees for which it has traditionally provided DI insurance.</li>
<li>Insurance products must align themselves with the changing work market.</li>
<li>Employers typically do not provide benefits for contract workers.</li>
<li>Contract workers often seek out standard disability coverage but find that sickness coverage is not practical because it is too expensive/requires too long a waiting period to be beneficial.</li>
<li>Contract workers prefer an affordable accident and sickness policy that would initiate immediately upon accident or illness (i.e., first-day benefits).</li>
<li>Many insurers have made the accident and sickness elements of their DI policies distinct and separate. This policy insures against the loss of income due to either accident or sickness (but not both).</li>
<li>Other insurers are changing the definition of disability to better suit the changing market:<ul>
<li>For example, changing the definition of total disability to the inability to perform specified functions instead of job duties. This new definition includes the work of the self-employed contract worker because workers who are not employees offer skills to a workplace instead of services and duties outlined in an employee contract;</li>
<li>For example, offering an income-based definition of disability which bases disability on the inability to earn a specified percentage of regular income due to disability. This definition also acknowledges that job services often differ between contracts;</li>
<li>For example, changing the definition of disability to the inability to find new contracts due to disability, thus offering disability benefits to unemployed self-employed contract workers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some plans offer special benefits to an insured who may not have gainful employment such as an individual who provides full-time care to their children or who perform volunteer service. These policies provide the insured with limited monthly benefits to “contract out” the services the insured was providing in the past such as babysitting, volunteering, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="222-individual-policy-benefits">2.2.2 individual Policy benefits<a class="headerlink" href="#222-individual-policy-benefits" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Individual disability insurance is more involved than simply providing monthly income benefits to insured members who meet the policy’s definition of disabled.</li>
<li>Disability insurance (DI) policies differ in terms of benefits such as:<ul>
<li>The amount of benefits paid;</li>
<li>When benefits commence;</li>
<li>The duration that benefits are payable (if they are payable at all depending on the circumstances).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2221-amount-of-benefit">2.2.2.1 Amount of benefit<a class="headerlink" href="#2221-amount-of-benefit" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>One of the risks faced by disability insurers is that an insured will act differently due to the disability insurance being in place by claiming to be disabled or still disabled. In such cases, DI insurance potentially gives an individual the opportunity of earning an income without the need to actually work.</li>
<li>Disability benefits from individually owned DI policies are tax-free;</li>
<li>The maximum benefit of a DI policy is typically no more than 60% of pre-tax active income (that is income earned from performing actual work). It is not 100% of income because the disability benefit takes into account income tax and other benefits normally applicable to business income;</li>
<li>This is easy to calculate when an individual solely earns a salary/self-employment income.</li>
<li>Therefore, the formula for the disability benefit based on active income is:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a>Pre-tax income × percentage of DI coverage = disability benefit based on earned income

<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 1</p>
<p>John earns $100,000 per year. His income of $100,000 is taxed at about 40%; his take-home pay is $60,000. His disability benefit would pay $60,000 and he would not pay tax on the $60,000.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 2</p>
<p>Heinrich is a sole proprietor, working as a consulting computer technician. Most years, he earns $70,000 in consulting fees and has about $12,000 in business expenses which are only incurred if he is working. After allowing for income taxes annually, he gets to keep roughly $38,000 of the $70,000 that he earns.</p>
<p>Based on his pre-tax income of $70,000, less $12,000 of deductible business expenses, an insurance company would offer him maximum DI coverage of about <span class="arithmatex">\(34,800 ([\)</span>70,000 - $12,000] × 60%). This is close to the $38,000 that he gets to keep, after-tax, while he is working. He is financially neither advantaged nor disadvantaged if he is on a disability claim, minimizing the chances that he would submit a false claim or artificially prolong a valid claim in order to continue receiving an income without working.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>It is more difficult to calculate the disability benefit if the insured has sources of passive income (income not earned by performing work) on top of his earned income that continues during a period of disability. Passive income can include earned or passive income of a spouse or family member, investment income, or cash flow that will continue if the insured is disabled.</li>
<li>Insurers treat the continual, passive income as part of the disability benefit and reduce the disability coverage accordingly. If the insured were to receive the disability benefit in addition to their passive income, they will have little incentive to go back to work. The reduced disability benefit avoids such situations.</li>
<li>In this case, the total income will be reduced by the passive income and the percentage of DI coverage (maximum of 60%) will be based on the final sum.</li>
<li>Therefore, the formula to calculate the disability benefit, taking into account passive income that continues during a period of disability is:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-1-1" name="__codelineno-1-1" href="#__codelineno-1-1"></a>(Earned income + non-earned income) × percentage of DI coverage – non earned income 
<a id="__codelineno-1-2" name="__codelineno-1-2" href="#__codelineno-1-2"></a>= disability benefit based on earned and non-earned income
</code></pre></div>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 2 (Cont.)</p>
<p>Consider the case of Heinrich, above. Assume that, in addition to his earned income of $70,000 a year, he has income from a family trust of $20,000 a year, income that will be paid to him whether he is working or not. If the insurance company were to ignore the trust income and issue him $34,800 (or 60% of ( <span class="arithmatex">\(70,000―\)</span>12,000)) of disability protection, during a period of disability, he would receive $34,800 a year from the insurance company and $20,000 from the trust—or $54,800 a year of total income—almost 78% of his gross, pre-disability earned income as a consulting computer technician. There would be little incentive for Heinrich to return to work.</p>
<p>Even if the insurance company were to include the $20,000 of trust income in Heinrich’s computation of “earned income”, he would end up being over-insured; 60% of Heinrich’s total income of $70,000 ( $58,000 net in fees plus $20,000 from the trust) equals $46,800 a year in disability benefits. However, Heinrich would still be receiving the full $20,000 from the trust, making his total income $66,800 while on the disability claim. This would represent about 86% of Heinrich’s pre-disability income, well in excess of the 60% threshold that would place him in a neutral position.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 2 (Cont.)</p>
<p>In this case, the insurer would be willing to insure a benefit equal to 60% of Heinrich’s total pre-disability income of $78,000, or $46,800. However, the coverage offered would then be reduced by the $20,000 of trust income that he would still be receiving while disabled, leaving a DI benefit of $26,800. The combination of the disability benefit and the trust income would then total $46,800, or 60% of Heinrich’s total pre-disability income of $78,000.</p>

<li>The waiting period can be as short as zero days, or as long as 12 months. 90 days is the norm. The longer the waiting period, the lower the premium.</li>
<li>The least risky occupational classes receive the shortest waiting periods.</li>
<li>All factors being equal, policies with a shorter waiting periods charge higher insurance premiums.</li>
<li>Benefits are not paid during the waiting period.</li>
<li>The waiting period is in place to avoid paying for disabilities of a very short-term nature.</li>

<li>The most common benefit periods of long-term disability are 2, 5, 10-years, and to age 65. However, some insurers coverage up to age 75 on an accident-only basis.</li>

<li>If an insured makes a false statement or a material misrepresentation, meaning he misrepresented or forgot a fact that would have affected the underwriting of the policy and this is discovered within two years of the policy issue date, the policy can be made void (i.e., declared legally invalid) by the insurance company.</li>
<li>The two-year period is called the contestability period because after two years, the policy becomes incontestable.</li>
<li>The contract is potentially voided based on the notion that if all the information and facts were initially accurately presented to the insurance company, the policy might never have been put in force in the first place.</li>
<li>For example, failure to disclose a previous back injury that could have impacted the underwriting decision is a misstatement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fraud:<ul>
<li>Fraud is when the insured attempts to, or is successful at, deceiving the insurance company in order to receive a policy or pay a lower premium.</li>
<li>If the misrepresentation was made by mistake (i.e., the applicant forgot about a health factor and honestly assumed it was not important to disclose), then no fraud is presumed to have taken place.</li>
<li>Fraud always voids a policy regardless of when it is discovered.</li>
<li>A false claim refers to when an insured commits fraud at the time of a claim. If the insured makes a false claim, the insurer holds the right to call the entire policy and deny the claim.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Absence of loss:<ul>
<li>Benefits are only payable under a disability claim if the claim is both proven to be valid and there is evidence of income loss due to disability.</li>
<li>The life insured must show income to substantiate his claim. If his income when he makes a claim was lower than the amount he was insured for, the claim will be adjusted to reflect the actual (lower) income;=.</li>

<li>Recurring disability occurs when a life insured returns to work after an absence due to disability only to have the disability, attributed to the same cause, reoccur. The life insured then stops working due to his disability and goes back on disability leave.</li>
<li>In this case, the disabled worker could potentially be subject to two lengthy waiting periods without any payable benefits in a short period of time—a waiting period for the first disability instance and another waiting period when the disability reoccurs.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Ophelia injured her back in January of 2014, in a fall on ice in the parking lot of the office where she works. She was off work for five months, collecting disability benefits for two of those months after allowing for the 90-day waiting period under her DI coverage. Two months after returning to work she was forced to take time off again, another four months in this instance, as sitting at her computer chair all day long aggravated her previous back injury. If she was required to undergo another 90-day waiting period for the second instance of disability, she would have received only three months of benefits during a period when she was disabled for nine months out of eleven.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The recurrent disability clause in many DI contracts is designed to prevent the insured from having to undergo another waiting period when a disability reoccurs. For most policies, if the second instance of disability, resulting from the same clause, occurs within six months after returning to work, the situation is treated as one instance of disability and the second waiting period will not apply.</li>
<li>The disability must be a recurrence of the original health condition; it cannot be a new condition.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example  (Cont.)</p>
<p>In Ophelia’s case, above, if her policy contained a recurring disability clause, she would not be subject to a second waiting period and her benefits would recommence immediately upon the onset of the second instance of disability, incurred after only two months back on the job. As such, she would receive six months’ worth of benefits during the eleven-month period, not merely three.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The disadvantage to a recurring disability clause is that the two or more periods of recurring disability can be treated as one benefit period without any interruption.</li>
<li>Therefore, the disability benefit is calculated from the beginning of the first benefit period.</li>
<li>If the benefit period is shorter (i.e., two to five years), this could greatly affect the total amount of benefits received due to a disability that lasts for an extended period of time.</li>
<li>This also means that benefits could potentially run out before the end of the second disability period.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Ryan hurts his back in a skiing accident. His disability policy has:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 24-month benefit period;</li>
<li>A 90-day waiting period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ryan is approved for his disability claim and after 90 days receives his first benefit. Six months later Ryan returns to work, and after two months finds he is unable to work due to back pain from the accident. He begins to receive his policy benefit again. It begins immediately; there is no waiting period.</p>
<p>He has 18 months remaining in benefits (i.e., the 24-month policy benefit minus 6 months’ benefit received), not 24, because of the benefits received under the first claim were deducted from his remaining benefit period.</p>

<ul>
<li>A presumptive disability refers to when the insured suffers from a specified type of disability or the injury is so severe that the individual is presumed to be disabled. In such cases, the waiting period is waived and benefits are paid for the full benefit period, even if the life insured is able to resume work at his previous income level.</li>
<li>Presumptive disabilities include:<ul>
<li>Total and Irreversible loss of hearing;</li>
<li>Total and Irreversible loss of sight;</li>
<li>Loss of limbs, or loss of the use of limbs, including both arms, both legs, and an arm and leg; and</li>
<li>Total and permanent loss of speech.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The benefits start immediately even if the insured can return to work and fulfill all of his previous duties as well as receive his full salary right away.</li>
<li>Therefore, loss of income does not have to be proven to receive the disability benefit (as is the case with most disability benefits). In order to receive the disability benefit the insured must prove that the qualifying disability exists.</li>
<li>The presumptive disability benefit is available in the majority of (but not necessarily all) policies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2229-survivor-benefit">2.2.2.9 Survivor benefit<a class="headerlink" href="#2229-survivor-benefit" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Some disability policies include a survivor benefit clause that if the life insured dies while receiving a disability benefit, a lump-sum survivor benefit may be paid to his estate.</li>
<li>A qualification period is sometimes required by the policy, such that the survivor benefit is only payable if the insured had been disabled for a minimum period prior to his death (for example, 12 months).</li>
<li>Upon proof of death, the sum is paid in a lump sum and is usually three times the monthly benefit.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>ABC insurance pays David $3,000 a month for his disability benefit while he is unable to work due to injury. David suddenly dies in the middle of his disability claim. ABC insurance pays three times the total monthly disability benefit to his estate. Therefore, David’s estate receives $9,000 ( $3,000 x 3).</p>

<ul>
<li>Aside from the monthly benefit requested, a variety of factors impact the premium charged for a disability income replacement policy such as the following:<ul>
<li>The insured’s age;</li>
<li>The insured’s gender;</li>
<li>The insured’s health;</li>
<li>Smoker/non-smoker status;</li>
<li>Occupation;</li>
<li>Definition of disability used;</li>
<li>Claims history of the insured;</li>
<li>The length of waiting and benefit periods for the policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each of these factors will be discussed in the subsequent section.</li>
<li>Other factors not listed and not specific to the insured that also affect the premium rate are:<ul>
<li>An estimate of investment returns on accumulated premiums and expenses related to operating;</li>
<li>Morbidity tables in terms of assessing and evaluating the likely cost of taking on risk. Morbidity refers to the actuarial estimate of the risk of disability within segments of the population, broken down by age, gender, occupation, etc. These other factors will be examined later on in the study notes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2231-impact-of-gender-and-age">2.2.3.1 Impact of gender and age<a class="headerlink" href="#2231-impact-of-gender-and-age" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The life insured’s age and gender are two of the most significant factors in setting policy premiums in a DI policy.</li>
<li>In terms of gender, women experience a higher number of claims and length of disability than men.</li>
<li>In terms of age, younger people have a higher risk of disability than those who are older. But the length of time they are disabled is shorter than for older people.</li>
<li>Therefore:<ul>
<li>It is likely that men will pay lower DI premium than women of the same age group for the same coverage;</li>
<li>Younger applicants will likely pay lower DI premium than older applicants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Table 2.2 demonstrates the risk of becoming completely disabled before age 65 for more than 90 days and the average duration of the disability.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="picture 74" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dekingtt/statics/images/2022-01-07-01-907.png" />  </p>
<ul>
<li>It may be noted from above that the probability of disability is greater among those who are 25 years old than for those who have already reached 45, though the average duration of disability is longer for those who have reached 45 years of age.</li>
<li>Insurance carriers create similar morbidity tables based on their claims history with their target markets.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2232-health-issues">2.2.3.2 Health issues<a class="headerlink" href="#2232-health-issues" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The overall health of the life insured, in the past, present and future has a direct bearing on premiums and the underwriting process.</li>
<li>Family issues will also be a concern when there is a genetic link to the life insured.<ul>
<li>For example, when health conditions are likely to run in the family such as having more than one family member with breast cancer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Premiums and benefits are classified as:<ul>
<li>Standard Life - reflecting the same degree of risk as the average individual;</li>
<li>Rated - reflecting a higher degree of risk than the average individual;</li>
<li>Uninsurable - reflecting an unacceptable degree of risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If an applicant has health issues, an exclusion of coverage for specified causes of disability may be offered.</li>
<li>The applicant will receive the same standard premium and benefits if he lives an average life and thus likely faces the same risks of disability as the average individual.</li>
<li>The applicant will be denied insurance or will be subject to higher premiums, which do not include coverage for particular causes of disability, if the applicant has a history of health complications (or is still injured/ill).<ul>
<li>If an applicant files a disability claim within one year of the application, the condition that led to that claim may be classified as a “pre-existing condition.” Insurers often state in DI policies that, under a one-year exclusion rider, any pre-existing conditions may be excluded from the coverage for the year following the issue of the policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many sources of information are used to compile the medical “picture” of the applicant, including a(n):<ul>
<li>Attending physician’s statements (APS) from the applicant’s doctor;</li>
<li>Non-medical form on the application;</li>
<li>Paramedical exam from a nurse, if required;</li>
<li>Full doctor’s medical exam, if required;</li>
<li>Blood, saliva and urine samples;</li>
<li>Data from the Medical Information Bureau (MIB);</li>
<li>Inspection report from an investigator for lifestyle issues.</li>

<h4 id="2233-definitions-of-disability">2.2.3.3 Definitions of disability<a class="headerlink" href="#2233-definitions-of-disability" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The definition of when an insured is “disabled” for puposes of disability insurance is not just a single one. A disability may be “partial” or “total” and, within that range, four distinct definitions are used in different policies.</li>
<li>Different definitions of disability are used by different policies.</li>
<li>Typically, the disability’s cause is not considered in the definition. Workers’ Compensation coverage which deals solely with work-related injuries and illnesses is the exception and takes into account the disability’s cause.</li>
<li>The four main definitions of disability used in DI are:<ul>
<li>Own occupation;</li>
<li>Regular occupation;</li>
<li>Any occupation; and</li>
<li>Total disability (according to the CPP).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Partial disability will be defined and examined later in this chapter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Own Occupation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The own occupation definition of disability is the most liberal in that it is the easiest under which to qualify as being disabled—the insured is seen as completely disabled if he cannot carry out his main work tasks, even part time.</li>
<li>The insured never has to return to work post-disability if he cannot perform the primary duties of his regular occupation—he returns to work once he can perform all the main duties of his regular occupation.</li>
<li>Furthermore, he can take another job in another occupation and continue to receive his disability benefit.</li>
<li>This type of policy is only available to the highest classification of occupants – those who are least likely to make a claim, such as doctors, lawyers, dentists, etc.</li>
<li>“Own occupation” carries the highest premium due to:<ul>
<li>The generous benefits provided to the life insured; and the larger policy purchased by high-income professionals who qualify for a cheaper rate/$100. These individuals are the least likely to need to file claims and tend not to stay on claim as long as other occupation classes, who earn less and, therefore, have to purchase smaller policy coverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Tobias worked as a surgeon, earning $240,000 a year. Four years ago, he was injured in his home workshop and lost all the dexterity in his right hand. As a consequence, he can no longer function as a surgeon. After rehabilitation, Tobias took up a position at the local medical school, teaching other surgeons the techniques that he had developed. He also travels on the lecture circuit and has published two books since his accident. In total, he now earns $300,000 a year from his various enterprises but, since he can no longer function as a surgeon, he continues to receive benefits under his DI policy, which has an “own occupation” definition of disability.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Regular Occupation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The regular occupation definition uses the same definition and has the same implications as own occupation except if the life insured takes another job, the disability benefit may be reduced or ended.</li>
<li>The decision about returning to work is made only by the life insured—even if he is physically able.</li>
<li>Also available to those who are least likely to make a claim.</li>
<li>Has a lower premium than own occupation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Any Occupation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The any occupation definition of disability is applicable when the insured is seen as disabled if he is ill/injured and thus cannot carry out some or all of the functions associated with his regular occupation and he is not able to carry out the functions of any other occupation that would be suitable for him based on his education or experience.</li>
<li>This is the most stringent definition of disability since there are so many potential occupations for which the insured might still be capable of performing (and the insured’s ability to perform the duties of any suitable occupation disqualifies him from being classified as “disabled”).</li>
<li>This type of policy is available to the greatest number of individuals, including those in higher-risk occupational classes.</li>
<li>It is expected that the life insured who cannot work in his regular occupation will become employed in another job as a suitable alternative to his regular occupation or benefits may cease.</li>
<li>This type of DI policy has the lowest DI premium.</li>
<li>Total Disability according to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP)</li>
<li>Total disability is the definition used by the Canada Pension Plan.</li>
<li>The definition applies when the insured is totally unable to work at any job that he is suited for by his education and experience. It entails that the insured will likely never recover and be able to return to employment (i.e., severe and prolonged) and may likely die from the cause of the medical condition.</li>
<li>This definition is rarely used by conventional group or individual DI policies. However, it is used more often in creditor insurance coverage.</li>
<li>Exception – In Québec, the Québec Pension Plan (QPP) defines total disability in slightly different terms: the disability must be seen as serious (inability to hold any employment on a full-time basis) as well as permanent (last indefinitely, without any chance of getting better).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2234-occupational-clause">2.2.3.4 Occupational clause<a class="headerlink" href="#2234-occupational-clause" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Some occupations are riskier than others and those who work in them are more likely to make claims.</li>
<li>In underwriting disability insurance, the applicant’s occupation is taken into consideration in terms of:<ul>
<li>The applicant’s insurability;</li>
<li>The policy type available;</li>
<li>The riders and benefits available;</li>
<li>The cost (premium level) for the coverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Higher-risk occupations may not be offered policy types or benefits offered to those in lower-risk occupations.</li>
<li>Life insurance companies categorize occupations by the risk of claims being made. These are called occupational classes. The following are the most common forms of classification:<ul>
<li>4A – Professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, dentists and senior executives;</li>
<li>3A – Administrative office workers who face few, if any, workplace hazards, such as clerical staff;</li>
<li>2A – Supervisors in low-risk environments, salespersons and like occupations;</li>
<li>A – Skilled manual workers who face few or no workplace hazards, or those working, for instance, as courier truck drivers;</li>
<li>B – Manual labourers who work in hazardous environments, such as home construction workers.</li>
<li>A lower premium would be available to the 4A occupation than the 3A occupation for the same coverage, lower premium for 3A vs. 2A, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certain policy types/benefits would not be available to those in higher-risk classifications. For example, an applicant in the A class would not be able to likely get an own occupation coverage.</li>
<li>Most DI contracts have an occupational clause that if a life insured changes to a riskier occupation, he may find his premiums increase or his benefits are reduced.</li>
<li>The reverse is also true: if a new job has less risk than the old, the life insured can ask for a higher classification.</li>
<li>At the underwriting stage, those in higher-risk categories may qualify for better consideration if they meet requirements for job and income stability.</li>
<li>Even though the insured continues in a higher-risk occupation, an upgrade would equate to a lower premium. A medical underwriting would be necessary to confirm that the insured has not developed into a higher risk for reasons other than his occupation.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Eunice took out a disability income replacement policy when she worked as an administrator in the office of a printing factory, a 3A classification. She paid $225 a month. Five years later, Eunice changed jobs with the same employer and is now working as a staff supervisor on the floor of the printing plant, an A classification job. Her policy was guaranteed renewable, so she was able to keep her coverage but her premium increased to $350 a month and her waiting period was extended from 60 to 90 days.</p>

<h4 id="2235-waiver-of-premium">2.2.3.5 Waiver of premium<a class="headerlink" href="#2235-waiver-of-premium" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A waiver of premium refers to an intrinsic provision of the DI contract in which premium payment is waived (i.e., no premiums need to be paid by the insured) during the time the life insured under the policy is on a disability claim. Note that the waiver of premium is not a rider (as it is with life insurance policies).</li>
<li>The premium for a disability income policy is waived (that is, not applied):<ul>
<li>When the life insured is receiving the disability benefit or;</li>
<li>To the end of the benefit period/to when the life insured reaches 65 years (whichever comes first).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The terms of the contract determine if the waiver of premium applies to the disability. Some policies only apply a waiver of premium involving total disability and sometimes partial disability.</li>
<li>How does it work?<ul>
<li>Generally, the policyholder continues to pay the premium for the disability income policy for 90 days after he is totally disabled. After this period, the waiver commences. Many policies will refund the premium paid during the 90-day waiting period.</li>
<li>The policyholder then makes no further premium payments for the duration of the claim or the period specified in the policy.</li>

<ul>
<li>Disability insurance includes standard provisions intrinsic to essentially all DI policies. These benefits and restrictions are often specialized to meet the circumstances of the insured.</li>
<li>These special situations are met by the insurance industry by putting in place riders to policies.</li>
<li>Riders refer to special provisions that are unique to that policy; they are put in place to meet the needs of the applicant.</li>

<h4 id="2241-concept-of-customization">2.2.4.1 Concept of customization<a class="headerlink" href="#2241-concept-of-customization" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Customizing refers to adjusting a standard DI policy’s terms and conditions by adding riders to the contract.</li>
<li>As stated, a rider customizes a policy to meet the needs of the applicant by adding, removing or restricting benefits according to the insurance company in order to minimize its exposure to risk.</li>
<li>Some of the most common riders are discussed in the subsequent section.</li>

<h4 id="2242-differences-between-equivalent-riders">2.2.4.2 Differences between “equivalent” riders<a class="headerlink" href="#2242-differences-between-equivalent-riders" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Strict standards are not established for the definitions that apply to riders.</li>
<li>Riders offered by different insurers need to be carefully compared and scrutinized in precise detail by the agent to be certain that they are equivalent.</li>
<li>The agent should not assume that a specific rider will offer standard benefits within each contract even if there are standard definitions within the industry.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2243-future-purchase-option-fpo">2.2.4.3 Future purchase option (FPO)<a class="headerlink" href="#2243-future-purchase-option-fpo" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The future purchase option (FPO) is also referred to as the guaranteed insurability benefit (GIB) or the guaranteed insurability option (GIO).</li>
<li>FPO gives the insured the right to increase the benefit at future times or on the policy anniversary without proof of insurability.<ul>
<li>However, the benefit payment can never exceed 60% of pre-disability earned income. Thus, if the coverage currently in force is 60% of pre-disability income, no further coverage can be purchased, even though the right to purchase coverage without medical evidence is guaranteed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the past, around every two years, the insured was given the option to increase his coverage.</li>
<li>Now, the policies issued offer the options to increase on the anniversary of the policy.</li>
<li>Any new coverage attained under the FPO is issued based on the life insured’s attained age at the time the option is exercised. Depending on the contract, options are usually available up to the life insured’s age of 50 or 55.<ul>
<li>The way in which attained age is calculated depends on the contract terms (i.e., on age on last birthday, age on next birthday or age nearest a birthday).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a maximum amount of coverage that can be purchased per option and overall:<ul>
<li>Each option is often limited to 20% of base coverage to a maximum of $1,500 a month of new coverage;</li>
<li>The overall limit is in the range of two to five times the initial amount of coverage under the base policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the insured has remained in the same occupation, new coverage obtained through the FPO is based on the same occupational class as the original policy.</li>
<li>The contract may allow the FPO to go into effect right away or the exercise may be put off until the current claim’s termination if the life insured is on disability claim when the option arises.</li>
<li>The main limit in using the FPO is that the insured must qualify for the extra coverage from a financial perspective. The insured must provide the insurer with a proof of their current income.</li>
<li>Exercising the FPO increases coverage which in turn increases the premium.</li>
<li>In terms of an FPO, no further coverage can be bought if the coverage currently in force is equal to 60% of earned income (despite the fact that the right to buy coverage without medical evidence is guaranteed).</li>
<li>Two rules are applicable:<ul>
<li>The current option may not be exercised if the current income of the insured has stayed the same since policy issue or exercise of the last option, and the coverage currently in force equates to 60% of current income.</li>
<li>If the 60% of the current income of the insured is greater than the current coverage in force, the option may be exercised to a maximum of the current option or an amount that would bring the coverage up to 60% of current income, whichever is less.</li>

He qualified medically and financially and was issued a DI policy with coverage of $3,000 a month ((60% × $60,000) ÷ 12). His policy has an FPO rider which permits him to increase coverage, guaranteed, by 20% of his original coverage (or $600 a month), this year if he can qualify financially. His income has increased by $6,000, to $66,000 a year. At his new income level, Fritz could qualify financially for $3,300 a month of disability coverage ((60% × $66,000) ÷ 12).</p>
<p>Since he already holds $3,000 a month of coverage, he could only exercise the FPO to acquire an additional $300 a month of coverage, despite the fact that the option allows for up to $600 a month of coverage without medical underwriting.</p>

<h4 id="2244-cost-of-living-adjustment-cola">2.2.4.4 Cost of living adjustment (COLA)<a class="headerlink" href="#2244-cost-of-living-adjustment-cola" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Inflation increases the cost of living. Those who depend on long-term disability benefits as income will find that, over time, their purchasing power is reduced due to inflation and the fixed nature of the disability benefit. This is a problem that insured’s face who depend on LTD benefits as their primary source of income.</li>
<li>The cost of living adjustment (COLA) rider increases the monthly benefit being paid under a disability income replacement contract annually, beginning in the second year benefits are paid. The increase is either:<ul>
<li>Simple: The benefit is indexed by a set percentage increase (e.g., 2.00% or 4.00%) of the initial benefit payable;</li>
<li>Compound: Following the claim’s first year, on a compound basis, the benefit is indexed to the rate of inflation and is thus increased by the CPI every year. In other words, the monthly benefit is increased based on the inflation rate for the previous calendar opposed to the initial benefit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Jennifer is entitled to $3,000 a month in benefits under a DI policy indexed to the CPI and under which the COLA is compounded. The following table demonstrates how her monthly benefit will increase every year due to the compounded COLA.

</div>
<ul>
<li>Some policies limit a maximum annual indexing rate (i.e., 5%).</li>
<li>Many policies may also carry forward an unused allotment to future years:<ul>
<li>For example, if the indexing rate for year 4 of a claim is 1.5% lower than the maximum allowed under the contract, that 1.5% can be carried forward to years in the future, to create more indexing room for years when the inflation rate exceeds the maximum annual indexing permitted under the contract.</li>
<li>Furthermore, policies put in place a predetermined limit for the maximum amount of indexing so that the annual benefit paid out under an indexed policy does not surpass two or three times the initial, un-indexed, annual benefit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An automatic coverage enhancement, also called an automatic benefit increase, is an alternative (not an addition) to the COLA rider offered by some DI policies. Every year the benefit automatically increases, without a medical or financial underwriting, by a small fixed percentage (i.e., 2 or 3%) and the premium increases in step with the enhanced benefit.<ul>
<li>The enhancement may be reviewed and underwritten on a periodic basis (i.e., every 5 years).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The benefit provides an indexed policy with increasing premiums that applies the increase in coverage after the policy is issued and does not wait for a claim to be made. It basically attempts to keep up with annual raises that most employees receive.</li>

<ul>
<li>Partial disability benefits are intended to encourage re-entry to the workplace.</li>
<li>This is due to the fact that if the insured would receive full benefits in the event of total disability but no benefits if he were to return into the workforce part-time—it would be hard to encourage a disabled worker to return to work part-time.
<strong>- Residual disability benefits</strong></li>
<li>Residual disability benefits encourage disabled workers to return to the workplace as soon as they are physically able.</li>
<li>A residual disability benefit is a type of partial benefit offered by many DI policies. This means that if the insured is able to work part-time following a total disability period, the disabled will receive a portion of his benefits.</li>
<li>The life insured must first experience total disability (a complete inability to work) for a specified minimum amount of time including the waiting period (typically 6 months including the waiting period) to qualify for a residual disability benefit.</li>
<li>When total disability has ceased, the benefit is paid if the disabled can return to work and perform some substantial duties or can perform all substantial duties some of the time.</li>
<li>Therefore, once the insured returns back to work, he will be receiving two forms of income—both, part of the disability benefit and the employment income.</li>
<li>In order for an insured to qualify for residual benefits, there are specific requirements regarding both the insured’s minimum and maximum income:<ul>
<li>Pre-disability income must be reduced by 20% or more to receive the benefit;</li>
<li>In other words, if the life insured earns 80% or more of his pre-disability income, he will not receive the residual benefit;</li>
<li>Therefore, if he earns between 20% and 80% of what he earned working, he receives a benefit in proportion to the percentage of income not received;</li>
<li>The life insured will receive the full benefit if he earns 20% or less of his pre-disability income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are three steps to determine the total income received by taking the residual benefit:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Determine the percentage of income that is lost which is calculated as:
<img alt="picture 76" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dekingtt/statics/images/2022-01-07-01-171.png" />  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply the percentage of income that is lost against the full disability benefit received which is calculated as:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-2-1" name="__codelineno-2-1" href="#__codelineno-2-1"></a>    Full benefit x % of income lost = residual benefit
</code></pre></div></p>
</li>
<li>Add the residual benefit to income earned = income received which is calculated as:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-3-1" name="__codelineno-3-1" href="#__codelineno-3-1"></a> Residual benefit + income earned = income received

</div>
<p><strong>- Partial disability benefits</strong>
- Partial disability benefits are paid by insurance contracts from the beginning of disability.
    - This does not require a proof of total disability.</p>
<ul>
<li>When due to disability, the insured cannot perform some of his job’s principal duties (or can only perform them for part of the time), the policy provides the insured with 50% of his total disability benefit for a specific period of two to three years.</li>
<li>The benefits come from the partial disability benefit or the residual disability benefit—whichever is greater.</li>
<li>The DI contracts generally ask that:<ul>
<li>The insured be under the care of a physician;</li>
<li>The insured undergoes an initial qualification period of total disability before the partial disability benefits will be paid to the insured;</li>
<li>Partial disability benefits vary between insurance companies—the agent must ensure that the policy details are clear to an applicant.</li>

<h4 id="2247-return-of-premium-rop">2.2.4.7 Return of premium (ROP)<a class="headerlink" href="#2247-return-of-premium-rop" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A policyholder may pay thousands of dollars of premiums over the course of their DI policy and never receive any of the money because they never needed to file a valid claim.</li>
<li>The return of premium (ROP) rider addresses this concern and provides a tax-free refund of premiums paid if, when the policy expires, total claims paid are less than total premiums paid. For example:<ul>
<li>If by age 65, no valid claims have been paid, the insured will receive 70% of all premiums paid;</li>
<li>If the total claims paid during the policy’s lifetime are less than the total amount of premiums paid, the difference would be paid back to the insured upon the maturity date of the coverage;</li>
<li>If the claims paid out to the insured surpass the amount of premiums paid, then no return of premiums is payable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some policies state that the rider may also apply if a policy is cancelled before its expiration date and no claims have been paid out on the policy. In this case, a partial ROP is often paid.</li>
<li>Some policies also state that if the contract lasts for a specific duration (generally 8 or 10 years) without paying a claim, anywhere from 4 times the annual premium to at least 70 – 80% of the premiums paid during that period OR a percentage of the annual premium will be paid back to the insured.</li>
<li>This rider is expensive and may increase the base DI premium by 40–60%.</li>

<h4 id="2248-ratings-and-exclusion-riders">2.2.4.8 Ratings and exclusion riders<a class="headerlink" href="#2248-ratings-and-exclusion-riders" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>When the risk that the life insured may make a claim appears more likely than what is considered standard, his application may be:<ul>
<li>Declined—not issuing the policy;</li>
<li>Charged a higher premium, called a premium rating;</li>
<li>An exclusion rider may be added to the policy;</li>
<li>Declining the policy is seen as a last option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A premium rating is an increased premium which assumes substandard risks and compensates the insurance company for the additional risk it assumes.</li>
<li>The premium rating does assume more risks than what is considered standard but, on the other hand, it does not assume risks that are too high either.</li>
<li>For example, an insured with an overall health issue such as diabetes will have to pay a premium rating to compensate the insurance company for the risk it assumes taking on a client with a health condition.</li>
<li>The insured may have the option to have a medical assessment in order to have the option re-underwritten as well as the rating lowered or taken off altogether if the condition improves in the future.</li>
<li>An exclusion rider will exclude a claim arising from a substandard risk such as a particular lifestyle, activity or condition that has a greater risk of causing a disability.</li>
<li>For example, a scuba diver has a greater risk of becoming disabled than someone who does not scuba dive. Therefore, scuba diving would most likely be excluded from the rider.</li>
<li>In these cases, the insurance company will issue the policy but with an exclusion rider, excluding the particular risky activity from the policy so that if a disability does arise from the identified activity it will not be paid. Typically, the contract would then be issued with a standard premium in order for other standard episodes of disability to be covered by the rider.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Eldridge applied for disability income replacement insurance despite the fact that he had a damaged disk in his back, the consequence of his sporting activities.

<li>Hospital costs are a common expense not covered by the standard DI policy.</li>
<li>In this case, either a hospitalization benefit rider or a hospital indemnity rider can be added to a DI policy to cover those expenses.</li>
<li>There are two hospital-stay related benefits available as riders:<ul>
<li>The first-day hospitalization benefit:</li>
<li>Provides a benefit between the time when the life insured is admitted to hospital and the first day the disability benefits begin (typically 90 days later);</li>
<li>The insured must usually stay in the hospital for 18–72 hours for the benefits to be payable;</li>
<li>Its payment is made on a daily basis, as a percentage of the monthly benefit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The hospital indemnity rider:<ul>
<li>Covers expenses that arise from hospitalization of the life insured, such as parking, child care and transportation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provided as a daily sum, usually between $50 and $250.</li>

<ul>
<li>Whether the benefits are received as taxable or tax-free income impacts the amount of disability insurance for which an applicant can qualify.</li>
<li>Tax-free benefits represent a greater proportion of the insured’s pre-disability net income.</li>
<li>Furthermore, the applicant’s ability to afford the coverage is partially dependent on whether or not premiums paid for disability insurance can be deducted for income tax purposes.</li>

<ul>
<li>Premiums paid for individual disability income replacement policies are not tax deductible and benefits are received tax-free. Such is the case for the following benefits:<ul>
<li>Disability income benefits;</li>
<li>Treatments received by the life insured and paid for by the life insurance company; for example, physiotherapy;</li>
<li>Waiver of premium;</li>
<li>Return of premium refunds (ROP) benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For businesses:<ul>
<li>A DI policy taken out on the life of an employee where the employer pays the premium and is a beneficiary of the contract—the policy premiums are not a tax-deductible business expense. Business overhead expense (BOE) is an exception to this rule.</li>
<li>Different tax rules apply to individual DI policies taken out by an employer on a class of employees;</li>
<li>If an unincorporated employer takes out a DI policy on an employee’s life and the benefits are payable to the employee, the premiums are likely tax-deductible by the employer. Premiums paid by the employer or benefits received by the employee would be treated as taxable income for the employee—one or the other, not both.</li>

<ul>
<li>There is little difference in the taxation of personally-owned and corporately-owned disability insurance policies.</li>
<li>Corporately-owned DI policies purchased in order to compensate the corporation in the event of the long-term disability of a key employee, or to buy out a permanently disabled shareholder’s interests, are treated the same as a personally-owned DI policy.</li>
<li>The premiums paid are not tax-deductible and benefits received by a corporation are not a taxable inclusion.</li>
<li>If a corporate DI policy insures an employee’s life (who is also the beneficiary of any policy benefits), the premiums will be a:<ul>
<li>Deductible business expense for the employer; and a taxable item to the employee for the year in which they were paid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a corporate DI policy insures a shareholder of the company (or both an employee and a shareholder), the premiums will be:<ul>
<li>Likely administered as a shareholder benefit by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA);</li>
<li>Non-deductible by the employer and;</li>

<ul>
<li>Conversion refers to a provision in most life insurance policies which states that the life insured may, with the same insurer, transfer a term insurance policy into a permanent policy without having to prove medical insurability.</li>
<li>Non-term individual disability income insurance policies do not follow the same concept of conversion. A conversion clause will be included in BOE and buy-sell insurance policies.</li>
<li>Certain types of business disability insurance policies may permit the life insured to transfer the policy and its benefits to a personal policy (i.e., when the policy is no longer needed for business use). This converts the policy from a corporate policy to a personal policy.</li>
<li>There is no medical underwriting when the conversion occurs; it happens when a claim is made.</li>
<li>Also, DI policies that are non-cancellable often provide the policyholder with the choice to convert the policy at age 65 to a guaranteed renewable policy, with a restricted duration and benefit period.</li>

<ul>
<li>Group DI coverage is most often provided to group members without proof of medical writing.</li>
<li>Therefore, issuing the life insurance to a particular group provides the insurer with an element of shared characteristics among the group members (i.e., they all have, more or less, the same amount of risk).</li>
<li>Examples of groups that possess common characteristics are:<ul>
<li>They work for the same employer;</li>
<li>They work in the same industry;</li>
<li>They are members of the same association;</li>
<li>They are alumni of the same university or college;</li>
<li>They belong to the same union.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The common characteristics offer at least two advantages:<ul>
<li>The existence of the group means the insurance company can underwrite a policy on its shared characteristics.</li>

<li>Short-term disability is also referred to as a weekly indemnity.</li>
<li>It provides a benefit no longer than one year in duration. If disability persists after one year, short-term disability is replaced by long-term disability.</li>
<li>STD benefits are based on a percentage of the insured’s salary:<ul>
<li>The benefit amount is 70%-75% of salary;</li>

<li>The benefit period begins:<ul>
<li>Seven days after disability caused by illness;</li>
<li>The day that disability is caused by an accident.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The own occupation definition of disability applies. Therefore, the benefit is paid if the disability of the life insured prevents him from working at his regular occupation.</li>
<li>STD plans insuring lower-paid workers often coordinate with Employment Insurance (EI) so that the insured receives the benefits of EI or STD during their benefit period.</li>

<div class="admonition example">

<p>The company Myron works for offers its employees’ a group disability plan which includes both STD and LTD coverage, providing for a combined 5-year benefit period (12 months for STD and 48 months for LTD). Normally, Myron earns $4,000 a month, when working. A couple of months ago Myron injured himself when a golf cart that he was riding on during a weekend tournament tipped over and badly damaged his leg.</p>
<p>Myron’s job as a plant supervisor requires him to walk around the plant regularly to oversee the work of the employees, so his injury qualified him as “disabled” under the “own occupation” definition of disability under his STD coverage. The plan provides a benefit equal to 70% of salary, so Myron will receive disability payments of $2,800 a month ( $4,000 × 70%) for up to 12 months or until he returns to work, whichever comes first. If Myron is still disabled after 12 months, his coverage will change from short-term disability to long-term disability.</p>

<ul>
<li>EI is often a second payor of disability coverage. The following way of staggering EI and STD benefits ensures that this dollar-for-dollar reduction of EI benefits is avoided:<ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In a non-participating group DI plan (or non-par plan), the employer pays the total premium monthly on behalf of all employees. The employer pays for all of the coverage—the employees do not contribute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a participating group DI plan, the employees contribute to the premium. The sum is collected from each employee by payroll deduction. The employer makes the premium payment, which is a combination of the employee contributions and employer contributions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Association group plans usually pay their premium by direct withdrawal from a bank account.</li>

<ul>
<li>The non-evidence maximum coverage is in place to ensure that all group members receive a base level of benefits regardless of their income and health.</li>
<li>No medical underwriting is required.</li>
<li>This basic coverage is set in place taking into account the insurer’s risk and plan sponsor’s costs.</li>

<ul>
<li>The maximum overall coverage is in place for plan members who would like additional coverage on top of the basic non-evidence plan coverage.</li>
<li>The maximum overall coverage has two main limits:<ul>
<li>Plan members must qualify financially for the additional coverage;</li>
<li>Plan members must also undergo medical underwriting and fully pay for such additional coverage.<ul>
<li>The maximum monthly benefit is stated in the master group plan. Maximum monthly benefits are often tied to group size—larger groups offer larger maximum monthly benefits whereas smaller groups offer a smaller amount.</li>
<li>The maximum coverage a plan member will receive is based on whichever amount is less: the group plan maximum or a percentage of his income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The employer/employee can also take out coverage that is less than the maximum amount stated in the master contract.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Chiang and Eng are members of the same employer-group DI program which provides for maximum long-term disability coverage of 60% of salary, or $5,000 a month, whichever is less. Chiang, who earns $90,000 a year, qualifies for a maximum benefit of $4,500 a month (( $90,000 × 60%) ÷ 12). Eng, who earns $120,000 a year, is restricted to the maximum monthly benefit of $5,000, despite the fact that his income could qualify him for $6,000 monthly benefit (( $120,000 × 60%) ÷ 12).</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Benefits can either be treated as taxable or non-taxable income. The percentage of earnings considered in setting the overall maximum coverage will depend on how the benefits are taxed:<ul>
<li>STD benefits are taxable and are usually in the higher percentage range, between 70 and 75% of pre-disability income;</li>
<li>LTD benefits are generally non-taxable and are usually in the higher percentage range, between 60% to 66.66% of pre-disability income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Brandi works for a company that offers group DI coverage. The non-evidence maximum amount of LTD coverage is 50% of salary and the maximum benefit is set at 66.66% of salary, to a maximum of $10,000 a month. Brandi earns $90,000 a year and has elected to take full coverage of $60,000 (66.66% of $90,000 – $5,000 a month). The first $45,000 of annual coverage (50% of salary) would be provided on a non-evidence basis, but Brandi would have to qualify medically to add the additional $15,000 of coverage (16.66% of salary).</p>

<ul>
<li>The all-sources maximum is in place to ensure that the employee still has an incentive to return to work—if the disabled individual receives benefits that match or exceed his pre-disability income he will not have a monetary incentive to return to work.</li>
<li>The group offset amendment is stated in the group master contract. It indicates the all-sources maximum, in other words, the maximum in benefits available from all sources direct and indirect. Direct sources are plans that pay monetary benefits directly to the disabled member such as:<ul>
<li>CPP/QPP;</li>
<li>Employment Insurance;</li>
<li>Workers’ Compensation;</li>
<li>Auto insurance disability benefits;</li>
<li>Association or other group benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Indirect sources are benefits paid to dependent spouses and children of the disabled life insured such as children’s benefit paid by CPP.</li>
<li>An individually-owned policy does not usually contribute to the all sources maximum, but such a policy may have its own offset rules.</li>
<li>The maximum that can be received from all sources is 85% of pre-disability income.</li>
<li>If the maximum is exceeded by a benefit or combination of benefits, the group plan benefit will be reduced to respect the 85% limit.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Mr. Lee earns $60,000 a year as a plumber. He is employed with a company that provides an LTD benefit equal to 66.67% of its employees’ regular, pre-disability income, or $3,333 a month (( $60,000 × 66.67%) ÷ 12). In the event of disability, Mr. Lee could also qualify for benefits of $1,020 a month from a personal policy, for a total of $4,353 a month of benefits. This would represent benefits of $52,236 a year, or 87.1% of his regular income. The 87.1% exceeds the 85% all sources maximum specified in the group plan’s master contract, so Mr. Lee’s monthly benefit from the group plan would be offset by $103 a month ( $4,353 – (85% × $60,000 ÷ 12)) to an amount of $3,230, bringing the total monthly benefit from all sources to $4,250, or 85% of his pre-disability income level.</p>

<li>STD and LTD benefits received by the employee are taxable income when the employer pays the premium.<ul>
<li>The premium is a deductible expense for the employer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, if the group member pays 100% of the LTD premium, the benefit is received by the employee tax-free.<ul>
<li>The premium is not a tax-deductible expense for the employee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If both the employer and group member contribute to the LTD premium, the benefit received by the employee, up to his total amount of premium contribution, is tax-free. Benefits greater than premiums paid are taxable income:<ul>
<li>The premium contribution by the employer is a deductible expense;</li>
<li>The premium contribution by the employee is not a deductible expense.</li>

<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Matti is a member of a group DI plan where the employer and the employee share the premium cost for all group benefits on a 50/50 basis. Up until now, Matti has never made a claim against the LTD benefits available under the plan. However, this year he was injured and ended up receiving a total of $17,000 in group LTD benefits. To date, Matti and his employer had shared the $8,200 in total premium paid on his behalf for the LTD coverage. For tax purposes, $4,100 of Matti’s benefits (his 50% of the $8,200 of total premiums paid) would be a tax-free refund of premiums and the other $12,900 ( $17,000 - $4,100) would be treated as taxable income.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clients can rely on both group and individual insurance simultaneously in order to meet their needs. An individual may choose to supplement the benefit amount or improve the benefit period of a group policy with an individual policy.
<strong>- Benefit amount</strong></li>
<li>A person who is covered by a group policy may find its benefit inadequate for his financial needs. Typically, STD coverage is 70–75% and LTD coverage is 60–66.66% of pre-disability income.</li>
<li>He could take out a personal disability income policy with an extended benefit to reach a level of benefit more suitable to his circumstances.</li>
<li>The individual DI policy would have the same definition of disability as well as the same benefit and waiting period as the group DI plan.</li>
<li>The 85% all sources maximum must be respected. Otherwise, offsets might void some of the advantage of the extra coverage, leaving the client paying for coverage from which he could never benefit.</li>
<li>Claims are filed against the group policy first (as “first payor”) and then against the personally owned plan, where there is an overlap in coverage.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Andre’s group policy offers LTD coverage of 60% of his $80,000 annual salary, or $4,000 a month of benefits ( $80,000 × 60% ÷ 12). He would be more comfortable with a 75% benefit level, or $5,000 a month ( $80,000 × 75% ÷ 12). He could supplement his group coverage by taking out an individual DI policy paying $1,000 a month of disability benefit, but otherwise on the same basis as the group plan.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>- Benefit period</strong>
- A group benefit period can be extended by an individual policy.
- The insured purchases an individual DI policy with the same definition of disability and benefits as the group plan but with an extended benefit period.
- The waiting period of the individual policy would become the benefit period of the group policy.</p>
<div class="admonition example">

<p>Amir has a group policy with a 60-day waiting period and a two-year benefit period (a total of 26 months). He applies for a policy with a 26-month waiting period and a five-year benefit period. The long waiting period reduces the premium for his personal policy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Creditors who belong to the same financial institution represent another group association classification.</li>
<li>Lenders (i.e., credit unions, banks, etc.) will often collaborate with a life insurance company to provide group DI coverage to protect debtors in the case of a disability – the DI insurance will make the scheduled payments towards the debt when the debtor cannot earn an income and is disabled.</li>
<li>Creditor disability insurance is often provided as a package deal and is included with the loan itself.</li>
<li>Benefits are received by the creditor tax-free.</li>
<li>The premium for a creditor disability insurance policy is not tax-deductible unless the loan has been taken for the purpose of earning income from a business or property.</li>
<li>Creditor disability insurance uses the “total disability” definition i.e., the inability to earn income due to an illness or an injury.</li>
<li>Typically, no medical underwriting is done at the time of the application. However, at the time of the claim, the insured may be retroactively underwritten.</li>
<li>There is a waiting period, generally 60 days.</li>
<li>Policy premiums and the monthly loan payments are combined – the benefits are thus debited to the account that provides the loan payment.</li>

<li>Group creditor DI benefits are connected to the insured’s agreement to make monthly payments towards the unpaid balance of the insured loan.</li>
<li>Generally, the benefit is calculated as a percentage of the remaining balance, taking into account the maximum allowable monthly and overall limit.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>A bank offers mortgage disability insurance that will pay a maximum benefit equal to the monthly principal and interest payments on the mortgage, to a maximum of $3,000 a month for 24 months.
