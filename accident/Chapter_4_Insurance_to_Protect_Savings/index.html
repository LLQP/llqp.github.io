<h2 id="41-types-of-extended-health-coverage-to-protect-savings">4.1 Types of Extended Health Coverage to Protect Savings<a class="headerlink" href="#41-types-of-extended-health-coverage-to-protect-savings" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Extended health coverage provides coverage for many medical expenses. Some expenses are continual - such as a recurring prescription. Others arise suddenly as a result of an accident or illness.</li>
<li>All such costs can reduce cash flow available for savings or require an individual to dip into savings for payment or income needs.</li>
<li>Extended health insurance reduces the risk of losing savings to health care expenses.</li>
<li>A policy may be purchased directly from an agent - the policy owner is typically the person who makes claims and receives the policy benefits.</li>
<li>Policies are available to:<ul>
<li>Individuals (as personal policies); and</li>
<li>Members of group plans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extended health insurance is also offered by financial institutions (i.e., banks, credit unions, etc.) to their credit customers with limited coverage. This coverage is not common enough to be discussed in this chapter.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="411-individual-extended-health-insurance">4.1.1 Individual extended health insurance<a class="headerlink" href="#411-individual-extended-health-insurance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Each provincial government provides health insurance to its residents.</li>
<li>Provincial health care coverage includes many forms of medical care and treatment at home and within Canada. It also provides a reimbursement for a portion of medical expenses incurred outside Canada.</li>
<li>An individual extended health insurance policy supplements the coverage provided by the provincial plan or group health care plan.</li>
<li>The policyholder buys the plan directly from the insurance agent. The policyholder chooses the plan benefits and limits that best suit their needs and circumstances.</li>
<li>The policy can be cancelled at any time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="412-group-extended-health-coverage">4.1.2 Group extended health coverage<a class="headerlink" href="#412-group-extended-health-coverage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Group plans provide coverage to many Canadians for extended health services. The coverage is provided as a predetermined range of services, with set limits and some options (such as additional family coverage).</li>
<li>Group plans cover a group of individuals who typically share an occupation, association or employment in common.</li>
<li>The majority of individuals who have extended health insurance are insured under a group plan through their work.</li>
<li>The policyholder is typically an employer; the group members are the employees.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="42-types-of-extended-health-coverage-to-protect-savings">4.2 Types of Extended Health Coverage to Protect Savings<a class="headerlink" href="#42-types-of-extended-health-coverage-to-protect-savings" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Typically, individual extended health coverage options reflect those offered with group plans:<ul>
<li>Medical care;</li>
<li>Dental care;</li>
<li>Travel insurance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Individual policies permit that the insured chooses one or more of these options to form a health plan in line with their personal needs.</li>
<li>This is opposed to group policies which require that these options be compiled into a contract of predetermined benefits.</li>
<li>Therefore, when choosing the individual extended health plan, both the types and level of coverage are left up to the individual in terms of their needs and finances.</li>
<li>Full underwriting applies to policies except travel insurance. Travel policies apply underwriting when a claim is made.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="421-medical-care">4.2.1 Medical care<a class="headerlink" href="#421-medical-care" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Medical care coverage is provided to:<ul>
<li>Those who want to add coverage to their existing provincial health care insurance;</li>
<li>New residents of Canada who have not yet qualified for their provincial health care insurance; and</li>
<li>Members of group plans who want to add coverage on top of their group plan and their existing provincial health-care insurance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4211-coverage-provided">4.2.1.1 Coverage provided<a class="headerlink" href="#4211-coverage-provided" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Coverage for individuals is available for:<ul>
<li>Extended health care—for example, hospital services not covered by provincial health care insurance such as a semi-private or private hospital room;</li>
<li>Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&amp;D);</li>
<li>Prescription drugs;</li>
<li>Dental care;</li>
<li>Vision care;</li>
<li>Emergency travel medical.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Again, the applicant can pick and choose what types and the amount of coverage to include in the contract in terms of their budget and needs.</li>
<li>Some contractual restrictions put out by the insurance company do apply.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4212-deductibles-and-co-insurance">4.2.1.2 Deductibles and co-insurance<a class="headerlink" href="#4212-deductibles-and-co-insurance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Deductibles and co-insurance refer to provisions that require the insured to pay a portion of the covered medical expenses out of pocket.</li>
<li>Their purpose is to reduce the premium cost by:<ul>
<li>Making the insured responsible for a portion of the qualifying costs; and</li>
<li>Discouraging the insured from making unnecessary claims due to their responsibility for a portion of the qualifying cost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They may apply to all forms of coverage as well as both individual and group plans.</li>
<li>A deductible refers to a dollar cost that the insured must pay in full of otherwise covered benefits before insurance claims will be paid by the insurance company.</li>
<li>A deductible is charged annually and restarts anew every year.</li>
<li>A deductible is most common in a group plan.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Jose’s extended health insurance plan has a $100 annual deductible for dental benefits: he must pay the first $100 of dental expenses annually himself, without reimbursement from his plan.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Co-insurance refers to a cost expressed as a percentage that the insured pays on each claim. The insurance company pays the balance of the claim.</li>
<li>Co-insurance limits the insured’s coverage.</li>
<li>Co-insurance is applied to every claim.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="422-dental-care">4.2.2 Dental care<a class="headerlink" href="#422-dental-care" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Dental care is not generally provided by provincial health plans.</li>
<li>Therefore, dental care is often the backbone of the individual extended health coverage plan.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Consuela has purchased an individual extended health policy that has an 80% co-insurance factor for dental claims. The plan pays for 80% of each claim and Consuela assumes responsibility for the other 20%.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="4221-coverage-provided">4.2.2.1 Coverage provided<a class="headerlink" href="#4221-coverage-provided" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Dental insurance coverage is categorized as routine maintenance and major restorative services.</li>
<li>
<p>Routine maintenance is just as its name describes: routine dental services to maintain healthy teeth. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular check-ups;</li>
<li>Periodic X-rays;</li>
<li>Cleaning;</li>
<li>Fillings;</li>
<li>Extractions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an annual maximum to what will be paid for routine services and often co-insurance that requires the insured to pay 20%-25% of costs.</p>
</li>
<li>Major restorative services include crowns, bridges, dentures and other major dental procedures.</li>
<li>A much higher co-insurance factor applies to major restorative services—the insured may be required to pay as much as 50% of the cost.</li>
<li>Claims for both categories are also limited to a fee schedule set provincially by each dental association. For example, if a provincial dental association has a schedule that specifies a filling costs $200, and an insured’s claim for a filling is $250, the insured will need to pay the $50 in excess ( $250 - $200 = $50).</li>
<li>For extensive dental care (i.e., in the $500 or more range), insurers generally require that the insured have the dentist submit an estimate before the dental work takes place in order to predetermine coverage cost.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Igor’s dentist charges $300 for a basic tooth extraction. The provincial dental schedule sets the price of a standard extraction at a maximum of $225. Igor will have to pay the difference of $75 himself since his dental coverage is restricted to the amount specified in the schedule. The policy’s co-insurance factor will further increase the amount he must pay.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="4222-deductibles-and-co-insurance">4.2.2.2 Deductibles and co-insurance<a class="headerlink" href="#4222-deductibles-and-co-insurance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Deductibles and co-insurance are also applied to dental insurance claims to regulate premiums for extended health coverage.</li>
<li>Dental insurance uses the most amounts of deductibles and co-insurance services.</li>
<li>This is because medical services are generally partially or fully paid by the provincial health-care plans, whereas dental plans typically are not. This leaves the cost of the dental expenses up to the individual and insurance company to cover.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="423-travel-insurance">4.2.3 Travel insurance<a class="headerlink" href="#423-travel-insurance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Travel insurance is a broad term that encompasses both emergency medical care needed when travelling and may cover some or all of the following:<ul>
<li>Emergency medical expenses;</li>
<li>Costs for lost or damaged luggage;</li>
<li>Trip cancellation;</li>
<li>Return home of an ill or injured traveller.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Medical expenses incurred abroad may be reimbursed by the provincial health care plan of the patient according to the schedule set by the provincial health-care plan. Because provincial health coverage varies among the different provinces, an expense may be covered in one province but not another.</li>
<li>The patient must be prepared to pay costs charged outside Canada personally and then file receipts with their provincial plan on their return. For example, if the AHCIP (Alberta health care plan) schedule is set at $175 for a visit to the office of a specialist in the U.S., and the cost paid by the patient is $375, the patient pays $375 and gets $175 from AHCIP. The uninsured patient is out of pocket $200.</li>
<li>Travel insurance is particularly critical when travelling with the cost of hospitalization being generally higher abroad than it is in Canada and can be draining to an individual’s savings and cash flow if that individual is not insured.</li>
<li>Travel insurance coverage is offered by travel agents, and directly from insurers, financial institutions, airlines and online providers.</li>
<li>The insured must understand what is covered under their travel insurance policy, as different policies offer a wide range of services as well as levels of coverage.</li>
<li>Some jurisdictions do not require an insurance license to sell travel insurance.</li>
<li>Medical underwriting is done when the claim is made—not at the issuance of the policy.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4231-coverage-provided-by-an-insurer">4.2.3.1 Coverage provided by an insurer<a class="headerlink" href="#4231-coverage-provided-by-an-insurer" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Travel insurance can cover virtually all conceivable medical charges arising from an accident or illness. It does not cover elective procedures, such as cosmetic surgery.</li>
<li>Coverage’s available include, among others:<ul>
<li>Doctors’ and nurses’ fees;</li>
<li>Hospitalization costs;</li>
<li>Medical equipment;</li>
<li>Ambulance services;</li>
<li>Dental costs for accidental injury;</li>
<li>Return of the injured traveller to their province of residence;</li>
<li>Return of a deceased traveller’s remains to their province of residence;</li>
<li>Return of the insured’s vehicle to their province of residence;</li>
<li>Lost baggage insurance;</li>
<li>Trip interruption or cancellation due to illness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The insurer often provides the insured with a contact card with the name and number of a provider to be contacted when an emergency occurs.</li>
<li>The contact can assist the insured by ordering an ambulance for them as well as directing them to the nearest place where they can seek medical assistance (i.e., a hospital, clinic, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4232-coverage-provided-through-a-credit-card">4.2.3.2 Coverage provided through a credit card<a class="headerlink" href="#4232-coverage-provided-through-a-credit-card" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Credit cards often provide travel medical coverage as an option or standard coverage that comes automatically with the card.</li>
<li>Coverage from a credit card is typically not as comprehensive as coverage with an insurance policy.</li>
<li>Coverage can differ greatly based on the provider and card type.</li>
<li>Some require their card to be used to book the trip before providing medical coverage. For example, if Sally uses her MasterCard to book her trip, her VISA card medical coverage may not apply.</li>
<li>There is no medical evidence of insurability required.</li>
<li>When a claim is made, the insurer determines if the claim is covered under the terms of the coverage.</li>
<li>However, a claim may be denied if it is discovered to be a pre-existing condition.</li>
<li>Therefore, the insured is never completely sure if a claim will be honoured under the travel insurance provided through a credit card.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4233-pre-existing-conditions">4.2.3.3 Pre-existing conditions<a class="headerlink" href="#4233-pre-existing-conditions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A pre-existing condition is a medical condition experienced by the insured up to 180 days before departure. It includes:<ul>
<li>A visit to a doctor for specific symptoms needing treatment;</li>
<li>Medical tests or a prescription for medical tests;</li>
<li>Medical treatment for a condition or a prescription for medical treatment;</li>
<li>A change to a prescription (this includes stopping the prescription, or decreasing dosage or frequency).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In some cases, insureds failing to disclose to the insurer that they take a daily preventative baby aspirin against stroke or heart attack could lead to a denial of the claim since this is viewed as not disclosing a pre-existing condition related to medication.</li>
<li>Chronic conditions are health conditions that are long-lasting or recur frequently (ex. diabetes).</li>
<li>Chronic conditions that were diagnosed prior to the 90-or 180-day period may result in restricted coverage if the individual has not had to see a doctor for the condition or experienced any symptoms for up to one year before the trip. (ex. the insured may be required to demonstrate that he has been symptom-free of diabetes for atleast one year to qualify for full coverage).</li>
<li>A pre-existing condition does not void all coverage—however, the condition must be revealed and the underwriter decides whether to manage the risk by exclusion or a higher premium.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Antonio, a resident of Québec, scheduled a 30-day trip to his native Italy. Before his departure, he took out travel insurance through his local credit union. Antonio has been taking medication for epilepsy for the past 12 years, medication that does not always fully control his symptoms. If Antonio were to require treatment due to an epileptic seizure while in Italy, his treatment expenses would not be covered.

<h4 id="4234-benefits">4.2.3.4 Benefits<a class="headerlink" href="#4234-benefits" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The benefit is usually received as a reimbursement of expenses.</li>
<li>The insured pays for the medical expenses when they occur and then submit a claim to the insurer with accompanying receipts.</li>
<li>This reimbursement system allows the insurer to pay for their health care expenses as well as the provincial health plan to pay for their portion.</li>
<li>To qualify for a benefit, the insured must immediately contact the name and number provided on the insurance card they were given when they bought the policy.</li>
<li>There are standard exclusions for the benefit, such as attempted suicide, war, self-inflicted injuries, normal pregnancy, and drug or alcohol abuse.</li>
<li>Certain exclusions are specific to travel insurance and are not common to other types of insurance:<ul>
<li>A hazardous activity (i.e., parasailing, scuba diving, etc.);</li>
<li>Travel to countries which are on the travel advisory list published by Global Affairs Canada;</li>
<li>When treatment is obtained for a non-emergency.</li>

<ul>
<li>The amount of coverage and length of the trip are the main factors in determining the premium.</li>
<li>Premiums are based on:</li>
<li>Amount of coverage;<ul>
<li>Often determined as the dollar cost of the trip, or range of services requested;</li>
<li>For example, a policy with trip-cancellation insurance will cost more than a policy without.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Length of the trip;<ul>
<li>However, the premium is generally not proportionally higher because of the general processing fees of all policies. For example, a 50-day policy will not be 5 times the price of a 10-day policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risks covered—the higher the risk, the higher premium;</li>
<li>Destination;<ul>
<li>Other provinces in Canada pose the least risk—a low premium is paid due to similar medical costs across the provinces;</li>
<li>U.S. and other countries outside of Canada pose a higher risk—a higher premium is paid due to higher medical costs;</li>
<li>Other countries outside of Canada considered high-risk zones (i.e., some countries in the Middle East and Latin America)—a much higher premium is paid.</li>
<li>Countries outside of Canada considered too high-risk—the insurer will not issue coverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Age of traveller;<ul>
<li>Individuals over 65 years pay higher premiums because they are more liable to injury or illness.</li>

<ul>
<li>Group extended health insurance covers a wide range of medical services that the provincial health care plans do not cover fully or at all.</li>
<li>A group health plan is controlled by its sponsor—usually an employer.</li>
<li>The details of the plan are in the master contract issued to the sponsor.</li>
<li>Coverage ends if the plan member departs from the group.</li>
<li>A unique advantage of the group plan is that there is no underwriting for group members or their family members under the plan—consequently pre-existing conditions are covered.</li>

<ul>
<li>A prescription drug plan is an important part of an extended group policy since so many people use prescription drugs in their lives on a periodic or daily basis to treat illness.</li>
<li>Medication is either sold as:<ul>
<li>Prescription drugs – can only be obtained with a prescription;</li>
<li>Non-prescription drugs (over-the-counter drugs) – can be obtained at any store that sells over-the-counter drugs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only prescription drugs are covered by group plans.</li>
<li>Prescription drugs are often available in both:<ul>
<li>Brand-name; and<ul>
<li>A brand-name drug is manufactured by the pharmaceutical corporation that researched and developed it. A patent protects the company’s investment. Other manufacturers will be free to make and sell their own version of the same drug, the generic version, once the brand-name drug patent runs out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generic form.<ul>
<li>The generic drug has the same properties as the brand-name drug but is typically much cheaper.</li>
<li>An insured who insists on the brand-name version will usually need to pay the difference between the price of the generic and the brand name options.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A group plan will list:<ul>

<ul>
<li>As discussed, provincial health plans do not fully cover all the health care expenses an individual may incur.</li>
<li>Group enhanced medical benefit (also referred to as the enhanced health care benefit) plans supplement services not fully covered or not covered at all by provincial health-care plans. These may include:<ul>
<li>Practitioners such as chiropractors, massage therapists, naturopaths, and optometrists;</li>
<li>Medical expenses to a maximum annual limit, such as ambulance cost;</li>
<li>Medical devices, such as crutches; and</li>
<li>Upgrades to a semi-private or private hospital stays to a maximum daily limit and a maximum duration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There may be a co-insurance contribution required by the plan member for enhanced care costs, but there is usually no deductible.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>As a resident of Ontario, Jonah is entitled to a ward bed in a hospital, paid for entirely by the provincial health plan, if he is ill or injured and requires hospital treatment.

<h4 id="4313-dental-care">4.3.1.3 Dental care<a class="headerlink" href="#4313-dental-care" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The cost of providing dental insurance to groups is more expensive than other forms of insurance because:<ul>
<li>Services are provided continually (i.e., twice-a-year check-ups);</li>
<li>Dental care does not require a physical referral—it is entirely discretionary;</li>
<li>Provincial health care does not cover dental expenses (emergency medical dental care may be an exception)—the insurer and individual must therefore cover the entire dental expense;</li>
<li>Dental care is high cost in general;</li>
<li>Family is often included in group dental plans;</li>
<li>The plan’s sponsor (i.e., employer) is typically responsible for the premiums for the coverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Group dental plans reduce their costs through:<ul>
<li>Deductibles and co-insurance;</li>
<li>Annual maximum coverage;</li>
<li>Lifetime maximum coverage;</li>
<li>Pre-approval of some costs (for example, pre-approval of semiannual teeth cleaning, periodic check-ups, X-rays and a maximum limit to orthodontic work);</li>
<li>Excluding cosmetic work, such as whitening.</li>

<ul>
<li>Vision care coverage is an important part of most group health plans.</li>
<li>Group vision care reimburses expenses for visual impairment regarding:<ul>
<li>Prescription glasses and contact lenses;</li>
<li>Optometrist fees (when not covered by the provincial health plan).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Coverage is typically limited to between $100 and $350 every 2 years for glasses prescribed by an optometrist.</li>
<li>Glasses will only be covered if they are prescribed by an optometrist. New glasses will only be issued in the stated time frame if the insured needs glasses for the first time or their prescription changes.</li>
<li>Optometrist’s fees are also sometimes covered by the insurer every 2 years to a maximum dollar amount, in provinces where these fees are not covered by provincial health plans.</li>

<ul>
<li>AD&amp;D is a common part of most extended group and individual health plans.</li>
<li>
<p>Like AD&amp;D described elsewhere, coverage provides a benefit to the insured if dismemberment occurs (i.e., the loss of hearing, a limb etc.) and a benefit to the beneficiary if the insured dies as the result of an accident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Death of the insured: the benefit is paid as a fixed amount (referred to as the principal sum) and is payable to the beneficiary.</p>
</li>
<li>Dismembering accident of the insured: the benefit is paid as a percentage of the insured amount calculated in regard to the severity of the dismemberment—for example, the loss of use of an arm pays a benefit equal to 75% of the insured amount.</li>
<li>In order for a claim to be paid, death must occur within 365 days of an accident; and dismemberment must be a direct result of the accident.</li>
<li>Table 4.1 demonstrates the benefit payable due to accidental death or a dismembering accident.

<h3 id="432-benefits">4.3.2 Benefits<a class="headerlink" href="#432-benefits" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The group plan benefit is paid as a reimbursement of costs or by direct billing.</li>
<li>Benefits may not cover the entirety of all medical expenses:</li>
<li>Some medical expenses are not included in the plan—no benefit is payable for such expenses;</li>
<li>Many medical expenses are subject to an annual maximum as well as co-payments—benefits are payable to a certain defined amount.<ul>
<li>For example, the benefit plan may cover 12 visits to the chiropractor a year at a maximum of $100 per visit or a maximum benefit of $1,000 regardless of the number of visits.</li>

<ul>
<li>Co-payment is an integral part of most group plans in order to keep costs down.</li>
<li>There are two types of co-payment plans by plan members:<ul>
<li>Annual deductibles;</li>
<li>Co-insurance factors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The insurer will reimburse additional covered medical expenses only once the plan member pays the annual deductible.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 1</p>
<p>Clarissa is a member of a group plan that has an annual $100 deductible on dental benefits. Clarissa filed her first claim for the current year last month, an $80 bill for dental X-rays. She paid the bill herself and then submitted the bill to her group plan administrator, for the record. The group plan did not reimburse Clarissa anything, but her deductible for dental benefits for the current year was reduced to $20 ( $100 - $80).</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 2</p>
<p>Tomas is a member of the same group plan as Clarissa. His first dental claim of the year was $800 for a complicated extraction, requiring a general anaesthetic. Tomas submitted his claim but was not reimbursed for the first $100 of the claim, due to the deductible. The balance of $700 ( $800 - $100) qualified for reimbursement under the group plan.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>There are generally two types of annual deductibles when group extended health insurance covers both the plan members along with their families:<ul>
<li>An individual deductible;</li>
<li>A family deductible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The individual deductible is most often lower than the family deductible.</li>
<li>If a family member has filed claims that used up all of the individual deductible, no further deductible will be applicable to that person for the rest of the year.</li>
<li>Individual deductible claims from any family member will diminish the family deductible dollar-for-dollar.</li>
<li>Regardless of whether the individual uses their deductible or not—individual deductibles will no longer be applicable to any family members for the rest of the year once the family deductible has been depleted.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>John and Marsha are a married couple with one child, Colton. John is a member of a group extended health insurance plan that covers his whole family. For dental claims, the plan has a $100 individual deductible and a family deductible of $250.</p>
<p>In February of the current year, John filed a dental claim for $80. He received no reimbursement, but his individual deductible was reduced from $100 to $20 and the family deductible was reduced from $250 to $170.</p>
<p>In March, Marsha filed a dental claim for $120. Her individual deductible was reduced to $0 and the remaining family deductible was reduced from $170 to $70. $20 of the claim qualified for reimbursement.</p>
<p>In May, John filed another dental claim for $100. His remaining individual deductible was reduced from $20 to $0 and the remaining family deductible was reduced from $70 to $50. $80 of the claim qualified for reimbursement.</p>
<p>In July, a claim was filed for $70 of dental expenses for Colton. With a family deductible of $50 at that time, $20 of the claim for Colton qualified for reimbursement. The family deductible is now reduced to $0.</p>
<p>In September, an additional claim for $130 of dental expenses was filed for Colton. The entire $130 qualified for reimbursement, because the family deductible had already been reduced to $0.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The deductible is applicable annually—it restarts anew each year on the group contract’s anniversary date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The co-insurance factor is also applicable to some benefit claims.</p>
</li>
<li>The co-insurance factor applies against every claim once the deductible has been paid.</li>
<li>Co-insurance factors are most commonly applicable to dental benefits—which benefits are applicable varies between plans.</li>
<li>Both a deductible and co-insurance factor may be applicable when either only a few claims are filed by a plan member or claims are only filed early on in the year.</li>

<p>Kashif is a member of an employer’s group insurance plan that has a $100 annual deductible and an 80% co-insurance factor for dental claims. Last week Kashif went to the dentist and had two extractions and some other work done, costing $800. Kashif paid the $800 bill himself and submitted a claim for $800 to the group plan administrator, his first claim of the current year.
The first $100 was not reimbursed because of the plan’s $100 deductible (but the deductible was reduced to $0 for future claims for the current year). Of the remaining $700 of the claim, the group plan reimbursed Kashif $560, 80% under the co-insurance factor ( $700 × 80%). In total, the plan paid $560 of the $800 claim and Kashif paid $240 ( $800 – $560).</p>
