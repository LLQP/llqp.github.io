<h2 id="51-forms-of-business-ownership">5.1 Forms of Business Ownership<a class="headerlink" href="#51-forms-of-business-ownership" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The type of business structure an individual (or group of individuals) chooses for business has an effect on multiple issues such as:<ul>
<li>The simplicity and administrative costs of operating the business;</li>
<li>The tax rate on business profits; and</li>
<li>The amount of liabilities (including creditors) the business owner is exposed to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The following types of business structures as well as their advantages and disadvantages are examined in this chapter:<ul>
<li>Sole proprietorships;</li>
<li>Partnerships; and</li>
<li>Corporations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="511-sole-proprietorship">5.1.1 Sole proprietorship<a class="headerlink" href="#511-sole-proprietorship" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A sole proprietorship is the least formal structure for business ownership where there is one owner of an unincorporated business.</li>
<li>Sole proprietorships include many different types of businesses such as self-employed individulas, consultants, artists, independent tradesmen, etc.</li>
<li>In Canada, the majority of businesses are sole proprietorships. In some provinces, a modest fee is required to register a sole proprietorship.</li>
<li>Sole proprietorship advantages:<ul>
<li>Inexpensive to set up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Easy to set up and operate.</li>
<li>Sole proprietorship disadvantages:<ul>
<li>The financial affairs of a sole proprietorship and the personal financial affairs of the sole proprietor are indivisible (i.e., no legal differentiation between owner and business);</li>
<li>The net income of the proprietorship is the income of the proprietor (and is reported on the sole proprietor’s personal tax return);</li>
<li>Therefore, the business cannot be taxed at a lower rate; and</li>
<li>The sole proprietor’s assets are exposed to the business creditors of the proprietorship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="512-partnerships">5.1.2 Partnerships<a class="headerlink" href="#512-partnerships" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A partnership is composed of two or more individuals carrying on a business together with the primary goal of earning a profit.</li>
<li>Each partner has a partnership interest.</li>
<li>Partnership advantages:<ul>
<li>Partnership costs shared among partners;</li>
<li>Partners share revenues and expenses according to partnership agreements;</li>
<li>Net income is reported pro rata (in proportion) to the individual partners as stated in the partnership agreement; and</li>
<li>Income tax is not calculated at the partnership level - the net income is reported to the partners and taxed at each partner’s personal tax rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Partnership disadvantages:<ul>
<li>The financial affairs of a partnership and the personal financial affairs of the partnership owners are indivisible (i.e., no legal differentiation between owners and business);</li>
<li>Partners may be held jointly liable for debts and liabilities of the partnership. This means the actions of one partner can affect all partners even if they were not involved in creating the liability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="513-corporations">5.1.3 Corporations<a class="headerlink" href="#513-corporations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners who are shareholders.</li>
<li>Corporations are divided into two main categories—private and public.</li>
<li>The corporation itself carries on business through the efforts of its owner/operator(s) and employees.</li>
<li>Shares are created by a corporation. The individuals who receive or purchase those shares are the shareholders of the corporation. Shares correspond to pro-rata interest in the net value of the corporation. Control of the corporation is affected through shared voting rights.<ul>
<li>Corporations may be small, closely held businesses or large, multinational operations.</li>
<li>Corporations are taxed on their net income, often distributing their after-tax income to shareholders in the form of dividends, which are taxed in the hands of the business owner at substantially lower rates than salary or interest:<ul>
<li>Like policy dividends, stock dividends are not guaranteed; and</li>
<li>Shares have value and an adjusted cost base that can lead to a capital gain or loss when they are sold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shareholders are not responsible for corporate debt or liabilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5131-privately-held">5.1.3.1 Privately held<a class="headerlink" href="#5131-privately-held" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Shares of a private corporation are not publicly traded. Shares are issued to employees and others interested in the business who are generally the owners/operators of the business.</li>
<li>In Canada, the net income of a private operating company is taxed at a low tax rate.</li>
<li>Therefore, a privately held corporation is often established for tax benefit purposes and deferring tax on the company’s profits.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Willy operates a business that has net income of $200,000 a year, only $150,000 of which is needed to maintain Willy’s personal standard of living. He is in a 45% marginal tax bracket, which is the highest. If he operates a sole proprietorship, the “extra” $50,000 is subject to $22,500 of income tax ( $50,000 × 45%), leaving Willy with $27,500 ( $50,000 to $22,500) to invest. On the other hand, if Willy’s business was incorporated, the $50,000 of undistributed income would likely be taxed at about 15% in the corporation, leaving about $42,500, after-tax, ( $50,000 × (1 – 15%)) to be invested within the corporation. The extra $15,000 ( $42,500 – $27,500) accumulated after-tax annually would be subject to tax in Willy’s hands if it was ever withdrawn from the corporation, but affords Willy much more investment capital in the meantime.</p>

<h4 id="5132-publicly-held">5.1.3.2 Publicly held<a class="headerlink" href="#5132-publicly-held" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Shares of a public corporation are traded freely on a public stock exchange (such as the TSX).</li>
<li>Publicly held corporations frequently have tens or hundreds of thousands of shareholders.</li>
<li>Shareholders of public corporations are (for the most part) investors who seek to earn capital gains and dividends through share ownership.</li>

<li>Loss of a key employee to disability.</li>

<li>The owner of a business has to have the ability to generate an income and meet his creditor’s obligations—this is contingent on the owner’s ability to work and earn revenue.</li>
<li>A business owner who is unable to work due to disability risks:<ul>
<li>Loss of income with its corresponding impact on financial security and savings plans;</li>
<li>The inability to meet obligations to creditors, such as business suppliers.</li>

<p>The business owner will need to find a buyer prepared to pay the right price for his business in a timely fashion upon the onset of disability. Note that disability is often sudden and leaves little time for planning in advance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding a potential buyer, negotiating a price and quickly selling the business are all crucial since business revenues may decline and the value of the business will decrease if a disability drags on for a period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>The owner may have difficulty negotiating a fair price for the business from a position of weakness (that is, the owner’s need to sell).</li>
<li>Selling the business or an owner’s share of the business creates instability:<ul>
<li>Employees will be uncertain of their future;</li>
<li>Co-owners may be reluctant to take on a new owner and their methods and expectations;</li>

After allowing for fixed expenses of $4,000 a month, on average, and variable expenses of $2,000 a month, Tamirru’s gross take-home income is $9,000 a month. He has taken out personal disability income replacement insurance that would pay him $5,400 a month (60% of $9,000). That ensures Tamirru has funds to live on during a period of disability but provides no cash flow to maintain the ongoing expenses of the business. If Tamirru were disabled for any length of time, he might have to lay off his assistant and give up his studio and van.</p>

<li>If the full $144,000 of expenses was not claimed within the 24-month period, the policy benefit period would be open-ended, possibly continuing until such time as the entire $144,000 had been claimed.</li>
<li>In the example below, Todd’s benefits continue past the first 24 months because the benefit maximum for a business overhead expense insurance policy is not based on a time period but rather a dollar amount as a maximum.

And so on. On the other hand, if there were only $3,000 of qualifying expenses incurred in month three, $4,500 in benefits would be paid out for the month (the $3,000 incurred in month three plus the $1,500 in unclaimed expenses carried forward from the previous months).</p>

The $4,200 received by the business was treated as taxable income. On the other hand, the $4,200 of expenses paid is a tax-deductible expense.

<p>Although the work is not overly dangerous, there is always the risk of injury or illness that could interrupt Hideki’s ability to work and earn an income.

<p>Lawrence, Daryl and Darrin were three cousins, all in their early forties, who formed a partnership to operate a dental practice. The practice was very successful, with the cousins sharing office space and net profits from the practice, but each owning their own dental equipment. They had often talked about where they hoped the practice would go in the future and how they would look after each other’s families if something happened to one of them, but never took any specific action.</p>
<p>Darrin was severely injured in an automobile accident never to be able to return to work or manage his own affairs. His wife, Emily, became responsible for managing his assets, including his dental equipment and his share in the partnership. Lawrence and Daryl wished to acquire Darrin’s equipment, to be used by a young dentist they hoped to bring into the practice, and to buy out Darrin’s partnership interest. Unfortunately, the two dentists and Emily were unable to come to an agreement on price because the two remaining partners lacked the necessary cash on hand to buy Darrin’s interest outright. An installment purchase was finally worked out, which Lawrence and Daryl will be paying off for some years to come yet.</p>
<p>Even so, Emily would not relinquish ownership of Darrin’s dental equipment, hoping that her eldest son would be able to use it in his own dental office in a few short years.

<ul>
<li>The agreement addresses the many variables that will comprise a fair buyout for all parties to the buy-sell agreement.</li>
<li>These elements include the following.<ul>
<li>What has to happen for the buying and selling to occur?</li>
<li>This is the requirement for the disabled to satisfy the own occupation definition of disability.</li>
<li>Will the current owner be required to sell the business interest?</li>
<li>Who is required to buy the business interest?</li>
<li>When will the sale occur?</li>
<li>This establishes the waiting period before the benefit is paid.</li>
<li>What the price will be?</li>
<li>How will the buyer(s) pay?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Typically, the business buy-sell agreement provisions indicate that the agreement is effective in the event of the disability, critical illness, death or retirement of a current owner.</li>
<li>“Disability” is defined under the “own occupation” definition.</li>
<li>The buyout mandated under the agreement will not usually take effect until the business owner has been disabled for at least 12 months or longer, ensuring that the disabled owner will not recover and return back to the business.</li>
<li>The current owner and the owner’s estate, heirs or assignees are bound under the agreement to sell the business interest upon the occurrence of a specified event, giving the buyer the certainty that they will be able to buy the business.</li>
<li>However, the agreement also compels the buyer to buy the business interest, according to the terms of the agreement, once the covered event has occurred, giving the seller the certainty that the business is sold at a fair price.</li>
<li>Under a disability buy-sell the purchase and sale must take place within one year (at the very latest) of a current business owner becoming disabled.</li>
<li>It is important to establish the price of a business interest in advance. A buy-sell agreement should commit the buyer and the seller to a price that cannot be negotiated when the buy-sell is triggered.</li>
<li>The price is established in advance in the agreement as:</li>
<li><strong>A fixed price</strong>:<ul>
<li>The set price is determined under the agreement;</li>
<li>This price may or may not be indexed annually;</li>
<li>The least preferable method;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>May need adjustment over time as company fortunes rise or fall.</li>
<li><strong>A price formula</strong>:<ul>
<li>The parties agree on a formula to value business interest (e.g. a multiple of earnings);</li>
<li>This formula is indicated in the buy-sell agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>There are two basic types of buy-sell agreement.</li>
<li>An agreement may be structured as a “criss-cross” agreement in which each shareowner or partner buys disability buy-out insurance on all the other shareowners or partners. Each policyholder pays the policy premium and would receive policy proceeds when disability occurs.<ul>
<li>For example, the Best Company has three shareholders: Al, Bob and Carl. Al owns a policy naming Bob as insured and another policy naming Carl as insured. Bob owns a policy naming Al as insured and another naming Carl as insured. Carl owns a policy on each of Al and Bob.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An entity purchase or share redemption plan in which the business buys disability buyout insurance on its shareholders. The business pays the premiums and receives the insurance proceeds.<ul>
<li>For example, the Best Company has three shareholders: Al, Bob and Carl. The Best Company has a policy on each of Al, Bob, and Carl. If any of them become disabled according to the terms of the buy-sell agreement, the company receives the insurance proceeds.</li>

<li>A share redemption plan is taxed differently for partners than shareholders:<ul>
<li>A partner who sells his or her interest to the partnership will report a capital gain or loss in the year the sale is completed.</li>

<li>The disability buyout insurance accompanies the buy-sell agreement and provides the funding for the purchase of the business interest of the disabled.</li>
<li>The two should be initiated at the same time so that the features of both (waiting period, benefit amount, definition of total disability, structure of the payout, etc.) can be properly coordinated.</li>

<ul>
<li>The purpose of the buy/sell agreement and the DI policy used to fund it is to provide the capital required to buy out a business owner who is no longer able to perform withing the business. Therefore, the definition of total disability most frequently used as reference is the “own occupation” definition.</li>
<li>In certain cases, this definition applies to “own occupation and is not working” meaning the insured owner is unable to carry out his regular duties within the business and is not working in any other occupation within or outside the business.</li>

<li>For example, Roger becomes seriously ill and cannot perform the regular duties of his occupation. After 12 months, the buy-sell agreement compels his partner to pay for Roger’s interest in the company. The waiting period in a policy is based on the buy-sell agreement.

<p>Signs and Lines is an incorporated business with two co-owners and three full-time employees.

The two owners are involved primarily in management and promotion and the two other employees handle production, framing and delivery of goods.</p>
<p>Realizing that the business depends heavily on the services of Mona, the owners have taken out a key person disability policy on her life, with a 60-day waiting period and a 12-month benefit period, paying $12,500 a month.

<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Carly is a co-shareholder in an incorporated business with 30 employees. She has three co-owners. The company has key employee coverage on its owners, to ensure the viability of the business in the event of a prolonged disability. It also holds disability buyout policies on the lives of each, to fund a buy-sell agreement.</p>
<p>The buyout policies have a 12 month waiting period, so the firm has also taken out disability policies on the shareholders, paying a benefit equal to 50% of their net income, to help the owners maintain their lifestyle during the period between the onset of disability and the triggering of the buyout.</p>
<p>The contracts are owned and paid for by the corporation and are payable to it, which would, in turn, pay “salary continuation” to a disabled owner/operator. The plans have a 90-day waiting period and a nine-month benefit period.</p>
<p>Since the disability benefits paid to Carly would be taxable, the after-tax income would be insufficient to fully sustain her during a year of disability. She needs to consider taking out a personal DI policy to supplement the coverage provided by her company. Her personal policy might have a waiting period of as little as 30 days and a 12-month benefit period. The level of monthly benefit should be in the range of $10,000 a month for the first 60 days (when no income would be coming from the company plan) and $5,000 a month ( $60,000 a year) for the balance of the 10 months. If Carly was to remain disabled, long-term, coverage would not be necessary after 12 months, as her interest in the company would have been bought out under the insurance funded buy-sell agreement.</p>
