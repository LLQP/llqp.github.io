<ul>
<li>The following steps come after fact finding (as described in Chapter 6).</li>
<li>An agent has a duty of care to develop recommendations that are suitable to the client’s needs and to present the recommendations in a way that ensures the client understands the nature of the problems, and the solutions offered, so the client is able to make an informed decision.</li>
<li>An insurance recommendation is based on:<ul>
<li>The underlying reason that has been identified for insurance;</li>
<li>How premiums can be managed;</li>
<li>Whether there are modifications imposed for non-standard risks;</li>
<li>The quotes for the insurance documenting the recommendation;</li>
<li>A review of available policies;</li>
<li>Whether the recommendation requires revision based on client feedback;</li>
<li>The recommendation and all supporting information should be filed in the client’s documentation file—an important resource for answers in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="711-basis-for-the-recommendation">7.1.1 Basis for the recommendation<a class="headerlink" href="#711-basis-for-the-recommendation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Using the client profile, the agent identifies opportunities for an insurance recommendation.</li>
<li>Existing policies should be reviewed first to see whether changes could be made that will bring them in line with identified needs.</li>
<li>Failing that new policies are recommended.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="712-recommendations-to-manage-premiums">7.1.2 Recommendations to manage premiums<a class="headerlink" href="#712-recommendations-to-manage-premiums" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A&amp;S premiums are often higher than clients expect.</li>
<li>Creative thinking may be required to bring premium costs down in order to secure a client’s commitment to purchase.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="7121-extending-waiting-period-shortening-benefit-period-reduced-benefits">7.1.2.1 Extending waiting period, shortening benefit period, reduced benefits<a class="headerlink" href="#7121-extending-waiting-period-shortening-benefit-period-reduced-benefits" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The premium can be reduced by:<ul>
<li>A longer waiting period;</li>
<li>A shorter benefit period;</li>
<li>A lower benefit.</li>
<li>Insurance Recommendation, Contract and Service Needs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Care must be taken while increasing the waiting period or shortening the benefit period to ensure that the new extended waiting period will still allow the client to manage till the benefits begin, or that the shortened benefit period would meet the client’s needs considering the uncertainty of the duration of a disability or a need for care. Usually, the option of reducing benefit is a “last resort” solution.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="713-head-office-modifications-for-non-standard-risks">7.1.3 Head office modifications for non-standard risks<a class="headerlink" href="#713-head-office-modifications-for-non-standard-risks" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Risk of the insured will be classified by the underwriting process as:<ul>
<li>Standard;</li>
<li>Non-standard;</li>
<li>Uninsurable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-standard risks can become insurable if:</li>
<li>Exclusions are imposed;<ul>
<li>For example, a disability claim arising from skydiving will be excluded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limitations are imposed;<ul>
<li>For example, the benefit period of the policy is limited to five years instead of the 10 that was applied for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The premium is rated (that is, increased);</li>
<li>A deductible is applied to claims.<ul>
<li>For example, an extended health plan could be offered with an annual deductible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usually, the client gets to know of these specific changes to the policy as applied for when the policy is issued. The agent must explain these changes during the delivery of the policy.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="7131-suggesting-exclusions-limitations-and-ratings">7.1.3.1 Suggesting exclusions, limitations and ratings<a class="headerlink" href="#7131-suggesting-exclusions-limitations-and-ratings" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Exclusions and limitations are both elements that the insurance company might integrate into the contract being offered to the client to limit the insurer’s otherwise excess risk exposure with a non-standard life.</li>
<li>A rating is simply applying a premium to the contract that is higher than would be warranted if the applicant was rated “standard”.</li>
<li>The higher premium allows the insurer to build up a higher reserve—to help offset the higher risk of having to pay benefits.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="7132-suggesting-deductibles">7.1.3.2 Suggesting deductibles<a class="headerlink" href="#7132-suggesting-deductibles" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>An alternative, or complement, to modifying the benefits available under the plan is to require the insured to share in the cost of the covered treatments or benefits otherwise payable by imposing a deductible (i.e., an amount of the claim that must be paid by the insured before any benefits are forthcoming from the insurance company).</li>
<li>Deductibles would be most common in extended health plans: plans which would normally require the insurer to pay, or reimburse the insured for, covered goods or services.</li>
<li>Instead of being covered for the first dollar of claims, the insured is required to cover a dollar amount of the covered items himself, usually with a new deductible being applied each coverage year. In this way, the insurance company’s exposure to payouts is somewhat reduced.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Elvira’s group extended health insurance plan offers coverage of up to $2,500 a year for preventative and restorative dental services, after allowing for a $200 annual deductible per calendar year. Elvira’s first claim this year was $300, for X-rays, cleaning and one filling. She had to pay the first $200 herself, under the deductible and was reimbursed the additional $100. For any subsequent dental claims during the same calendar year, no deductible would apply.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="714-providing-quotes">7.1.4 Providing quotes<a class="headerlink" href="#714-providing-quotes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Quotes can be presented to the client for:<ul>
<li>A single “best choice” product solution: The agent researches the market and makes product comparisons in order to determine the best product solution in line with the client’s needs. He then presents this best option to the client based on his research. The agent should maintain a record of his research and the reasons behind his final decision. The recommendation, in this case, is final and the client decides whether to accept the recommendation or not.</li>
<li>Two suitable but different solutions: The client is involved in the decision-making process based on the agent’s preliminary research. The agent’s role will be to compare competing product similarities and differences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which route to take is a matter of personal choice of the agent but the agent who offers complimentary choices must prepare a clear comparison that highlights the main points of each policy. The agent should focus on the similarities and differences between the policies when making his comparison.</li>
<li>Trying to compare more than a few basic points may lead to the client not being able to make a decision.</li>
<li>The agent can help him make an informed decision between the policies being considered once the applicant has a clear understanding of the elements of each contract.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="715-documenting-the-recommendation">7.1.5 Documenting the recommendation<a class="headerlink" href="#715-documenting-the-recommendation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A client file should be opened from the very first contact between agent and client. All conversations and correspondence, both written and verbal, should be recorded in the file.</li>
<li>Research about competing products should also go into the file. This is evidence that the agent has carried out his or her due diligence.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="7151-rationale-for-recommendation">7.1.5.1 Rationale for recommendation<a class="headerlink" href="#7151-rationale-for-recommendation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Client expectations must be noted along with the rationale for the recommendation that was made and for those not made.</li>
<li>It may be essential at a future date to be reminded of the reasons a specific course of action was not taken.<ul>
<li>For example: “The reason we did not proceed with the critical illness policy was the client’s expressed desire not to buy the CI policy but to acquire more life insurance.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Agent Horst had to defend himself against a client complaint after another agent had reviewed the product that Horst had recommended, suggesting that Horst had not done due diligence in his research and therefore had not made the “best” recommendation for his client.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example  (Cont.)</p>
<p>In fact, Horst had compared five similar products that could meet his client’s needs and recommended the one that he felt was the best fit. Horst had wisely kept copies of his product research and a grid that he created to compare the products from a variety of perspectives. These documents proved invaluable in defending the fact that he did his due diligence and made a valid recommendation.</p>

<h4 id="7152-client-expectations">7.1.5.2 Client expectations<a class="headerlink" href="#7152-client-expectations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A client’s expectations about his or her insurability may not match with the underwriters’ assessment of the client’s insurability.</li>
<li>The opinions expressed by clients may lead to expectations about:<ul>
<li>The insurance product and coverage details they think is most suitable;</li>
<li>The risk they present;</li>
<li>The premium they deserve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The client file should document these expectations and how the agent took them into consideration.</li>
<li>If a policy is delivered that is significantly different than the client’s expectation, the agent may want the client to sign a waiver acknowledging the difference.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="716-presenting-complementary-policies">7.1.6 Presenting complementary policies<a class="headerlink" href="#716-presenting-complementary-policies" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Because insurance products address specific needs, it is quite possible for a client to require more than one type of policy. For example, a client may need a disability income policy plus a long-term-care policy.</li>
<li>If it is not possible to proceed with the recommendation for multiple policies, the most-pressing need should be addressed first.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Elijah owns a computer software consulting firm with three employees: two part-time employees and one full-time employee named Malik. Malik’s services are critical to the success of the business. If this key employee was to die or become disabled for a lengthy period of time, business revenues would suffer significantly, perhaps to the point where the business would have to be wound up. At the same time, Malik has a wife and two children who are wholly reliant on him for their financial support.</p>
<p>Elijah feels that the business could survive for at least 6 months without Malik’s contribution, but his family would be in serious financial straits after only 60 days. The business would need replacement cash flow of $10,000 a month for up to 2 years whereas the family would need $3,000 a month for at least 5 years if the disability lasted that long.</p>
<p>It would appear that one disability contract would not meet the needs of both the business and the family, so Elijah’s agent recommended that the company take out two policies: a key person disability contract for $10,000 a month with a 180-day waiting period, payable to Elijah’s company, and a disability policy for $3,000 a month with a 60-day waiting period, payable to Malik.</p>

<ul>
<li>If an initial recommendation is unsuitable, the agent must find ways to revise the recommendation to make it acceptable to the client, while ensuring that it meets the client’s coverage needs as closely as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="72-application-for-insurance">7.2 Application for Insurance<a class="headerlink" href="#72-application-for-insurance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The application is the first step in the process of creating an insurance contract.<ul>
<li>Contracts are subject to contract law and imply a set of rights and obligations on all parties to the contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A copy of the application should be placed in the documentation file.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="721-attention-to-detail-required">7.2.1 Attention to detail required<a class="headerlink" href="#721-attention-to-detail-required" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The application requires thorough and accurate answers to all questions, as underwriting of the application is generally based upon the answers provided.</li>
<li>The agent must ask the applicant all questions on the application form, and record the client’s answers completely and accurately.</li>
<li>Inaccurate or incomplete information on the application could result in a delayed underwriting process or coverage being declined.</li>
<li>From a practical and legal standpoint, the applicant and insured rely on the agent’s expertise in regard to the interpretation of the questions being asked on the application and an explanation of the nature of the answers expected.</li>
<li>How does the agent show the necessary attention to detail in the application?<ul>
<li>The agent correctly specifies the type of insurance and its coverage;</li>
<li>The agent ensures the correct parties (i.e., the policyholder, life insured, and beneficiary) are properly named under the policy;</li>
<li>The agent quotes a premium to the applicant and stresses that it is preliminary and will be finalized after underwriting;</li>
<li>The agent adds riders correctly according to the client’s wishes and informs the client that underwriting for riders is separate from the base policy, and rider premiums will be in addition to the premium for the base policy.</li>

<h4 id="7211-naming-of-beneficiary">7.2.1.1 Naming of beneficiary<a class="headerlink" href="#7211-naming-of-beneficiary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Most A&amp;S individual policies name the same person as the policyholder, life insured, and beneficiary.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Concerned about not burdening his children financially, Andre is applying for a long-term care policy on his own life, to cover nursing home fees and other medical costs should he need care in his elder years. Andre will be the owner, the life insured, and the beneficiary of the policy.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Business policies will be different. Often the business will be the policyholder. The life insured may be a shareholder, owner, or employee. The beneficiary may be the business, a shareholder, or an owner. Ensure the correct beneficiary information is stated so that premiums will be charged and benefits will be paid as the business expects. Ensuring the beneficiary information is correct is also important for tax reasons.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Hanif runs a privately incorporated business with three employees. He has struck different compensation arrangements with each employee and has taken out individual disability insurance policies on two of them, Alfred and Blanche, for different purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example  (Cont.)</p>
<p>The policy on Alfred is a key person plan, designed to compensate the business for the loss of his services should he become disabled for a period of time. Hanif’s business should be both the owner and the beneficiary of that policy. Neither the payment of premiums by the employer nor the payment of benefits (if any) to the employer would have a tax impact on the employee who is the life insured under the policy.</p>
<p>A second policy, on the life of Blanche, is intended to replace her personal income should she become disabled, thereby relieving the business of any obligation to continue Blanche’s salary even though she is not productive and contributing to business revenues. The business should be the owner of the policy. If Blanche is named as beneficiary of the policy, she should report the premiums that the business pays on the policy as a taxable employment benefit. Otherwise, the business could be named as beneficiary and use the policy benefits to replace the salary otherwise payable to a disabled Blanche. But in that case the entire benefit paid to Blanche would be taxable, not merely the premiums paid on the policy. Either outcome is acceptable, but Hanif and Blanche would need to know the tax consequences arising from the structure chosen.</p>

<ul>
<li>The agent should be proactive in the application process, asking for information that he knows the head office underwriting department may require, even it is not specifically requested on the application. The agent may choose to record his thoughts from the client interview.</li>
<li>Note that the agent may be the only the insurance company representative with whom the applicant has face-to-face contact, thus, the agent’s impressions and concerns are very important to the underwriting process.</li>
<li>The agent intervenes in the following aspects of the application:<ul>
<li>Agent’s comments;</li>
<li>Medical questions;</li>
<li>Inspection report; and</li>
<li>Hazardous sports and occupations questionnaires.</li>

<ul>
<li>Agents are provided with a comments section on the application for extra information that cannot be answered with yes/no responses.</li>
<li>Comments provided by the agent may be favourable or unfavourable to the applicant.<ul>
<li>For example, during the application process, the agent may notice that the client’s clothes smell like cigarette smoke but the client claims not to be a smoker, an agent should draw the insurer’s attention to it. Continuous exposure to second-hand smoke may have a lasting negative effect on a proposed insured’s health, which could also impact premiums.</li>
<li>It is essential for the agent to reveal any additional information that affects underwriting and acceptance or denial of the application.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="7222-medical-questions">7.2.2.2 Medical questions<a class="headerlink" href="#7222-medical-questions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The agent assists the applicant with the completion of the “non-medical” form: a questionnaire that requires the applicant to respond to a series of questions about his and his family’s health history, either in lieu of or as a precursor to undergoing a medical examination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medical questions can prompt the agent to ask for extra details.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, a medical check-up could be scheduled (i.e., routine) or unscheduled (i.e., due to a medical problem) and could result in tests, medical procedures, drugs or therapy. Simply knowing there was a medical check-up does not provide the full and accurate picture of the reasons for the check-up and its outcome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>A question on the non-medical form on an application asks, “When was the last time you visited a doctor, and what was the reason for the visit?” The applicant, who was also to be the life insured under the policy, answered,</p>
<p>“Last July, for a check-up.” The agent recorded the applicant’s answer and moved on to the next question. However, this left a number of unanswered questions in the mind of the head office underwriter:</p>
<p>Was this an annual or semi-annual scheduled check-up or was there a specific problem that triggered the visit to the doctor?</p>
<ul>
<li>If the latter, what was the specific problem?</li>
<li>What were the symptoms, if any?</li>
<li>What did the doctor conclude?</li>
<li>Were you subsequently sent for tests? If so, which tests? What feedback did you or your doctor receive?</li>
<li>Was any medical procedure required?</li>
<li>Were any drugs or therapies prescribed?</li>
<li>What was the result of the treatment, if any?</li>
</ul>
<p>An answer simply recording the date of the applicant’s last doctor visit might have satisfied the needs of the question, in its simplest form, but would not have satisfied the underwriters.</p>

<h4 id="7311-morbidity-rates">7.3.1.1 Morbidity rates<a class="headerlink" href="#7311-morbidity-rates" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Morbidity is the instance of disability—injury or illness—in the population at large.</li>
<li>The morbidity rate is the likelihood that a person, according to age, gender, occupation or some other factor, will suffer from a disease, illness, injury, or sickness.<ul>
<li>The mortality rate, in contrast to the morbidity rate, is the rate of death.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As noted, morbidity tables are used by actuaries to estimate future claims as accurately possible. Actual numbers of claimants may vary – greater or less than estimated – with the potential variance becoming more severe if the mix of lives insured by the insurance company varies significantly from the mix of lives in the population as a whole.</li>
<li>The tables only show the number of past claims, their causes and their duration: not the dollar amount of exposure per claim.</li>
<li>Some insurers are more successful estimating morbidity rates than others, and consequently, their premiums reflect their accuracy. This may mean their premiums are higher or lower than competitors.</li>

<h4 id="7312-ratings-and-exclusions">7.3.1.2 Ratings and exclusions<a class="headerlink" href="#7312-ratings-and-exclusions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>As noted previously, ratings and exclusions are a way for the insurance company to manage the risk of a claim.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="732-financial-underwriting">7.3.2 Financial underwriting<a class="headerlink" href="#732-financial-underwriting" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Coverage that insurers will issue is restricted to a percentage of pre-disability income from all sources and is coordinated with benefits available from all other sources.</li>
<li>The applicant must be a good candidate for premium payments after issue and into the future. This requires verification of the applicant’s income and expenses.</li>
<li>The life insurance company can lose money on a policy that is issued and lapses within several years.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="733-medical-underwriting">7.3.3 Medical underwriting<a class="headerlink" href="#733-medical-underwriting" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When medically underwriting a client and assessing the risk of whether to insure a given applicant, insurance companies evaluate the health of an applicant through:<ul>
<li>Performing a medical examination by a doctor or a paramedical professional; and</li>
<li>Often (but not automatically) asking for supplementary reports from the applicant’s personal physician as well as input from the Medical Information Bureau (MIB).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>An Attending Physician’s Statement (APS) is a report from the applicant’s doctor, outlining details of a condition or treatment incurred in the past.</li>
<li>The personal physician of the life insured provides the APS.</li>
<li>It is requested by the underwriter, and the insurance company pays for the statement.</li>
<li>The need for an APS is determined by:<ul>
<li>The applicant’s age;</li>
<li>The policy coverage;</li>
<li>Medical history of the applicant or their family.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additionally, the insurer may request additional information or tests, such as a medical exam by a paramedic or physician, blood or urine tests, or an electrocardiogram.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="7332-medical-information-bureau-mib">7.3.3.2 Medical Information Bureau (MIB)<a class="headerlink" href="#7332-medical-information-bureau-mib" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Medical Information Bureau (MIB) is an organization serving the life and health insurance industry by compiling historical data on lives insured and those applying for insurance.</li>
<li>The insurer reports coded information to the MIB when an individual applies for insurance and also seeks such coded information currently on file with the MIB.</li>
<li>An applicant must give permission for their information to be shared with the MIB.</li>
<li>The information shared with the MIB provides general “markers” that indicate a possible health problem and could trigger the insurer to seek additional input from medical professionals.</li>
<li>The MIB may also collect information about coverage currently in force, or currently being applied for, and instances where coverage was declined on an applicant.</li>
<li>With this information, insurance companies can protect themselves against applicants seeking:<ul>
<li>To “over-insure” themselves;</li>
<li>To obtain coverage to which they are not entitled (due to medical conditions not disclosed to the insurer).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This prevents applicants who have been turned down or rated by one insurance company from applying to a second insurer without disclosing either the decline/rating or the reason for it.</li>
<li>MIB data can lead to an underwriter requesting substantiating information from a doctor or other sources; the data itself cannot be the reason to deny a claim or apply a higher (rated) premium.</li>

<ul>
<li>The issue of the contract by the insurance company to the applicant is the second step in the process of preparing a contract:<ul>
<li>The policy is an “offer” that requires acceptance by the applicant;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The contract is completed when the policy is accepted and the policy premium is paid;</li>
<li>The contract is the basis for all transactions between the policyholder and the insurance company.</li>

<ul>
<li>It may take many weeks for the policy to be underwritten and issued by the insurance company.</li>
<li>Once issued, the agent is expected to promptly deliver the contract in person to the applicant.</li>
<li>From the day of delivery, the policyholder has 10 days in which to review the policy and decide whether to keep it.</li>
<li>If it is returned—or rescinded—by the policyholder, they will receive a full refund of their premium paid.</li>
<li>If the insured receives her policy on Friday, June 10, she has until Friday, June 24 to return or rescind her policy because the weekends are not considered working days.</li>

<ul>
<li>The provincial insurance acts have specific requirements that must be met before a contract of life or A&amp;S insurance is legally in force, such as the following:<ul>
<li>The insurance contract is delivered to the policyholder;</li>
<li>The initial premium payment is made; and</li>
<li>That no changes to the financial situation of the insured and the health of the life insured between application and delivery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The agent must ask the insured if there has been a change before handing over the policy.<ul>
<li>If the answer is “yes” the policy must not be delivered. The change should be noted on the contract, and the contract must then be returned to the insurance company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Agent Todd was delivering a newly issued critical illness policy to Lucille. In response to questions asked by Todd in the delivery interview, Lucille acknowledged that she had experienced chest pains, diagnosed as angina, starting about two weeks after she had submitted her application for insurance. Rather than deliver the contract to Lucille, Todd took particulars of Lucille’s change in health (dates, the diagnosis, name of the doctor involved, etc.) and forwarded a copy of his notes, with his report and the contract, to the insurance company for a reassessment.</p>

<ul>
<li>A rated policy (i.e., increased premiums, exclusions, reduced benefits, etc.) will likely not meet the applicant’s expectations. This disappointment can lead to the policy being rescinded.</li>
<li>To avoid rescission, the agent should:<ul>
<li>Mention the possibility of a rating if medical or other issues arise during the application process;</li>
<li>Point out when the rating is temporary and can be eliminated when circumstances improve;</li>
<li>Point out gently that the rationale for applying for the coverage has not changed and indirectly imply that the need for coverage is now greater since additional risk factors have been found.</li>

<li>Benefits;</li>
<li>Riders;</li>
<li>Key definitions of covered coverage (particularly in regard to CI insurance);</li>

<p>Jorge has disability insurance coverage through his group plan at work that will pay him benefits of up to $2,500 a month (50% of salary) for up to 2 years after a 30-day waiting period. If he wants more comprehensive coverage than that, he could, for example, take out an individual policy that would top up his coverage by another $500 a month (totalling 60% of salary) for 2 years and then increase to $3,000 a month for an additional 3 years. This would give him $3,000 a month of coverage for the full 5 years through the 2 plans combined. He could not, however, collect more than $3,000 a month from the 2 policies combined.</p>

<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Two years ago Consuela purchased $2,500 a month of disability insurance coverage. The coverage was based on her income of $90,000 a year. At the time, she could have qualified for up to $4,500 a month of benefits, but some extraordinary personal expenses limited the funds that she had available for insurance. The policy she purchased has a future purchase option for up to $500 a month of additional coverage, without medical underwriting, provided she qualifies financially for the additional coverage. The first option to increase coverage comes up later this month. Consuela met with her agent and confirmed that she would like the extra coverage; in fact, her cash flow would permit her to afford $4,000 a month of insurance benefit now. Consequently, she agreed to exercise the $500 option and to apply for an additional $1,000 of coverage with full underwriting.</p>

<ul>
<li>The claims process is a very important part of the application process to the policyholder.</li>
<li>The claim’s timing and content by the insured will be crucial to its success and credibility.</li>
<li>It is very important for clients to ensure that all the information they write down on the claim form is complete, accurate and entirely truthful. Note that careless or false statements could lead to the insurer carrying out a lengthy adjudication process.</li>
<li>During the claims process and when assisting the client (for example, when helping the client fill out his claims form), it is important for the agent not to put himself in the position of a conflict of interest—as a representative of both the insurer and the insured.<ul>
<li>The agent should be careful to follow the carrier’s procedures if he assists the clients in the claims process, particularly when helping the client with the completion of his claims form. This is a delicate legal matter.</li>

<li>How is a claim made?<ul>
<li>The insurance company is notified of the injury, illness, or diagnosis as soon as possible following the event.</li>
<li>The claims form is delivered to the disabled client by the agent or by mail.</li>
<li>The claims form is completed by the disabled client. It is sent to the insurance company with original receipts or other supporting information.</li>
<li>The insurance company seeks additional information, such as an attending physician’s statement, about the medical condition causing the claim.</li>
<li>The insurance company pays the claim in full or part or denies the claim.</li>
<li>Standard contract limitations will apply and cause the claim to be denied, for instance if the injury is self-inflicted.</li>
<li>Material misrepresentation on the application will result in the claim being denied.</li>
<li>The income of the insured could reduce the claim if they earn less at the time of disability than when the application was made.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If benefits being applied for require reimbursement for medical or other services already rendered (such as dental work, chiropractic care, prescription drugs, etc.), the insurance company will want original copies of receipts for the expenditures, in order to verify both the amount and appropriateness of the claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These receipts should be forwarded by the claimant to the insurance company along with the appropriate claims form.</p>

<ul>
<li>All types of accident and sickness contracts require the occurrence of some medical event prior to the payment of benefits. For instance:<ul>
<li>Disability policies require an inability to work and earn an income due to injury or illness;</li>
<li>Critical illness policies require that the life insured suffer a covered condition or medical event (heart attack, stroke, etc.) triggering a claim;</li>
<li>Long-term care policies pay benefits based on covered expenses for an insured unable to fulfill at least two of the activities of daily living (ADLs);</li>
<li>Business overhead expense contracts require an inability to work and contribute to the business’s productivity on the part of the life insured, due to injury or illness; and</li>
<li>Extended health policies may require an assessment of medical treatment (such as extensive restorative or cosmetic dental procedures) before expenditures are authorized for reimbursement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The insurer will not, of course, simply take the insured’s word for the fact that he is suffering a disability, etc., it is going to want supporting medical evidence for the diagnosis. This will, at a minimum, require a report from the attending physician regarding the nature, degree and prognosis of the event that triggered the claim. In some cases, the insurer may also request additional tests or a physical examination by a physician of their choice, to verify the condition.</li>
<li>In addition, particularly in the case of disability, the insurance company may also want ongoing proof of treatment to rectify the situation. This again would require reports from the physician or other practitioner (chiropractor, physiotherapist, etc.) treating the claimant.</li>

<ul>
<li>It may be that, at the time of the claim, the client receives benefits less than the maximum provided for under the contract, or no benefits at all. It is important that the agent assists the client to understand any such discrepancies.</li>
<li>Possible reasons for a modification of benefits payable would include situations related to standard contract limitations seen in previous chapters (such as suicide, alcohol or drug abuse, criminal activity, etc.). Similarly, all contracts provide that benefits are not payable if it is determined that the applicant made a material misrepresentation at the time of application.</li>
<li>Furthermore, in cases where financial underwriting is required to determine the amount of benefits payable, reduced benefits may result from a change in the insured’s financial situation. For example, disability benefits could be reduced if the insured’s income at time of claim is less than was reported at the time of application.</li>
