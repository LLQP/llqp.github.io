<ul>
<li>Insurance agents need to be familiar with the legal aspects of insurance.</li>
<li>Insurance law in Canada stems from three primary sources:<ul>
<li>Canadian Constitution – takes precedence over everything else;</li>
<li>Common Law – originates from England;</li>
<li>Legislation and regulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Canadian Constitution takes precedence over all other sources of law. All laws created, provincial and federal, must comply with the Constitution.</li>
<li>Under the Constitution Act, 1867, the Constitution distributed legislative powers to create laws between the federal and provincial levels of government.</li>
<li>Insurance law is considered to be an exclusive provincial matter under the Canadian Constitution.</li>
<li>Common Law is law developed by judges based on the decisions of courts and similar tribunals (case law). Whereas, statute law is a civil law system based on laws adopted through the legislative process or regulation issued by the executive branch of government.</li>
<li>Common Law is applicable everywhere in Canada except for Québec where civil law based on the Civil Code of Québec has jurisdiction.</li>
<li>The principles relating to contract, torts, property, trusts and agencies are governed by Common Law.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The Insurance Act defines an insurance contract as:<ul>
<li>“The undertaking by one person to indemnify another person against loss or liability for loss in respect of a certain risk or peril to which the object of the insurance may be exposed, or to pay a sum of money or other thing of value upon the happening of a certain event, and includes life insurance.”</li>

<h3 id="114-agency-relationship">1.1.4 Agency relationship<a class="headerlink" href="#114-agency-relationship" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An agency relationship exists when a “principal” designates authority to an “agent.” This relationship of delegated authority is called “agency.”</li>
<li>In all provinces and territories (except Québec), the relationship between a life insurance company (principal) and a life insurance agent (who sells that company’s policies) is an agency relationship.</li>
<li>The agent acts on behalf of the insurance company (principal) by selling its insurance products.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="115-agents">1.1.5 Agents<a class="headerlink" href="#115-agents" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Insurance agents are either employed by individual insurers or are independent representatives of specific insurance companies contracted to sell that company’s products to clients.</li>
<li>The terms and limitations of the agent’s authority are outlined in the written contract each agent signs with each company he represents.</li>
<li>Insurance agents fall into one of two categories:<ul>
<li>Independent agent:<ul>
<li>Can represent a specific insurance company to sell that company’s products to clients or can sell insurance policies from multiple insurance companies;</li>
<li>Agents process their business through a managing general agent (MGA);</li>
<li>MGA reviews the agent’s insurance applications and submits to the insurer on behalf of the agent;</li>
<li>The insurance company pays the MGA, who then pays the agent a commission according to the terms of their contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Captive agent:<ul>
<li>Sells insurance products from a single company or bound by contractual stipulations or employment arrangements to represent a single MGA or insurance marketing entity;</li>
<li>Is an employee of a specific insurance company and only sells that company’s products;</li>
<li>May be a self-employed worker having concluded a distribution agreement with an insurer or an insurer’s affiliate (with an exclusivity clause)</li>
</ul>

<li>Is either a partnership or a corporation;</li>
<li>Holds a licence from the regulator(s);</li>
<li>Must have at least one licensed insurance agent for the category for which the insurance agency holds a licence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Agents who want to expand their business by hiring, training and supervising other agents must apply for a corporate agency life licence and meet the requirements of the specific province where they intend to operate.</li>
<li>Whether it is a partnership or corporation, a life insurance licence is required for any employee (or individual) who:<ul>
<li>Solicits insurance;</li>
<li>Obtains or takes an application for insurance;</li>
<li>Negotiates for or procures insurance;</li>

<h2 id="12-general-legal-principles-applicable-to-a-life-insurance-agent">1.2 General Legal Principles Applicable to a Life Insurance Agent<a class="headerlink" href="#12-general-legal-principles-applicable-to-a-life-insurance-agent" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>While each province has its own legislation, insurance legislation is very similar across all the provinces and territories (except Québec) as they were formed based on a model statute created in the 1920s in cooperation with the “Uniform Law Conference.”</li>
<li>The law that applies to the interpretation of an insurance contract will be the law of the province or territory where the policy was contracted.</li>
<li>These legal principles that govern insurance arise from Common Law or statutory law (statutes) and are addressed in the sections that follow:<ul>
<li>Capacity and status of persons;</li>
<li>Natural persons, partnerships and legal persons (corporations);</li>
<li>Minors and guardians;</li>
<li>Power of attorney (POA)</li>
<li>Marriage and common law unions;</li>
<li>Divorce and separation;</li>
<li>Wills, estates and successions;</li>
<li>Trusts and trustees;</li>
<li>Bankruptcy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="121-capacity-and-status-of-persons">1.2.1 Capacity and status of persons<a class="headerlink" href="#121-capacity-and-status-of-persons" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The law requires that anyone, of any age, who is seeking to enter into any contract, must have “legal capacity.”</li>
<li>Capacity means:<ul>
<li>A person’s ability to provide valid consent; and that</li>
<li>The individual is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and that they are entering into a binding agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The following excerpt from the Substitute Decisions Act (Ontario) illustrates the legal definition presumed for “legal capacity”:<ul>
<li>A person who is eighteen years of age or more is presumed to be capable of entering into a contract;</li>
<li>A person who is sixteen years of age or more is presumed to be capable of giving or refusing consent in connection with his or her own personal care.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Individuals who are mentally incapable lack the legal capacity to give valid consent, and therefore lack the legal capacity to enter into an insurance contract.</li>
<li>There is no recognized maximum age at which a person is presumed to be incapable of giving valid consent age.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="122-natural-persons-individuals-partnerships-and-legal-persons-corporations">1.2.2 Natural persons (individuals), partnerships and legal persons (corporations)<a class="headerlink" href="#122-natural-persons-individuals-partnerships-and-legal-persons-corporations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A “natural person” is defined as a human being.</li>
<li>A “partnership” is an arrangement between two or more parties carrying on business together for the purpose of making a profit.</li>
<li>In a partnership, all partners can sign a contract on behalf of the partnership and each partner is financially responsible for the contracts entered into by the partnership.</li>
<li>A “legal person” is defined as a corporation – it is a separate legal entity distinctly separate from those who manage it or own it.</li>
<li>Corporations have most of the property rights of individuals, and can enter into contracts, and buy, sell, and own all kinds of property.</li>
<li>Business corporations are owned by shareholders. Shareholders can be individuals, other corporations or partnerships.</li>
<li>According to the federal or provincial laws under which they are established, corporations are governed by a board of directors elected by the shareholders.</li>
<li>Usually the executive officers, such as the president or secretary, are authorized (by a corporate bylaw or a resolution of the board of directors) to represent the company in specific transactions or activities.</li>
<li>Insurance applications require the signatures of two signing officers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="123-minors-and-guardians">1.2.3 Minors and guardians<a class="headerlink" href="#123-minors-and-guardians" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A “minor” is defined as a person under the “age of majority.”</li>
<li>The age of majority varies from one province or territory to another. It is the age of 18 in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Québec, and Saskatchewan and the age of 19 in British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and the Yukon.</li>
<li>Provincial insurance legislation says that to purchase an insurance policy, a person of 16 years of age or older has the capacity to enter into a contract for insurance on his or her own behalf.</li>
<li>Parents of minors aged 15 and under have an “insurable interest” in their children – meaning that they may apply for and be the policyholder of a life insurance policy that will pay a death benefit upon the death of their children.</li>
<li>Guardians for minor children may be appointed by:<ul>
<li>The child’s parents;</li>
<li>A court having jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Court-appointed guardians are important in insurance practice for two main reasons:<ul>
<li>If an insurance death benefit is payable to a minor, the minor’s guardian may be entitled to accept the payment from the insurance company;</li>
<li>In applying for insurance on behalf of a minor, the guardian will be answering questions, completing the application and providing consent for the release of medical information on behalf of the minor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there is no person capable of giving (and authorized to give), a valid discharge to the insurer for the insurance money, the insurer shall, within 30 days after receiving the evidence required, pay the money and any applicable interest into court to the credit of the minor. When paid to the court, the money will be managed by the Public Guardian and Trustee, if there is no trustee, or court-appointed guardian to receive it.</li>

<ul>
<li>Adults may voluntarily appoint a legal representative (while they are still capable of doing so) to represent them and make decisions on their behalf when they are coming to their end of their life or in the case they become incapable. This is referred to as appointing a power of attorney. There are two types of powers of attorney:<ul>
<li>Power of attorney:<ul>
<li>A legal document made by one person who appoints a person called an “attorney,” to deal with the business and property of another person and to make financial and legal decisions on that person’s behalf;</li>
<li>A power of attorney ends if the person who gave the power of attorney becomes mentally incapable of making decisions.</li>
<li>The attorney is also called the “agent,” and the person appointing the attorney is called the “principal.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enduring power of attorney:<ul>
<li>A legal document made by one person (the principal) who appoints another person (the attorney or agent) to make financial and legal decisions for the principal. However, an enduring power of attorney will continue even if the principal becomes mentally incapable of making decisions.</li>
<li>To create an enduring power of attorney, the document must be properly signed, and must state:<ul>
<li>Whether the attorney (the person appointed to make decisions) can act while the person is capable or only while the person is incapable;</li>
<li>That the attorney’s authority continues despite the incapability of the person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Depending on the terms of the document, a property power of attorney may come into effect immediately; or it may require someone, such as a doctor, to “trigger” its effect by determining that the person who has granted the power of attorney has become incapable of managing his/her own affairs.</li>
<li>The Power of Attorneys Act states that an attorney has the power to deal with the owner’s property but not to make a will on their behalf.</li>
<li>A beneficiary designation made by an attorney will be refused by most insurers unless a court order states otherwise or, in the case of an annuity contract, when a transfer of money takes place, in the presence of an existing beneficiary designation, from another financial institution made with the former financial institution. Otherwise, the attorney would be able to revoke a beneficiary designation made by the principal by transferring monies from one financial institution to another.</li>
<li>Before accepting the instructions given by a power of attorney, insurance agents should obtain a certified true copy of the power of attorney document from a notary public, and then have it reviewed by the insurance company involved.</li>
<li>If asked to do so, agents should not act as a power of attorney for a client. This arrangement is not covered by professional errors and omissions insurance, and could put the insurance agent in a conflict of interest with the client and, potentially, in trouble with the insurance regulator.</li>
<li>If an adult becomes incapable and has not appointed a personal representative, in order to manage that individual’s affairs, a court may appoint:<ul>
<li>A guardian; or</li>
<li>A trust company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trust companies can manage an incapable individual’s financial affairs but not their personal care aspects.</li>
<li>Court-appointed guardians:<ul>
<li>Are subject to the terms of the court;</li>
<li>Are able to transact insurance business on existing policies on the behalf of the incapable adult individual;</li>
<li>Are required to propose a property management plan for the incapable adult individual that is then subject to review from the court;</li>
<li>Differ from a power of attorney in that guardianship only comes into effect after a person has been declared incapable;</li>
<li>Cannot come into effect while a person is still mentally capable whereas a power of attorney can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A power of attorney for personal care (a “living will”) is a legal document in which a specific person is named to act on an individual’s behalf with respect to medical treatment and personal care needs. A living will:<ul>
<li>Simply addresses a person’s treatment and personal care wishes;</li>
<li>Does not necessarily designate authority to anyone else;</li>
<li>Does not need to be written in any specific way.</li>

<li>The rights of common law and married couples differ significantly upon relationship breakdown:<ul>
<li>In most provinces and territories, common-law partners can acquire the right to seek spousal support.</li>
<li>However, common-law partners do not have rights to property division;</li>
<li>Married couples have the right to spousal support and property division;</li>
<li>Marriage is a formal legal status that is acquired and terminated under federal law. The legally recognized state of marriage immediately has significant effects on property ownership and civil rights that are subject to provincial and territorial law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Canada, any two persons may become married, but individuals may only be legally married to one spouse at a time.</li>
<li>Married status is retained until the death of a spouse, the annulment of the marriage or until a legally valid divorce is granted by court order. As such, separation does not legally end a marriage.</li>
<li>Marriage creates both legal rights and obligations, which couples may amend or adjust through domestic or marriage contracts (i.e., prenuptial agreement).</li>
<li>Common law couples can also enter into a domestic contract, sometimes called a “cohabitation agreement.” This is strongly advised to protect individuals living in common law arrangements as cohabitation agreements often deal with property division on relationship breakdown and succession rights upon death.</li>

<li>Grounds for divorce are governed by the Divorce Act and the right to spousal and/or child support payments on divorce also arises under the Act.</li>
<li>An annulment ends a marriage but has a different meaning - the marriage is legally treated as never having been in effect. However it has the same legal effect as divorce - the marriage is dissolved and the divorced or unmarried persons are free to remarry.</li>
<li>The effect of a divorce or separation on insurance needs analysis and beneficiary designation planning is an increasingly complex and important part of insurance law.</li>

<li>Property that was acquired prior to the relationship, or that came from an inheritance during the marriage, usually gets protection from division.</li>

<ul>
<li>“Succession law” refers to the body of provincial law that deals with deceased persons’ estates and the rules governing what happens to their property after death.</li>
<li>An “estate” is the collection of property and property rights that a deceased person owned.</li>
<li>The person appointed to be in charge of someone’s estate is known the executor (male) or executrix (female) or estate trustee (gender neutral). This appointment is made in one’s will. If there is no will, or no willing and able executor, someone must apply to the court to be put in charge of the estate. This person will be recognized as an administrator or estate trustee.</li>
<li>The executor:<ul>
<li>Must pay the debts and taxes owing of the deceased;</li>
<li>Must manage and distribute the remaining assets according to the terms of the will of the deceased person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a person dies, not all property owned by that individual is controlled by their will:<ul>
<li>Property held in “joint tenancy” with one or more persons usually passes outside the will where the surviving joint tenant assumes full ownership of the property;</li>
<li>Registered plans with a named beneficiary, including registered retirement savings plans (RRSP), registered retirement income funds (RRIF), and tax-free savings plans (TFSA), pass directly to the named beneficiary;</li>
<li>Life insurance payable to a named beneficiary also passes outside the will and goes directly to the named beneficiary. However, when “estate” is listed as the beneficiary on a life insurance policy, the proceeds are distributed under the terms of the will;</li>
<li>Financially dependent persons, such as a surviving spouse or children, can sue the estate for support if the deceased person owed them a duty of support and failed to make “adequate” provision in their will.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The prior rights of financial dependants and spouses allow them to be adequately provided for even though they may receive life insurance as a named beneficiary. Such insurance may be considered part of the estate and made subject to an order for the support of dependants.</li>
<li>Surviving spouses under pension law also obtain rights that have priority over designated beneficiaries, legatees and heirs, which are also received outside the will or the estate.</li>

<ul>
<li>A person may or may not have a valid will when they die:<ul>
<li>“Testate” is when someone dies and they have a valid will;</li>
<li>“Intestate” is when someone dies without a valid will.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Separation of married partners has no effect on a will and signing a separation agreement may allow alimony claims to be made against the other spouse’s estate, but it does not usually affect voluntary gifts made by will or the designation of beneficiaries.</li>
<li>If clients wish to disinherit a former legal former spouse (marriage) after separation, they need to change their will and their beneficiary designations, and need to sign a separation agreement</li>
<li>Divorce does not affect the validity of a will. However, it is treated as though the former spouse predeceased the testator (only the provisions in the will that refer to the spouse are revoked). Likewise, a divorce does not revoke the designated beneficiaries, except in Québec.</li>
<li>A will made before marriage is automatically revoked upon marriage, unless the will was made with the marriage in mind (with a statement making reference to the upcoming marriage and the name of the spouse)</li>
<li>Where there is a will, the executor will distribute the estate according to the terms of the will.</li>
<li>Where there is no will, the estate administrator will distribute the estate in accordance with the applicable provincial rules of intestacy.</li>
<li>If a policyholder’s beneficiary designations contained in a will are revoked, and there is no valid beneficiary designation, the insurance or registered plan proceeds will become payable to the policyholder’s estate. When the policyholder dies without a will, the estate will be distributed according to the provincial law that determines who inherits on intestacy.</li>

<ul>
<li>A trust is established when one party (the settlor) gives another party (the trustee) property to hold for the benefits of a third party (the beneficiaries).</li>
<li>Therefore, three parties are required to be part of a trust:<ul>
<li>Settlor—the person who created the trust and from whom the assets come;</li>
<li>Trustee—A “trustee” has legal title (as opposed to equitable title or beneficial ownership) to the property given to them “in trust” and in under legal obligation to act when the need arises; and</li>
<li>Beneficiary—the person who benefits from the trust.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are two main types of trusts:<ul>
<li>Inter vivos trust – established during a person’s lifetime; and</li>
<li>Testamentary trust – established upon death in the deceased person’s will.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Insurance proceeds can be used to create a trust fund or contributed to an existing trust fund.</li>
<li>This is not the case for guardians and powers of attorney – they have certain powers over a person’s property, but they do not take title to the property.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Rob gives money to his lawyer, to be used towards Rob’s purchase of a house. The money is put into the lawyer’s trust account, so only he has control over it, and it is in his name. But there is no doubt in anyone’s mind about who the money belongs to, or what it is to be used for. If the lawyer dies, or goes bankrupt, the trust money is unaffected, because it does not belong beneficially to the lawyer.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Trustees can own any type of property that individuals can, so they can also hold an insurance policy, pay the premiums (from trust monies) as long as necessary, and then either transfer ownership of the policy to the beneficiary, or collect and handle the proceeds of the insurance in accordance with the terms of the trust.</li>

<h3 id="129-bankruptcy">1.2.9 Bankruptcy<a class="headerlink" href="#129-bankruptcy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>“Insolvent” means that a person is unable to meet their financial obligations as they come due (rent, bills, loan payments, mortgage, etc.). Note that a person may still have assets and income and be insolvent.</li>
<li>When a person is unable to pay their debts, they may decide to make a formal declaration of bankruptcy, or they may be legally declared bankrupt. Either case leads to the appointment of a bankruptcy trustee.</li>
<li>The trustee in bankruptcy collects the available assets of the bankrupt person and uses them to the benefit of the bankrupt’s creditors according to the rules in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.</li>
<li>It is also possible for an estate to be bankrupt, in which case the beneficiaries inherit nothing.</li>
<li>Life insurance, or financial products that qualify as life insurance, including life annuities and segregated funds, may qualify for special protection against creditors in the event of an insolvency or bankruptcy of the policyholder.</li>
<li>Naming an irrevocable beneficiary designation provides an opportunity to create creditor protection, even for beneficiaries outside the protected family class. In such situations, the policy itself (which could have substantial cash values) is not subject to seizure and cancellation by execution creditors.</li>
<li>While a designation in favour of a spouse, child, grandchild or parent of a person whose life is insured, or any of them, is in effect, the insurance money and the rights and interests of the insured therein and in the contract are exempt from execution or seizure.</li>
<li>Pension funds (including LIRA, LIF and annuities purchased with pension fund money) are also generally exempted from seizures. In some jurisdictions, registered products, such as RRSP and RRIF, are exempt from seizure, even without beneficiary designation, and even if issued by financial institutions other than life insurance companies.</li>
<li>In every Canadian jurisdiction, other than Québec, it is possible for the owner of certain registered products, such as RRSP, RRIF and TFSA, to designate a beneficiary (in that case, the beneficiary will receive the death benefit outside of the estate and avoid probate fees).</li>
