<ul>
<li>A life insurance contract is formed by two parties:<ul>
<li>Insurer – the life insurance company that issues the insurance policy;</li>
<li>Policyholder – the owner of the life insurance policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The policyholder is also the “insured” (which may be different than the “life insured”).</li>
<li>A life insurance policy is simply the contract between an insurer (insurance company) and the policyholder. Depending on the type of insurance, there may be other persons referenced or involved (such as the life insured, the beneficiary, a contingent beneficiary, a successor owner or an assignee).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="211-insurer">2.1.1 Insurer<a class="headerlink" href="#211-insurer" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The insurer is the life insurance company that issues the insurance policy.</li>
<li>Through corporate purchases and amalgamations, the insurer may change over the life of the policy. When there is a change in the insurer, the rights and obligations under a policy are assigned to and assumed by the new insurer. The new insurer is required by regulators to issue certificates of assumption to affected policyholders. All terms of the policy continue to be binding on the parties to the policy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="212-policyholder">2.1.2 Policyholder<a class="headerlink" href="#212-policyholder" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The policyholder is the legal owner of the life insurance policy:<ul>
<li>The policyholder can be an individual or a corporation;</li>
<li>There can be multiple policyholders for a single policy where each policyholder may own different portions of the policy. For example, a business owner can structure a universal life policy so that the business itself (the corporation) becomes the owner of the death benefit but the business owner retains ownership of savings and investment component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 1</p>
<p>Thelma and Arthur are spouses. They co-own a policy on both their lives, which will pay the death benefit when the second life insured dies.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 2</p>
<p>Elliot and Alice are siblings. After a meeting with their father and their agent, they have opted to own and pay for an annuity policy with their father as beneficiary. This annuity provides for the care and financial needs of their father who retired with limited income. This ensures that as siblings, they will both have access to policy information and that any beneficiary changes to the policy must be approved and signed jointly.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 3</p>
<p>Roger owns ABC Bikes Inc., a cycling equipment company. The company needs financial protection against the death of Roger, who is a key person in its operations. Roger purchases insurance on his life and assigns the ownership of the death benefit to the company. Roger retains ownership of the savings and investment component, where he will be able to shelter personal investment capital for retirement. The company and Roger divide the cost of the insurance on a reasonable basis, with the help of their accountant.</p>

<h4 id="2121-successor-policyholder">2.1.2.1 Successor policyholder<a class="headerlink" href="#2121-successor-policyholder" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>When the policyholder is not the life insured, a policy may also have a successor policyholder (sometimes called the contingent policyholder, successor-owner or subrogated owner):<ul>
<li>The successor policyholder becomes the policyholder if the original policyholder dies before the life insured dies (i.e., before the policy pays a death benefit);</li>
<li>If the policyholder has not named a successor policyholder, then the new owner will be his estate and therefore indirectly his estate beneficiaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Roger owns a policy on his own life and one on the life of his spouse, Susan. Roger wants ownership of the policy on Susan to pass to her if he dies first, and not to his children, so he appoints Susan as the successor owner by an amendment to his policy. While Susan is not a party to the policy during Roger’s life, after his death Susan will acquire all of the rights and privileges that Roger had under the policy.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="213-life-insured">2.1.3 Life insured<a class="headerlink" href="#213-life-insured" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The life insured is the person whose life is insured – the policy pays the death benefit when this person dies.</li>
<li>There may be multiple lives insured under one policy.</li>
<li>For life insurance to be valid at issue, the policyholder must have an insurable interest in the life of the life insured.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="214-beneficiary">2.1.4 Beneficiary<a class="headerlink" href="#214-beneficiary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The beneficiary is the person (or corporation) who receives the insurance proceeds when a death benefit is paid according to the insurance policy.</li>
<li>Anyone can be named as a beneficiary.</li>
<li>A preferred beneficiary includes:<ul>
<li>Spouse (including the common-law spouse);</li>
<li>Child;</li>
<li>Grandchild;</li>
<li>Parent of the life insured.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The preferred beneficiary is also known as “protected” or “family class” beneficiaries. Designating individuals from this class as beneficiaries of a policy protects the death benefit and the policy itself from execution and seizure by creditors.</li>
<li>The policyholder may later name or change a beneficiary using a beneficiary designation or change form issued by the insurer unless the existing designation is irrevocable.</li>
<li>Beneficiary designations are revocable unless designated as irrevocable. With revocable beneficiary designations, a different beneficiary, including another protected class beneficiary can be named without the beneficiary’s permission.</li>
<li>There may be restrictions on a policyholder changing beneficiary designations, such as a separation agreement, or even a Court order, despite the fact that a designation may be shown on the records of an insurer as revocable.</li>
<li>It is important for agents to be aware that insurers will pay the death benefit based on the most recent beneficiary designation recorded on file, or to the estate in accordance with the most recent will or estate document filed with the insurer if there is no beneficiary designation.</li>
<li>An individual can also designate his/her estate as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. In this case, the executor or estate trustee would distribute the proceeds according to policyholders’ will or the relevant provincial law if the policyholder died intestate.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2141-irrevocable-beneficiary-designations">2.1.4.1 Irrevocable beneficiary designations<a class="headerlink" href="#2141-irrevocable-beneficiary-designations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Where a beneficiary designation has been designated as irrevocable, such a declaration must be filed with the head office of the insurer to become valid.</li>
<li>When the designation is irrevocable, the policyholder (policy owner) must first obtain the consent of the beneficiary before making a change of beneficiary.</li>
<li>If the beneficiary does not consent to the change, the policy owner cannot change the beneficiary designation.</li>
<li>According to The Insurance Act in Nova Scotia, to make a valid irrevocable beneficiary designation, the irrevocable beneficiary designation must contain, attached to the policy, the following declaration signed by the insured:<ul>
<li>I understand that the effect of my designating a beneficiary irrevocably is that, under the provisions of the Insurance Act, while the beneficiary is living, I may not alter or revoke the designation without the consent of the beneficiary and I may not assign, exercise rights under or in respect of, surrender or otherwise deal with the contract without the consent of the beneficiary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It must also contain the following declaration signed by the agent:<ul>
<li>I certify that I have fully explained to the insured the nature and effect of making an irrevocable designation of beneficiary and such explanation was given to the insured not in the presence of the beneficiary and that the insured indicated that he was aware of the irrevocable nature of the designation so made by him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A policy with an irrevocable beneficiary designation is exempt from execution of judgment and seizure by creditors.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2142-restriction-in-legislative-definition-of-beneficiary">2.1.4.2 Restriction in legislative definition of beneficiary<a class="headerlink" href="#2142-restriction-in-legislative-definition-of-beneficiary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Some Insurance Acts define “beneficiary” as “a person, other than the insured or the insured’s personal representative to whom the death benefit should be paid.”</li>
<li>A policyholder or his/her estate does not qualify as a “beneficiary” under the Insurance Act.</li>
<li>Meeting the requirements of the statutory definition could be critical in determining whether a life insurance policy can enjoy potential creditor protection.</li>
<li>In all provinces and territories except Québec, creditor protection hinges on the relationship between the life insured and the beneficiary (not between the policyholder and beneficiary).</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 1</p>
<p>Ted owns a policy on the life of his wife Laura and has named himself as the beneficiary. Ted is the policyholder, i.e., the person who entered into the policy with the insurer. Ted, therefore, does not qualify as a “beneficiary” under the statutory definition. He will still receive the insurance money if Laura dies. If Laura owned the policy on her life, so that she was both the insured, as well as the life insured, and she named Ted as her beneficiary, he would qualify as a “beneficiary” under the legislative definition.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 2</p>
<p>Rick purchases a policy on his own life. He is both the policyholder and life insured. He designates his spouse Renee as beneficiary. She qualifies as a “beneficiary” under the statutory definition, since she is not the policyholder. The proceeds are therefore presumed to be protected from the creditors of Rick’s estate. Also, since Renee is the spouse of the life insured (Rick), Renee is also within the protected class of beneficiaries. Accordingly, the rights and interests of Rick in the contract itself during his lifetime are also exempt from execution or seizure.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="2143-loss-of-protection">2.1.4.3 Loss of protection<a class="headerlink" href="#2143-loss-of-protection" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The designation of a beneficiary, including a protected class beneficiary, is subject to being set aside and ignored if it is made in an attempt to defeat, delay, or hinder creditors.</li>
<li>Thus, designations that are made in an attempt to defeat creditors may be subject to challenge, despite the insurance provisions. The same would apply to the purchase of a life annuity or segregated fund, which otherwise would benefit from protected status.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Rick owns a life policy with a very large cash value payable to his estate. He learns that a lawsuit from a business supplier has gone against him, and the creditor is about to obtain a judgment against him, so he designates his son Roger as a beneficiary. Roger is within the protected family class of beneficiaries, but the timing of Rick’s action shows it was intended to frustrate his supplier’s claim. Therefore, the designation may be subject to challenge.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="2144-contingent-beneficiary">2.1.4.4 Contingent beneficiary<a class="headerlink" href="#2144-contingent-beneficiary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A contingent beneficiary or secondary beneficiary can be named so that if the primary beneficiary dies before the life insured dies (i.e., before the insurance policy pays a death benefit) then the contingent beneficiary becomes the one entitled to receive the benefits payable.</li>
<li>If there are multiple beneficiaries (primary or contingent) and one or more die before the life insured, the policy provisions, beneficiary designation form provisions (also part of the policy) or statutory provisions (in default of policy provisions), may determine how the proceeds are redistributed.</li>
<li>If there is no valid primary or contingent beneficiary designation in effect on the death of the life insured, the insurance proceeds will be paid to the current policyholder or to its estate if the policyholder dies after the primary and contingent beneficiary.</li>

<ul>
<li>A group insurance policy insures the lives or health of a group of individuals:<ul>
<li>Spousal and dependent coverage are often available with many group plans;</li>
<li>The group of individuals is typically restricted to the employees of a company or members of a group such as a union or association.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2151-plan-sponsor">2.1.5.1 Plan sponsor<a class="headerlink" href="#2151-plan-sponsor" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>In a group insurance policy, the plan sponsor enters into the master contract (insurance policy) with the insurer (insurance company).</li>
<li>The plan sponsor is typically an employer, union, association, or some other entity that represents the group.</li>
<li>The plan sponsor is also known as the group insured or the group policyholder.</li>
<li>The plan sponsor decides on the terms of the insurance policy (and potential insurance benefits available) for the members of the group.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2152-insurer">2.1.5.2 Insurer<a class="headerlink" href="#2152-insurer" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The insurer (the life insurance company) does not have individual policies with each member of the group. Rather, there is a single contract between the insurer and the plan sponsor (group policyholder).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2153-members-and-scope-of-coverage-to-other-insured-persons">2.1.5.3 Members and scope of coverage to other insured persons<a class="headerlink" href="#2153-members-and-scope-of-coverage-to-other-insured-persons" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The group life insured refers to any person whose life is insured under the group policy.</li>
<li>Group plans define who is eligible for coverage, which typically includes the members (also called “participants” or “enrollees”) of the group and their families.</li>
<li>With employer-sponsored plans (as opposed to a union or association), a basic level of coverage is typically mandatory for each employee. Many plans offer the ability to apply for “optional” increased insurance coverage, which is subject to individual underwriting.</li>
<li>Membership in an employee group plan is mandatory so that the insurer can count on a relatively constant number of lives, upon which the premiums may be calculated. Another reason is to prevent the “anti-selection of the risks.”</li>
<li>An employee must enroll in the plan within a defined period of time after gaining eligibility status.</li>
<li>Subject to the provisions of the plan, making coverage changes is usually limited to an annual event, or perhaps to times when there are life changes in the group life insured’s situation, such as marriage, births or adoptions.</li>

<h4 id="2154-beneficiaries">2.1.5.4 Beneficiaries<a class="headerlink" href="#2154-beneficiaries" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>

<h2 id="22-formation-of-policy">2.2 Formation of Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#22-formation-of-policy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In common law, for a contract to be formed, there must be:<ul>
<li>An agreement as to what is being contracted (the terms of the contract);</li>
<li>An exchange of value, including a promise, to make the insurance policy binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example, with life insurance, the exchange of value is that the insurer promises to pay a benefit upon the occurrence of a specified condition, and the policyholder agrees to pay the premiums.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="221-rules-about-forming-an-individual-insurance-contract">2.2.1 Rules about forming an individual insurance contract<a class="headerlink" href="#221-rules-about-forming-an-individual-insurance-contract" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The process of forming any contract is often described as having two steps, called “offer” and“acceptance.” The offer may be outstanding for a limited period of time, according to its terms. If not accepted, it may be withdrawn.</li>
<li>With an insurance contract, the concept of offer and acceptance is unique. An insurance agent presenting a proposal to a potential client is not representative of an offer of insurance in the standard offer-acceptance principles of contracting. Rather, in practice, the completion of an insurance application by an individual is generally considered an offer where the individual becomes the offeror. Then, in practice, the offer is generally accepted when the insurance carrier issues the contract and the contract is delivered to the applicant. However, under the law of the Canadian common law jurisdictions, it is the insurer’s tender of the policy which constitutes the “offer,” and the “acceptance” takes place only when the applicant decides to take (receive) the policy. Tender of delivery by the insurer is its offer and indicates its willingness to insure the risk not a binding contract, which is consummated only when the insured accepts the policy on delivery. The insurer and the applicant have clearly effected the contract, and that is the point of view where it may be said that the contract is “made.”</li>
<li>In comparison with ordinary contracts, life insurance policies have several additional requirements before they are considered to be valid and in effect.</li>
<li>The requirements are:<ul>
<li>Application for insurance and representation of risk;</li>
<li>Temporary or conditional insurance coverage;</li>
<li>Changes in insurability;</li>
<li>Acceptance of application by insurer;</li>
<li>Payment of initial premium;</li>
<li>Delivery of policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2211-application-for-insurance-and-representation-of-risk">2.2.1.1 Application for insurance and representation of risk<a class="headerlink" href="#2211-application-for-insurance-and-representation-of-risk" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>It is the policyholder and the insurer who are the parties to the policy.</li>
<li>When completing an insurance application, it is important that agents not paraphrase. Questions should be asked to the client exactly as written in the application, so as to ensure a complete and accurate response for the insurer.</li>
<li>The answers recorded in the application are used as a benchmark against which “changes in insurability” are later measured when the insurance policy is issued.</li>
<li>All of the answers provided by the applicant (and the proposed life insured when both the proposed life insured is different from the applicant) on both the application form and any additional document such as a questionnaire constitute representations to the insurer that it will rely upon during the underwriting process.</li>

<li>When applying for insurance, it typically takes several weeks (sometimes months) for an insurer to complete their underwriting process and issue a policy.</li>
<li>However, applicants can sometimes obtain temporary coverage during this process. If the applicant can answer “no” to three or four temporary insurance questions confirming good health and no illness or hospital visits.</li>
<li>The temporary coverage is typically for 90 days, is subject to terms and conditions outlined in a separate temporary coverage agreement and expires once the policy applied for, is approved, or declined.</li>

<ul>
<li>Change in insurability – If the client has a “change in insurability” between when the application was made and when the policy is delivered, then the policy does not take effect. Even if it was delivered, accepted and the first premium had been paid.</li>
<li>A change in insurability corresponds to a change in risk, and, therefore, the insurance company is entitled to know about any such changes before being bound to the coverage.</li>
<li>This is the case whether the policyholder and the life insured knew about the change in insurability, or not.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>George applied for life insurance in October. In November, he went to his physician to get a routine influenza shot. The insurance policy was to be delivered in early December. If George is asked by the agent about changes in his insurability, he could truthfully answer “none,” even if he is not entirely sure what that means. But, if George is asked whether anything has happened that would change an answer in his application, he must answer “yes” and disclose his medical appointment and influenza shot, since applications typically ask about the date of the last visit to the doctor and any treatment prescribed or recommended. The insurance company can then decide if the updated information changes anything; in this case, they would give the agent permission to go ahead and deliver the policy.</p>

<ul>
<li>When an insurance policy is delivered to the client, the client has 10 days to review the policy and decide if he or she wants to keep the coverage or not.</li>
<li>During this time, the client can change his or her mind and return the policy for a full refund.</li>
<li>If the client chooses to exercise this “right of rescission” then the policy is annulled (the technical term is rescission), which means the contract is withdrawn and cancelled.</li>
<li>The 10-day-free look applies to all individually owned life and A&amp;S insurance policies. Therefore, a policyholder can rescind an insurance contract within 10 days of signing or accepting delivery of the policy, without penalty and with a reimbursement of the premiums paid.</li>

<li>The insurer provides the certificates to the employer, who then distributes to the individuals.</li>
<li>The certificate contains individualized information for that particular group, including:<ul>
<li>The name of the insurer;</li>
<li>Identification of the contract;</li>
<li>The amount (or the method of determining the amount) of insurance on any person whose life is insured under the plan (member, spouse, or dependent);</li>

<ul>
<li>AD&amp;D insurance covers the risk of suffering a defined physical loss or death due to an accident.</li>
<li>Physical losses can include loss of limbs, hearing or eyesight.</li>
<li>The insurance policy states the death benefits and the benefits payable for dismemberment (or paralysis) are often expressed as a percentage of the death benefit payable. For example, consider a policy with a death benefit of $100,000 and a 50% benefit payable for the loss of a limb. In this case, if the insured loses his arm, he would receive $50,000.</li>
<li>Processing a death claim may take some time as the insurer needs to determine if the death was accidental and not caused by some exclusion.</li>
<li>The definition of “accident” for insurance purposes is complex and often includes many restrictions and exclusions:<ul>
<li>Insurers might not pay if the death or dismemberment is a result of the following exclusions:</li>
<li>Death from or involving sickness;</li>
<li>Illness;</li>
<li>Bodily or mental infirmity or disease;</li>
<li>Suicide or self-inflicted injury;</li>

<li>FIO – Future Income Option is a benefit that may be added to some policies which gives the policy owner the option to increase his/her coverage whenever he/she earns an increase in income. This ensures the policy continues to adequately cover the individual over time.</li>

<li>Benefits are often paid on a weekly or monthly basis.</li>
<li>Benefits are not intended to replace income, and can be spent in any way the policy owner chooses.</li>
<li>All LTC plans have a waiting period – the period of time an individual must wait before they can make a claim.</li>
<li>The waiting period is also known as the elimination period. In Canada, all LTC policies have a waiting period - typically 30, 90, or 180 days:<ul>

<li>A policy will be terminated for non-payment of premiums (after the expiry of any grace period defined in the policy).</li>
<li>If the insurer is providing notice of termination to the client by postal mail, unlike life insurance a 10 days’ written notice is required measured from the day after the notice is mailed. The 10 days would be in addition to the grace period, if the cancellation is for non-payment.</li>
<li>Cancellable – refers to the type of policy where the insurer can cancel the policy by providing written notice and satisfying the notice period. Policies can be cancelled for reasons other than non-payment of premiums.</li>

<li>Annuities are insurance policies, designed to pay a fixed amount over a specified period of time.</li>
<li>Annuity contracts may be used as investments, financial security, tax planning, estate planning, and/or creditor protection.</li>
<li>With a life annuity, benefits are paid for the duration of a person’s life. Whereas a term annuity pays benefits for only a defined period of time (also called a fixed-term annuity).</li>
<li>Annuities (life annuities as well as fixed-term annuities) issued by life insurance companies are treated as life insurance under the various provincial and territorial insurance acts.</li>
<li>Annuities can be either individual or as group contracts.</li>
<li>Annuities can be purchased as either registered contracts (that is, purchased with funds from an RRSP, RRIF, TFSA, RRP, DPSP, LIF, LIRA, etc.), or as unregistered contracts.</li>
<li>With deferred annuities, payments start at some later date. The start date is called the maturity date. This allows for the investment and accumulation of income over the period of time before payments begin.</li>
<li>With immediate annuities, payments start immediately.</li>
<li>The annuity contracts products available on the market are:<ul>
<li>Annuity contracts relating to segregated funds are also deferred annuities, and can be owned in either individual or group plans;</li>
<li>Guaranteed interest accounts (GIA), which may be available as an individual or group annuity. This type of annuity is a deferred annuity. The amounts (called “contributions” or “premiums”) are alienated by the holder to the insurer to purchase a non-variable annuity contract; and</li>
