<li>Ethical conduct and closely following professional practice standards are both critical to the role of licensed insurance agents.</li>
<li>Insurance regulators deliver regulatory services that both strengthen public confidence, as well as protect the public interest in the sectors they regulate.</li>
<li>These high standards are key to earning the public’s trust in the insurance industry as well as in the profession of insurance agent.</li>
<li>Therefore, demonstrating ethical conduct and giving constructive advice is very important in terms of building a trusting relationship between the life insurance agent and client. Ethical conduct refers to:<ul>
<li>Managing cases of conflict of interest;</li>
<li>Client needs analysis;</li>
<li>Selling ethically;</li>
<li>Meeting fiduciary duties; and</li>
<li>Satisfying statutes, regulations and codes of conduct.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Agents can receive fines and/or lose their licence for breaking industry rules.</li>
<li>It is important that insurance agents have a clear understanding of the important concepts and factual examples outlined in this chapter. The information provided in this chapter demonstrates the high ethical standards expected of the agent when conducting business.</li>

<ul>
<li>Regulations for insurance companies are legislated and instituted by the federal, provincial and territorial governments.</li>
<li>Rules and Principles Governing the Activities of Life Insurance Agents and Accident &amp; Sickness Insurance Agents</li>
<li>Under the supervision of Insurance Companies Act, as well as the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), the federal government is responsible for overseeing and determining “the financial soundness” of federally incorporated life insurance companies.</li>
<li>The provincial and territorial governments are responsible for:<ul>
<li>Determining the financial soundness of the provincially or territorially incorporated life insurance companies;</li>
<li>The licensing of insurance agents in the respective provinces and territories;</li>
<li>Overseeing the licensing of insurance companies operating within their jurisdictions as well as the marketing of insurance products; and</li>
<li>Regulating market conduct.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>According to the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators (CCIR), both the provincial and territorial governments are responsible for regulating market conduct.</li>
<li>Regulating market conduct refers to the overseeing “of any product or service relationship between the insurance industry, insurers, agents, clients and the public.”</li>
<li>Market conduct “is influenced by many factors such as laws, established best practices, codes of conduct, and client expectations.”</li>
<li>According to the CCIR, risk-based regulation is an important priority. This refers to regulation, which directs the regulator’s efforts at those issues which could potentially negatively impact on clients.</li>
<li>This approach is used “to focus regulatory attention on insurers where indicators suggest there is a high risk of non-compliance with the legislation rather than giving every insurer equal weight and examining them all.” In other words, breaches of compliance systematically generate increased supervision by regulators.</li>
<li>Regulatory authorities must ensure fair, responsible and professional conduct by life insurance agents. They fulfill their mandate by setting expectations and requirements for regulating the conduct of life insurance agents towards clients, including:<ul>
<li>Promoting transparency to clients;</li>
<li>Taking enforcement actions against breaches of conduct;</li>
<li>Equipping clients with financial knowledge and skills (i.e., understanding financial concepts and terminology);</li>
<li>Giving clients access to independent complaint resolution avenues, such as the OmbudService for Life and Health Insurance.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The Canadian Insurance Services Regulatory Organizations (CISRO) is “an inter-jurisdictional group of regulating authorities who are dedicated to developing consistent standards of qualifications and practice for insurance intermediaries dealing in insurance of persons and property.”</li>
<li>The key function of CISRO is to administer the regulatory system applicable to insurance intermediaries.</li>
<li>CISRO members cannot enact legislation.</li>
<li>However, CISRO members act as key advisors regarding insurance intermediaries to their respective provincial and territorial governments.</li>
<li>Maintaining transparency regarding disciplinary actions taken by insurance regulators is important for the industry and client. The CISRO website includes disciplinary actions taken by insurance regulators on their site. One can access the CISRO website at: <a href="http://www.cisro-ocra.com/">http://www.cisro-ocra.com/</a>.</li>
<li>Through the Joint Forum of Financial Market Regulators, regulatory authorities work with other authorities and agencies and maintain a dialogue with clients’ associations to constructively discuss issues faced by the life insurance buying public.</li>
<li>In September 2018, CISRO, in collaboration with CCIR, has published a Guidance entitled Conduct of Insurance Business and fair treatment of Customers, which applies to insurers as well as well as insurance intermediaries (individual agents, brokers and representatives).</li>

<ul>
<li>The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada’s mission and mandate is to administer enforcement of the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).</li>
<li>The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada’s role is to “protect and promote the privacy rights of individuals.”1</li>
<li>PIPEDA oversees the information managing practices of private sector organizations everywhere in Canada except, British Columbia, Alberta and Québec as well as the health-care sector of Ontario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador.</li>
<li>In all of Canada, PIPEDA continues to apply to the federally regulated private sector.</li>
<li>Life insurance agents working in British Columbia, Alberta and Québec must follow the personal information protection act of their own provinces.</li>
<li>Life insurance agents must keep client information confidential and secure.</li>

<h4 id="4142-financial-transactions-and-reports-analysis-centre-of-canada-fintrac">4.1.4.2 Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC)<a class="headerlink" href="#4142-financial-transactions-and-reports-analysis-centre-of-canada-fintrac" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>FINTRAC helps protect the integrity of the Canadian financial system by ensuring life insurance agents comply with regulation outlined in Canada’s Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.</li>
<li>Life insurance agents have a responsibility to report suspicious transactions and terrorist property.</li>
<li>The agent’s role under Canada’s Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act is to focus on the four following areas:<ul>
<li>Ascertaining each client’s identity and confirming the existence of entities;</li>
<li>Third-party determination;</li>
<li>Determination of the purpose;</li>
<li>Determination of politically exposed persons and heads of international organizations;</li>
<li>Obligation to report suspicious transactions, terrorist property and large cash transactions.
<strong>Ascertaining each client’s identity</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Regulations and FINTRAC’s Guidances, the life insurance agent is required to establish a client’s identity who:<ul>
<li>Is purchasing an immediate or deferred annuity; or</li>
<li>Is purchasing a life insurance policy that is not an exempt policy, towards which the client can pay a minimum of $10,000 during the annuity or policy, regardless of the payment method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exempted products consist of:<ul>
<li>Individual or group registered retirement income plans (RRSP, RRIF, LIRA, LIF, DPSP, RPP, and TFSA);</li>
<li>Exempt life insurance policies; and</li>
<li>Health or accident insurance policies with no cash surrender value (CSV).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is important for the agent to record the information covered by these laws in the client information record.</li>
<li>While the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act does not require agents to ascertain the client’s identity for certain products, the insurer has obligations under the Act that may require the agent to ascertain the client’s identity.</li>
<li>Also, confirming the identity of a client can ensure that the client’s age has been accurately reported or that the insurer has acted in accordance with its obligations under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). FATCA is an American law intended to prevent tax evasion by U.S. residents and citizens who hold accounts outside of the U.S.
<strong>Non-registered plans</strong></li>
<li>The agent is obligated to ascertain each holder, owner and joint holder’s identity in person.</li>
<li>The client must bring an identification document with a unique identifier number from a provincial, territorial or federal government.</li>
<li>Originals of the following are acceptable identification documents which the client may use to prove their identity:<ul>
<li>Government-issued photo identification method where the document must be authentic, valid and current;</li>
<li>Credit file method where the information must be valid and current; or;</li>
<li>Dual-process method where the information must be valid and current and from different sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FINTRAC’s Guidance also indicates how to identify the identity of an individual when the agent is not physically in presence of the individual he has to identify.</li>
<li>An insurance agent can use an individual’s provincial health card, but only if it is not prohibited by provincial or territorial legislation.</li>
<li>The insurance agent may use a social insurance card to verify the identity of a client, but a social insurance number may not be used in a declaration made to FINTRAC. Most insurers refuse that insurance agents use a social insurance card to verify the identity of a client.
<strong>Confirming the existence of the entity and identifying the beneficial owners</strong>
<strong>Individual or group insurance for an entity</strong></li>
<li>The agent is obligated to ascertain the client’s identity if the client is a corporation or another type of entity.</li>
<li>The client must then provide sufficient proof of identity, such as a corporate status certificate and the names of the directors.</li>
<li>The client must provide the insurer with the name, date of birth and information on the authorized signatories of the corporation or entity (i.e., company, not-for-profit organization, estates, trusts, etc.).
<strong>Individual or group insurance for an entity other than an estate or trust</strong></li>
<li>The client must provide the insurer with all of the individuals’ names owning a share of the entity along with the home address and professional details on individuals who control 25% or more of the entity.</li>
<li>The agent must collect additional information if the client is a legal person (company) or another form of entity, such as the ultimate beneficiaries of the entity (the identity of the individuals who ultimately control the legal person or other form of entity). This cannot be another legal person or entity.</li>
<li>Typically, insurance forms state what information to request.</li>
<li>When the client is a legal person (company) or another form of entity, the insurance agent must also confirm and retain the information on the ultimate beneficiaries of the entity, or, in other words, the identity of the individuals who ultimately control the legal person or other form of entity (beneficial ownership), which cannot be another legal person or entity. These obligations include:<ul>
<li>obtaining information that describes the ownership, control and structure of the entity, including corporations and trusts; and</li>
<li>if the entity is a corporation, obtaining the names of all the directors, as well as the names and addresses of the beneficial owners;</li>
<li>if the entity is a trust, obtaining the names and addresses of all trustees and known beneficiaries and settlors of the trust;</li>
<li>if the entity is other than a corporation or trust, obtaining the names and addresses of the beneficial owners; and</li>
<li>taking reasonable measures to confirm the accuracy of the information obtained, and keeping records of the information obtained and the measures taken to confirm its accuracy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If an entity is a not-for-profit organization, the life insurance agent must also determine if the entity is a registered charity under the Income Tax Act or if it is an unregistered not-for-profit organization that solicits charitable donations from the public.
<strong>Third-party determination</strong></li>
<li>The agent must verify, with certainty, the identity of the individual who is submitting the insurance application.</li>
<li>A third-party determination form must be completed if the person applying for insurance is acting on behalf of a third party (for example, a power of attorney).</li>
<li>The third-party denomination form must specify the following:<ul>
<li>If the third party is an individual - the individual’s name, address, date of birth and nature of his principal business or occupation (if the third party is an individual);</li>
<li>If the third party is an entity - its name, address and nature of its principal business;</li>
<li>If the third party is a corporation - its incorporation number and place of incorporation; and</li>
<li>The nature of the relationship between the insured and the person completing the application (the third party).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In some cases, the insurance agent has reasonable grounds to suspect that the individual is acting on behalf of a third party but cannot determine it in the typical way described above. In this case, the individual or entity must keep a document that:<ul>
<li>According to the client, states if the transaction is being conducted on behalf of a third party; and</li>
<li>Outlines the reasonable grounds to suspect that the client is indeed acting on behalf of a third party.
<strong>Determination of politically exposed persons (PEP) and heads of international organizations (HIO)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A life insurance agent must take reasonable measures to determine if a person is a foreign PEP, a domestic PEP, a HIO, or the family member or close associate of one of these, if the person makes a lump-sum payment of $100,000 or more towards an immediate or deferred annuity or life insurance policy, on their own behalf or at the instruction of someone else. A life insurance agent must also take reasonable measures to establish the source of funds for the lump-sum transaction for these persons.</li>
<li>Reasonable measures include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following actions:<ul>
<li>asking the client;</li>
<li>conducting an open source search; or</li>
<li>consulting a source of commercially available information.
<strong>Determination of the purpose</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since February 1, 2014, the client must indicate the purpose of the product they are purchasing.
<strong>Obligation to report suspicious transactions</strong></li>
<li>Suspicious transactions (attempted or completed) must be reported by the agent to FINTRAC as soon as practicable after the agent’s first suspicion.</li>
<li>If an agent suspects that a transaction (or group of transactions) constitutes money laundering or used to finance terrorist activities, the agent must report the transaction (or group of transactions).</li>
<li>Note that the intention to conduct a suspicious transaction should also be reported.</li>
<li>These are some suspicious transaction indicators that an agent is most likely to notice:<ul>
<li>The client refuses to provide the required identification documents and seeks to establish his identity through means other than identification documents or unreasonably delays submitting company documents;</li>
<li>The client acts withdrawn or anxious, explains himself in a strange way or is monitored or accompanied by another individual;</li>
<li>The client shows unusual curiosity about internal controls or unusual knowledge of legislation on suspicious transaction reporting;</li>
<li>The client deposits third-party cheques for very large amounts;</li>
<li>The client is more interested in the ramifications of a product’s termination than its long-term benefits;</li>
<li>The transaction is disproportionally complicated for its purpose;</li>
<li>The transaction is not in line with the client’s apparent financial situation or strange activities; and</li>
<li>The client provides a P.O. Box in an area where P.O. Boxes are not generally used (i.e., cities).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note that failure to comply with this protocol can lead to serious criminal charges against the agent.</li>
<li>On the other hand, if suspicious transactions are reported in a timely fashion and in good faith, the agent is protected against legal action.
<strong>Obligation to report terrorist property</strong></li>
<li>When the life Insurance agent knows that property in Is possession or under his control is owned, controlled by or on behalf of a terrorist or a terrorist group, the life Insurance agent must submit a report without delay. The life Insurance agent must also submit a report to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).
<strong>Obligation to report large cash transaction</strong></li>
<li>Requirements also apply to large cash transactions, such as a single deposit of $10,000 or more, or two or more $10,000 deposits within a 24-hour period. Insurers, however, rarely accept cash payments.</li>
<li>When a client purchasing a policy makes a deposit of $100,000 or more, in any payment form, the agent must check whether the client is a politically exposed foreign person. The agent has 15 days after the transaction to report this type of client. Generally, a politically exposed foreign person is someone who has held a government or legal position in a foreign country, or is the spouse or a close family member of this individual. Insurance forms contain information on this subject.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4143-assuris">4.1.4.3 Assuris<a class="headerlink" href="#4143-assuris" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Assuris is a not-for-profit organization whose mandate is to protect Canadian policyholders in the event that their life insurance company should fail.</li>
<li>Life insurance agents must have a clear understanding of what would occur if an insurance company would become bankrupt.</li>
<li>Clients are automatically covered under Assuris as all federal and most provincially regulated insurance companies must be a part of Assuris.</li>
<li>In the case of insolvency, the insurer’s primary regulator would appoint a liquidator. The liquidator would try to:<ul>
<li>First, transfer the policies to other insurance companies;</li>
<li>Then, reduce benefits (if necessary). If benefits were reduced, Assuris protection would be applicable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assuris protection limits are outlined in the table below:</li>

<li>Putting in place an enhanced market conduct supervisory framework;</li>
<li>Enhancing the effectiveness of insurance intermediaries’ supervision;</li>
<li>Helping clients through directed financial education program such as fraud alerts and client information portals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>According to the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators (CCIR), companies or intermediaries potentially have an impact in their regions or on their respective customers, but a greater impact can be developed by the adoption of measures or regulations applicable to the industry as a whole.</li>

<li>Ethics and professionalism are key for insurance agents. All agents must abide by the principles and rules put in place by applicable legislation, codes of conduct, and contractual documents.</li>
<li>Non-compliance can lead to stiff penalties, which include fines and/or a loss of the agent’s licence.<ul>
<li>Principals and rules are imposed by all of the codes of conduct across Canada:</li>
<li>Principles motivate or encourage behaviour, for example, to “act in good faith”;</li>

<ul>
<li>Acting in good faith refers to acting in line with the client’s best interests.</li>
<li>Acting in good faith is key to an agent’s business conduct as well as a key element in the relevant code of conduct and ethics.</li>
<li>Acting in good faith consists of:<ul>
<li>Duty of care;</li>
<li>Integrity;</li>
<li>Competence.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4 id="4211-duty-of-care">4.2.1.1 Duty of care<a class="headerlink" href="#4211-duty-of-care" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Duty of care refers to the obligation and accountability of life insurance agents to avoid negligent acts or omissions.</li>
<li>According to the Code of Conduct from the Life Insurance Council of Alberta, duty of care refers to the fact that an agent must always put the client’s interests ahead of his own.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>After meeting with a client and completing the life application, Erica, a life insurance agent was in a rush to leave on a long weekend trip. She locked the application and initial premium in her desk drawer. However, she forgot to submit the application after the long weekend. It was not until a few weeks later when the client enquired about the status of the application that she remembered it was still inside the drawer. Erica’s action did not meet the standard of care expected of an agent, as she did not put her client’s interests first.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="4212-integrity">4.2.1.2 Integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#4212-integrity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Integrity is an essential characteristic of a life insurance agent. Acting with integrity includes:<ul>
<li>Being honest, trustworthy and fair;</li>
<li>Being reliable, dependable and respectful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>According to the Insurance Council of Manitoba’s Code of Conduct, if an agent lacks personal integrity, it is very difficult for an agent to make up for its lacking or restore the damage to his or her reputation.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Felicity, an insurance agent, helped a client apply for a multimillion-dollar permanent policy and collected the $100,000 annual premium with the application. Felicity believed that the permanent policy was not suitable for the client’s needs (without discussing it with her client) but proceeded with the application at the client’s request, as she was only interested in the commission she would receive from the insurer. Through her behaviour, Felicity demonstrated a lack of integrity.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="4213-competence">4.2.1.3 Competence<a class="headerlink" href="#4213-competence" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Agents should be aware of their own limits of expertise, and should only offer products, services, and advice for which they have the required skills and competence.</li>
<li>Agents should either ask for help or refer the client to a colleague when they are faced with a situation where they do not possess the necessary skills and/or knowledge required to offer advice.</li>
<li>According to the Insurance Council of British Columbia, “incompetent conduct can result in significant prejudice to clients and insurers.”</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Sandra, a life insurance agent, does not have experience in annuity products. She tells Amel, a prospective client, that she could prepare a customized proposal for a back-to-back insured annuity. This strategy, she says, will increase the client’s guaranteed stream of income at retirement while minimizing the tax payable. Sandra has committed to provide information on a complex transaction without understanding what is involved. Sandra should have just told Amel that she would obtain the technical assistance needed from colleagues in her agency. Together, they could have prepared a proposal that would have met the needs expressed by the client.</p>

<ul>
<li>A conflict of interest refers to a situation where the life agent’s interests do not align with the client’s interests. For example, when the life insurance agent seeks a personal financial gain through his or her actions even though that action does not coincide with the client’s needs.</li>
<li>Conflict of interest is not consistent with the regulatory expectations that clients should be treated in a fair way.</li>
<li>Any possible conflicts of interest are required to be disclosed and managed appropriately before a life insurance agent provides a client with advice or the client agrees on an insurance contract.</li>
<li>CCIR and CISRO require that agents address the following principles outlined below:<ul>
<li>Priority of client’s interest;</li>
<li>Disclosure of conflicts or potential conflicts of interest;</li>
<li>Product suitability.</li>

<li>Need-based sales practices refer to the agent making the best possible recommendations for potential clients.</li>
<li>An agent must first understand the client’s situation, and any advice or product recommendation must be suitable for the client.</li>
<li>Agents must be able to demonstrate that they have understood the needs of the client, and that they have put the client’s interests first.</li>
<li>According to the Alberta Code of Conduct, a life insurance agent must:<ul>
<li>Perform a client needs analysis by gathering all the necessary facts required to assess them;</li>
<li>Recommend products in line with the client’s needs;</li>
<li>Explain and document the product(s) recommended.</li>
</ul>

<li>Agents must not be involved in any business or occupation that would threaten the agent’s integrity, independence or competence. Typically, this is part of the agent’s licensing requirements.</li>
<li>Regulators can restrict other employment activities for life insurance agents. For example, agents are not allowed to simultaneously serve as clergymen, liquor store employees or police officers.</li>
<li>According to the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, “the individual must not be in a position to use coercion or undue influence to control, direct or secure insurance business.”</li>

<h4 id="4231-tied-selling">4.2.3.1 Tied selling<a class="headerlink" href="#4231-tied-selling" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Tied selling refers to making a purchase of one product conditional on the purchase of another.</li>
<li>This practice is not allowed because the transaction is more advantageous for the agent than to the client.</li>
<li>According to the life insurance and accident and sickness insurance agents’ Code of Conduct of Manitoba, “it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for an agent or broker to assist in or engage in the practice of tied selling.”</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Annick, a life insurance agent representing a single insurer, tells Gary, her client, that he qualifies for a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) loan. However, Annick tells Gary the loan is conditional on Gary transferring his current RRSPs into products offered by the life insurance company that Annick represents. This untrue and deceptive, but Gary trusts Annick and does as she suggests. Annick should never have made one transaction conditional on the purchase of another product or service. This is unethical behaviour as she is the only person to benefit from the transaction.</p>

<ul>
<li>Churning is when an agent recommends a client cancel one product to purchase another (usually from the same insurer) in order to generate commission.</li>
<li>This is a prohibited practice.</li>
<li>According to the CLHIA Guidelines churning is an “unacceptable sales practice.”</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Christine replaced an agent who had retired. In order to take advantage of her new clients for her own benefit, she advised one of them that he should buy a term annuity with his existing registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) to provide income, and reinvest the portion he did not need in an individual variable insurance contract (IVIC). Christine earned a commission on both the purchase of the annuity and the investment in the IVIC. A relative of the client discovered what had happened and complained to the insurer, who terminated Christine’s contract. The client subsequently sued Christine and the insurer.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Twisting is when an agent recommends a client cancel one product to purchase another (usually from a different insurer) in order to generate commission from the new sale even though the sale typically does not benefit the client.</li>
<li>The agent often withholds key information on the total consequences (i.e., financial loss) of cancelling their policy.</li>
<li>This is a prohibited practice.</li>
<li>According to the Independent Financial Brokers of Canada’s (IFBC) code of ethics, agents must not recommend the replacement of any product unless it is in the best interest of the client.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 1</p>

<li>Premium rebating refers to when an agent gives back (rebates) all or part of the premium paid by the client.</li>
<li>This is a prohibited practice.</li>
<li>According to the Insurance Act of Ontario, premium rebating is an “unfair or deceptive act or practice” when “a person pays, allows or gives, directly or indirectly, a rebate of all or part of the premium stipulated by a policy to a person insured or applying for insurance.”</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Irving met with his client’s son Steven, to sell him a life insurance policy. Since Steven was reluctant to sign, Irving offered to pay the first premium. In effect, Irving was offering a rebate. Irving should not offer to pay the first premium as an incentive for clients to purchase.</p>

<h4 id="4234-trafficking-in-insurance">4.2.3.4 Trafficking in insurance<a class="headerlink" href="#4234-trafficking-in-insurance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Trafficking is when an agent acts as a broker between a policyholder who wishes to sell a policy and another individual who wishes to buy a policy.</li>
<li>A policyholder involved in trafficking insurance will often sell his policy to a third party because he has a sufficient amount of wealth to “self-insure” without paying additional premiums or the beneficiaries have passed away.</li>
<li>This occurs typically with universal life (UL) or whole life policies and sometimes term insurance policies as well.</li>
<li>This practice is highly discouraged by the industry and is prohibited in Newfoundland and Labrador. Some insurers also have a policy against trafficking in insurance and will stop working with an agent who participates in it.</li>
<li>According to the Insurance Companies Act of Newfoundland and Labrador, “A person other than an insurer or its authorized agent who advertises or holds himself or herself out as a purchaser of life insurance policies or of benefits under life insurance policies or who traffics or trades in life insurance policies for the purpose of procuring the sale, surrender, transfer, assignment, pledge or hypothecation of them to himself or herself or another person, is guilty of an offence.”</li>

<li>Inducing to insure refers to when an agent offers a gift or some other form of payment to entice a client to purchase a product.</li>
<li>This is a prohibited practice.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 1</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Example 2</p>
<p>Nadia offers Silvano, a potential client, a discount on a policy benefit. She recommends adding a term rider free of charge if he buys a permanent life insurance policy. This is prohibited. Nadia should not try to induce a client into buying insurance by offering riders free of charge.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="4236-fronting">4.2.3.6 Fronting<a class="headerlink" href="#4236-fronting" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fronting refers to when an agent allows someone else to solicit and submit business under his/her name when the agent has not met the client and does not even know who the client is.</li>
<li>This is a prohibited practice and agents who participate in fronting risk losing their licence and being left with substantial chargebacks.</li>
<li>According to the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO) fronting refers to when:<ul>
<li>A licensed agent chooses to have a different agent who has nothing to do with the transaction sign as the agent of record or;</li>
<li>An unlicensed individual organizes the business and has a licensed person sign on their behalf.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example, to save time and effort, an agent splits her commission with an unlicensed person who carries out and completes business transactions in the agent’s name even though the agent has never met these clients.</li>
<li>It is unwise and inappropriate for an agent to “front” business generated by someone else. Agents should not allow themselves to be used by someone else. Keep in mind that if anything goes wrong, it is the agent who is accountable.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">

However, he has approached a relative to buy a term policy and has brought the completed application and cheque for the first premium to Donald.</p>
<p>Donald signs as agent of record and splits the commission with Abner. Donald should never have employed Abner without the approved licence nor signed him as agent of record and Abner should not have approached potential clients until he had obtained his licence. Donald risks having his licence revoked and Abner risks never being able to obtain a licence.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unnecessary delay in delivering policies refers to when an agent holds or retains documents that should be delivered to the client.</li>
<li>This is a prohibited practice.</li>
<li>According to the Insurance Council of British Columbia’s Code of Conduct, agents “must deliver insurance policies or evidence of insurance within a reasonable period of time.”</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">

<ul>
<li>Misappropriating client funds is when an agent receives money from a client for a specific purpose and fraudulently uses it for something else.</li>
<li>This is a prohibited and illegal practice.</li>
<li>According to the Alberta Insurance Council Code of Conduct, an agent receiving funds on behalf of an insurer must ensure to:<ul>
<li>Not encumber (obstruct) the funds without the prior consent of the insurer;</li>
<li>Not use or apply the funds for purposes other than as described in the agreement with the insurer or the client;</li>
<li>Pay to the insurer all funds collected or received.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For premium payments submitted with an application, insurance companies typically require a cheque to be drawn on a client’s account and do not allow cash transactions.</li>
<li>Cash not only complicates record keeping but also makes the agent vulnerable to accusations of wrongdoing if the insured insists he paid the agent more than he truly did.</li>
<li>Money should never be deposited by an agent into his or her personal account - even if the aim is to give a cheque from that account to an insurer.</li>
<li>Typically, firm rules exist concerning third-party payments for premiums and are included in the insurance contract.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Joe, a life insurance agent, asks two of his clients to make their cheques payable to him for transmission to the insurer concerned. The first cheque is for investing into a tax-free savings account (TFSA) and the second cheque is for repaying a loan against a whole life policy. A few days later, Joe informs his clients that the funds have been sent to the insurer when, in fact, he deposited the money into his own bank account. Joe was subsequently arrested by police and convicted of theft over $5,000 under the Criminal Code. Evidence of misappropriation of client funds is sufficient to support a finding that Joe should be prevented from being licensed as a life agent.</p>

<div class="admonition example">

<p>Nabila, an agent, does not disclose to the insurer that Leslie, the applicant, has a pre-existing health condition.

Believing that it would be in Leslie’s best interest to have the insurance, Nabila completes the application without noting Leslie’s pre-existing health condition. Nabila explains to Leslie that omitting this “detail” will keep the premium down and Leslie gratefully signs the application.</p>
<p>Upon Leslie’s death, her beneficiaries were expecting the funds needed to pay off the balance owed on Leslie’s mortgage. Instead, as a result of the misrepresentation of Leslie’s health on her application, the insurer returned the premiums paid, a much lower amount, leaving her beneficiaries with no choice but to sell the house to pay off the mortgage.

<li>It must be clear to the licensee that the individual to whom they are paying the referral fee did not undergo any insurance activities, in other words, did not act as an insurance agent, with the client;</li>
<li>Following this, the client is given a written disclosure affirming that the individual is being compensated for the referral.</li>

<li>Steps involved for obtaining a life insurance licence and becoming a life insurance agent:<ul>
<li>The applicant must pass the LLQP;</li>
<li>The applicant must submit a fully completed application to the licensing authority;</li>
<li>The application must then be approved;</li>
<li>All forms must be honestly and accurately filled out by the new applicants;</li>

<ul>
<li>A life insurance agent is required to have a licence from the applicable securities regulator or self-regulatory organization to sell securities such as stocks, bonds, options, commodities, ETFs or mutual funds.</li>
<li>Generally, each security type requires its own licence or distinct registration.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4353-mortgage-brokering">4.3.5.3 Mortgage brokering<a class="headerlink" href="#4353-mortgage-brokering" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage brokering requires a separate mortgage brokerage licence issued by a mortgage broker regulator.</li>
<li>Mortgage broker licences vary from province to province.</li>
<li>If the information provided is accurate and appropriate, a life agent generally does not need a mortgage brokerage licence to give mortgage referrals that provide limited information about a borrower to a potential lender (and vice versa).</li>
<li>Life agents who give mortgage referrals should work within the guidelines of the legislation regulating mortgage brokers.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>On the other hand, the following activities do not require any specific licences or registration:<ul>
<li>Acting as a deposit broker;</li>
<li>Acting as a financial planner.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4 id="4361-acting-as-a-deposit-broker">4.3.6.1 Acting as a deposit broker<a class="headerlink" href="#4361-acting-as-a-deposit-broker" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>In Canada, licences are not required for deposit brokers who work for banks or other deposit-taking institutions.</li>
<li>At present, there are no regulatory authorities overseeing these brokers’ activities.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4362-acting-as-a-financial-planner">4.3.6.2 Acting as a financial planner<a class="headerlink" href="#4362-acting-as-a-financial-planner" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Licensed life insurance agents do not require an additional licence to give clients advice regarding their financial circumstances.</li>
<li>However, it would be false for a life agent to call himself a financial planner.</li>
<li>Therefore, licensed life insurance agents must use caution when referring to themselves as financial planners, since each jurisdiction might have different rules regarding the use of the title financial planner.</li>
