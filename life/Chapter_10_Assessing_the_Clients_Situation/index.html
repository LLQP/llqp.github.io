<ul>
<li>The concepts in this chapter, as well as Chapter 11, will be illustrated using a case study focusing on Derek and Becky’s family, who are introduced below.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Derek and Becky’s Family Case Study</p>
<p>Derek and Becky are 47 and 38 years old respectively and they have been married for two years. Derek and his previous wife, Susan (aged 44), divorced four years ago, and they share joint custody of a son, Jordan (age 8).</p>
<p>Prior to marrying Derek, Becky was a single mother to Anya (aged 4). Derek formally adopted Anya when they got married. Derek and Becky have just had a child together; Robbie is two months old.</p>
<p>Derek and Becky are concerned about securing their financial future in the event that Derek dies, and they have approached a licensed life insurance agent to help them assess their insurance needs.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="101-assess-the-family-dynamics">10.1 Assess the family dynamics<a class="headerlink" href="#101-assess-the-family-dynamics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Many people use life insurance to provide financial support for their families upon their death. Agents need to understand their clients’ family dynamics before being able to advise how to best provide that support.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1011-current-spouse">10.1.1 Current spouse<a class="headerlink" href="#1011-current-spouse" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Many people use life insurance to provide financial support for their families in the event of their unexpected death.</li>
<li>There is an expectation that when people are married, either as legal or common-law spouses, the income earners in the family will arrange their affairs so that their spouse, and children, will be supported financially if they die.</li>
<li>The amount of support would depend on the nature of the relationship and the surviving beneficiary’s own financial capacity. For example, if there is a primary income earner (i.e., a single-income household), that individual would become the proposed life insured in a life insurance policy, and the spouse would be the beneficiary. In dual-income households, the surviving spouse may earn enough to be fully self-sufficient if one spouse dies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="10111-dependent-vs-self-sufficient">10.1.1.1 Dependent vs. self-sufficient<a class="headerlink" href="#10111-dependent-vs-self-sufficient" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A sole income earner for the family will usually need to replace his or her entire income for the surviving spouse’s use or to help cover childcare expenses if the spouse were to return to work.</li>

<p>Derek is employed full-time as the Vice President of Industrial Design for a manufacturing company, with take-home pay (i.e., income after taxes and deductions) of $8,400 per month. Becky currently stays home caring for Jordan, Anya and Robbie, but she intends to return to work as a human resources manager once Robbie is in school full-time, about six years from now. She anticipates that her take-home pay will be around $4,500 per month. However, Derek feels that, if he dies, he would prefer that Becky would not have to return to work until Robbie is 18, if at all possible. If Derek were to die today, the family would obviously suffer from the loss of his income and, even if Becky could return to work immediately upon his death, her income would be insufficient to maintain the family’s current standard of living.</p>

<li>A life insurance needs analysis must consider debt as well as assets.</li>
<li>Assets may be owned outright or a creditor may be involved. Debt obligations must be taken into consideration since they increase the amount of insurance coverage needed, as creditors may demand repayment upon the death of the borrower.

<li>A mortgage must be discharged (paid off) before the property can be bequeathed.</li>
<li>Spouses are usually co-owners and mortgagees of property. A surviving spouse must have the financial ability to continue mortgage payments.</li>
<li>Often, the life insured will want to ensure the surviving family can continue to own and live in the family home and when going through the insurance needs analysis will take this into consideration so that there is enough insurance to cover the amount owed on the mortgage.</li>
<li>If adequate life insurance is not in place, a survivor might have to sell their home because they could not make mortgage payments.</li>

<p class="admonition-title">Case Study</p>
<p>Derek has a number of assets that have the potential to result in a tax liability upon death, depending on the designated beneficiary. Any nonregistered property transferred to Becky can roll over, without triggering a taxable capital gain. Similarly, registered plans such as Derek’s TFSA, RRSPs and pension entitlement can transfer into registered plans for Becky if he designates her as the beneficiary.
Perhaps the biggest concern is the family cottage that he wants to pass on to the children. If he leaves the cottage to the children, either directly or through a trust, it could trigger a taxable capital gain of $175,000 based on its current value, calculated as:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a>(FMV of $600,000 – ACB of $250,000) × capital gains inclusion rate of 50%

<li>Spending patterns could change when the life insured dies. Less may be needed for certain expenses. For example, there may no longer be a need for two cars. And more may be needed for other expenses, for instance if the surviving spouse must now pay for the cost of childcare that was previously provided by the deceased spouse. How expenses will change if the life insured dies should be taken into consideration when analyzing insurance needs.

<p>With Derek’s take-home pay of $8,400 per month, they appear to have a small shortfall of $160 per month. However, Derek has indicated that until he receives his anticipated raise in two years, he is willing to use the after-tax investment income from his non-registered investments ( $7,200 per year or $600 per month) to cover the shortfall, as well as any required insurance premiums. While Becky and Derek both agree that it is important for her to remain home until Robbie is in school, they are looking forward to the day in about six years when she can return to work and bring in additional income.</p>

<li>If the business wants to protect itself from the loss of a key employee while also offering the employee access to a tax-deferred investment vehicle, the business would own the face amount, and the employee would own the cash value.
