<p>The biggest financial impact associated with Derek’s death would be the loss of his employment income, which currently amounts to $8,400 per month after-tax. His death may also result in the calling of their $350,196 mortgage and his $41,000 car loan, meaning that payment would be required in full, and the passing of the cottage to his children may result in a tax liability of $175,000.</p>

<li>From an insurance perspective, income replacement approach is reflected by the loss of employment income that would result from the death of an income earner.</li>
<li>This approach strives to replace that lost income and it assumes that as long as this income can be replaced, the surviving family will not experience a reduction in their standard of living.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Case Study</p>
<p>Derek is currently the sole income earner for the family. A life insurance needs analysis based on the income replacement approach would determine the value of the income that would be lost upon his death.</p>
<p>If the life insured played an essential non-income-earning role in the family, such as that of a caregiver, that individual’s contribution can be expressed in terms of what it would cost to replace that service.</p>
</div>

<li>Calculations using this approach results in a higher insurance need. This method is also referred to as the capital retention method because it assumes that the principal always remains intact. It is only the income generated by investing the principal that is used by the beneficiary and not the principal itself. Thus, the income stream lasts in perpetuity.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Case Study</p>
<p>Derek currently takes home $8,400 per month. Assuming a rate of return of 5%, the capitalized value of his lost income would be $2,016,000, calculated as:

<ul>
<li>Life insurance proceeds are not taxable when received. However, the resulting income from invested life insurance proceeds is taxable.</li>
<li>In terms of income replacement, lost income may be expressed either as a gross salary, or an after-tax amount, and the capitalization of income should be calculated on the same basis.</li>
<li>Thus, if the lost income is expressed as an after-tax amount, the interest rate used when calculating the capitalization of income should also be an after-tax amount, using an appropriate tax rate:<ul>
<li>The MTR should be used if the income amount is small, relative to the recipient’s other sources of income; and</li>
<li>The average tax rate should be used if the income amount is large.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Case Study</p>
<p>Derek has after-tax income of $8,400 per month or $100,800 per year. Therefore, the investment income earned on the death benefit needs to be calculated on an after-tax basis.</p>
<p>The after-tax rate of return is calculated as follows:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-2-1" name="__codelineno-2-1" href="#__codelineno-2-1"></a>    After-tax rate of return = rate of return × (1 – tax rate)

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-3-1" name="__codelineno-3-1" href="#__codelineno-3-1"></a>    3.75% = 5% × (1 – 25%)

This means that, using the replacement of income approach, adjusted for income taxes, Derek would need $2,688,000 in life insurance, calculated as:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-4-1" name="__codelineno-4-1" href="#__codelineno-4-1"></a>    $2,688,000 = ( $8,400/month × 12 months) ÷ 3.75%

<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Case Study</p>
<p>If Derek’s employment income increases at a rate of just 2% a year, the $8,400 per month he takes home today will increase to $10,240 in 10 years, which is a significant difference. As the inflation rate is 2% per year and the investment return is 5% per year, the inflation-adjusted rate of return is 2.9%, calculated as:
<img alt="picture 55" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dekingtt/statics/images/2022-01-06-11-333.png" />  </p>
<p>This means that using the replacement of income approach, adjusted for inflation, Derek would need $3,428,571 in life insurance, calculated as:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-5-1" name="__codelineno-5-1" href="#__codelineno-5-1"></a>    $3,428,571 = ( $8,400/month × 12 months) ÷ 2.94%.

<ul>
<li>The approach also assumes that the income being replaced is fixed over time. In reality, this is not the case as an individual’s salary usually increases over time.</li>
<li>The following calculation for capitalized value addresses the issue which takes inflation into account. It is called the inflation-adjusted rate of return.

Using the capital retention method, the capitalized value of Derek’s family’s income shortfall would be $1,927,719, calculated as:

<ul>
<li>The duration of each capital need helps determine whether permanent or term insurance is required.</li>
<li>Not all risks are lifelong, for example, a mortgage has a fixed term—usually 25 years. Term insurance or a term rider on a permanent policy can best address risks in which a duration can be specified.</li>
<li>Some risks create an obligation beyond the death of the life insured. For example, a disabled child may require care for his lifetime, which could extend for 30 years after the death of the life insured. The amount needed must be available when the life insured dies to ensure continued care.</li>
<li>The need to pay taxes that arise on death makes a good case for permanent insurance.</li>
<li>A proposed life insured may have a combination of risks for insurance to cover: some have a set term and some arise at death.</li>

<li>The tax liability on the inheritance of the cottage, which will be a permanent concern.</li>
<li>The donation to the hospice, which will be a permanent concern.</li>

<p>It would appear that Derek could use a combination of 20-year and/or 10-year term insurance policies to cover all needs except the tax liability on the cottage and the donation to the hospice. A cumulative cost comparison will be required to determine the most cost-effective option for him.</p>
<p>Whole life insurance would be more appropriate than universal life for the tax liability and the donation to the hospice because at this point in time, Derek is not looking for additional investment opportunities and cash flow is limited.</p>
<p>Note that while a joint-last-to-die policy is often used to cover the tax liability on a family asset being left to the children, it is not appropriate in this case because the cottage is to be held in trust for the children if Derek dies; there is no opportunity to roll it over to Becky and defer the taxable capital gain until her death. Therefore, all of Derek’s life insurance should be on a single life basis.</p>
<p>The coverage on Becky and children should be some form of term life insurance, and can be done via an individual policy on Becky with a child life rider, or as a family life rider on one of Derek’s policies. Both options will be compared shortly.</p>

<li>Of the other financial needs, two of them will end within the next 10 years ( $132,000 in child support for Jordan and the car loan of $41,000). A $180,000 Term-10 policy should be used to cover these needs.</li>

<li>For the cottage liability and hospice donation, the $200,000 of whole life insurance will cost $650 per month.</li>
<li>Derek has total term insurance needs of $560,000 ( $760,000 – $100,000 (cottage) – $100,000 (hospice donation)):<ul>
<li>$180,000 of coverage for his shorter term needs (i.e., child support and car loans will end within 10 years);</li>
<li>$380,000 ( $760,000 – $200,000 – $180,000) in longer-term needs (i.e., spousal support, mortgage and Becky’s income shortfall will end in about 20 years).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So should Derek use renewable 10-year term (T-10), 20-year term (T-20), or a combination of both to cover these term needs? Performing a cumulative cost analysis can help as shown in the following table.</p>
<p>At this point it is necessary to compare $560,000 of T-10 (Option A) or T-20 (Option B) renewable, dropping to $380,000 of coverage upon renewal, when his needs will have dropped. Remember, the premiums upon renewal will have already been set when he buys the policy. The cumulative cost analysis is provided below:
<img alt="picture 65" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dekingtt/statics/images/2022-01-07-00-790.png" />  </p>
<p>Clearly if only one policy is to be used, the T-20 policy (Option B) works out better than the T-10 policy (Option A) in the long run, with a cumulative cost of $67,680 over 20 years, compared to $105,624 for the T-10 policy. However, notice the cumulative costs for each policy after the first 10 years, before the coverage drops to $380,000. At 10 years, the T-10 policy is the clear winner, with a cumulative cost-to-date of $22,176, compared to $40,320 for the T-20 policy. This reversal suggests that a combination of policies may be in Derek’s best interests.
At this point a cumulative cost comparison is useful between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a T-20 policy for the entire $560,000, dropping to $380,000 after 10 years (Option B as shown in the Table above); and</li>
<li>Using a combination of a T-10 policy for the shorter-term needs of $180,000, along with a T-20 policy of $380,000 to cover the longer-term needs (Option C, shown below).
<img alt="picture 66" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dekingtt/statics/images/2022-01-07-00-940.png" />  </li>
</ul>
<p>The cumulative cost of this combination of policies over 20 years is only $61,850, compared to the $69,120 over 20 years for a single T-20 policy, or savings of about 10%.</p>
<p>So given that Derek has 2 very distinct coverage periods (e.g., 10 years and 20 years) and is certain that some of his insurance needs are short term only, then a combination of T-10 and T-20 policies will be more cost effective in the long run. However, if he feels that his insurance needs may remain the same or even increase in the future, he may want to consider covering the entire amount with a single T-20 policy.</p>
<p>Note that while spreadsheets help illustrate the point, the cumulative cost comparisons can usually be done very simply using a calculator, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Option A</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Single $560,000 renewable T-10 policy, dropping to $380,000 after 10 years</li>
<li>1<sup>st</sup> 10 years = $560,000 ÷ $100,000 × $33/month × 12 months × 10 years = $22,176</li>
<li>2<sup>nd</sup> 10 years = $380,000 ÷ $100,000 × $183/month × 12 months × 10 years = $83,448</li>
<li>Cumulative cost over 20 years = $22,176 + $ 83,448 = $105,624</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>- Replace Derek’s existing $250,000 policy?</strong></p>
<p>Derek has an existing $250,000 Term-10 policy that is due to renew in 2 years. He was shocked to realize how much the premiums will increase upon renewal (from $250 per year to $1,125 per year). Derek heard that it is often cheaper to shop for a new policy, rather than renew the old one, so he asked his agent to determine the cost of replacing his old policy.</p>
<p>The results are provided in the table below, which shows that Derek would be better off keeping his existing policy. The reason the results were disappointing for Derek was that he became a smoker after the original policy was issued. The old policy will remain valid, even though Derek is now a smoker. This is one of the reasons premiums jump so much upon renewal because the life insured may no longer be in the fine health he was when the policy was first issued.

<p class="admonition-title">Case Study (cont.)</p>
<p><strong>Insurance for Becky and the Children</strong></p>
<p>Derek wants to obtain $150,000 of life insurance coverage on Becky’s life, and $10,000 on each of the children. This can be accomplished in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buying a stand-alone $150,000 Term-10 insurance policy on Becky, with a $10,000 child-life rider, which would have a total monthly premium of $23.54;</li>
<li>Adding a family life rider to his whole-life insurance policy, with $150,000 of Term-10 coverage on Becky and $10,000 each on the children, which would have a total monthly premium of $19.04.</li>
</ul>
<p>The stand-alone policy is more expensive because it has a separate policy administration fee; this fee is not charged when the coverage is added as a rider to Derek’s whole life policy.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total costs</strong></li>
<li>The total monthly cost of the recommended additional insurance is $956, as shown below
<img alt="picture 71" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dekingtt/statics/images/2022-01-07-00-502.png" />  </li>
</ul>
<p>This exceeds the $440 the family currently has in available cash flow, so they will have some decisions to make. A few of the possibilities include:
- Reducing the amount of coverage, and accepting the fact that Becky may have to return to work before Robbie turns 18, and Derek will not be able to leave $100,000 to his favourite charity;
- Obtaining term insurance with a conversion option for the tax liability on the cottage and the hospice donation, which would allow Derek to convert to permanent insurance once cash flow permits;
- Scaling back on their other expenditures to increase the amount of cash flow they can devote to life insurance;
- Depending on the policy of their insurance company, Derek may be able to apply for a decrease in premiums if he is able to stop smoking for at least a year.</p>

<p>With his $180,000-term life insurance policy, Derek could name Becky the beneficiary of $50,000 in order to reimburse his car loan and a testamentary trust as the beneficiary of $130,000, to provide child support for Jordan, with any remaining amount to be paid to Becky when Jordan turns 18.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The agent should also encourage the applicant to specify one or more contingent beneficiaries.

<p>Anne-Marie is an avid photographer and frequent traveller.

<li>Once this contestability period has expired, the policy is said to be incontestable and the insurance company cannot cancel the policy for any reason other than missed premiums, or fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
<li>Fraud voids a policy at any point it is discovered.</li>
