<li>The death of a business owner or employee who is key to a business can have a significant negative effect on the overall success of the business. These effects may include the following:<ul>
<li>Loss of skills;</li>
<li>Creditor demands;</li>
<li>Family interference;</li>
<li>Equality for family members; and</li>
<li>Capital gains tax.</li>

<ul>
<li>Many businesses have an employee, or a combination of employees, whose skills are vital to the business. The employee(s) may have long-term knowledge of the business, expertise, or ideas that others do not have – and this knowledge and experience may also be difficult to replace.</li>
<li>Such a person is instrumental to business success. This is the person who is called a “key person,” or “key employee.” Examples of “key persons” may include highly skilled craftspeople, charismatic salespeople, or an influential vice president.</li>
<li>Death of a key employee can bring about the collapse of a business if revenues decline as a result of the death.</li>

<li>To continue the example above, if Farid dies unexpectedly, his wife Gohar would inherit his shares.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those inheritors may not be familiar with the business and may have unrealistic expectations for profitability and distribution of revenue.<ul>
<li>To continue the example, Farid never revealed any details about the business to Gohar, who expects dividends to be paid quarterly. However, if dividends are paid quarterly, money will not be available in the business to buy more inventory. Without inventory, the business will be ruined.</li>

<li>An inheritor may be willing to sell their newly acquired share of the business but at a selling price that is unreasonable and unrealistic for the other owners to pay.<ul>
<li>To continue the example, Gohar may be willing to sell the share of the business she inherited from Farid. However, with no knowledge of the business, she sets a price that is too high. The remaining shareholders refuse to meet her price. Family hostility ensues.</li>

<li>Shares of a business may roll over to a spouse without tax consequences.</li>
<li>Shares received by any other person may be subject to capital gains tax. In the case of an active and prosperous business, where shares are not left to a surviving spouses, this can result in a significant tax bill payable at the death of the business owner (on their final tax return).</li>

<ul>
<li>A sole proprietorship is the least formal structure of the three structures that are available.</li>
<li>It has one owner who personally pays all expenses and personally earns all income.</li>
<li>The sole proprietor is usually the operator of the business, and the death of the sole proprietor could have a catastrophic impact on the business.</li>
<li>The business itself is not a separate entity from the sole proprietor and has no adjusted cost base; and assets of the business, such as product inventory, become part of the owner’s personal estate at death.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="822-partnerships">8.2.2 Partnerships<a class="headerlink" href="#822-partnerships" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A partnership is a business that is owned by two or more people who have the common purpose of earning a profit.</li>
<li>Each owner has a partnership interest.</li>
<li>There are several forms a partnership interest can take. They are:<ul>
<li>A partner who receives a share of partnership income and is jointly and severally responsible for partnership debt and liabilities;</li>
<li>A passive or silent partner who participates financially but is otherwise uninvolved;</li>
<li>A general partner who is required in a limited partnership to be personally responsible for partnership debt and liabilities;</li>
<li>A limited partner who is found in a limited partnership and has no responsibility for partnership debt and liabilities (note that a partnership must always have at least one general partner; a partnership cannot be composed entirely of limited partners).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A partnership interest has some of the same attributes as a corporate share:<ul>
<li>It has a value;</li>
<li>It has an adjusted cost base;</li>
<li>It can have a capital gain or loss;</li>
<li>It can be bought, sold, or bequeathed (given through a will) on death of the partner;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>From a tax perspective, each partner must report their share of net partnership income on their personal tax return.</li>
<li>Because a partnership interest may give rise to a capital gain upon the death of a partner, a tax liability may also arise at the partner’s death. The impact of this tax bill can be devastating unless it is anticipated through careful planning.</li>

<li>A corporation is a legal entity in which shares of the corporation are created.</li>
<li>The individuals who receive or buy those shares are the shareholders of the corporation.</li>
<li>The corporation is separate and distinct from the shareholders, who are not personally liable for the debts and liabilities of the corporation (unless they personally guaranteed those debts).</li>
<li>Shareholders, if they are directors of the corporation, may be held personally liable for the company’s income taxes and any amounts that are deducted at source from payroll (such as Employment Insurance and Canada Pension Plan premiums, and employee income tax withholdings).</li>
<li>Income received by the corporation may be paid to shareholders as salary if the shareholder is employed by the corporation and as stock dividends to all shareholders.</li>
<li>Like policy dividends, stock dividends are not guaranteed.</li>
<li>The corporation’s shareholders do not report the company’s net income on their tax return. Instead, that net income is taxed in the corporation, and after-tax corporate profits are either retained in the corporation, increasing share value; or are paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends.</li>
<li>Shares have value and an adjusted cost base that can lead to a capital gain or loss when they are sold. As with a partnership interest, the resulting tax liability can be significant and should be considered during planning.</li>

<li>Shares of a private corporation are not publicly traded. They are issued to employees and others with an interest in the business.</li>
<li>A Canadian-Controlled Private Corporation (CCPC) is a private corporation that resides in Canada, is Canadian-controlled, and is not controlled by a public corporation.<ul>
<li>CCPC shares are also called qualified small business corporation shares because they may qualify for a capital gains exemption. There are specific rules that set out how a company may qualify for a capital gains exemption, but these rules are beyond the scope of this discussion.</li>

<ul>
<li>For the purpose of this Module, the most important tax attribute of a CCPC is that, upon actual or deemed disposition, the shares may be eligible for the lifetime capital gains exemption (LCGE). The LCGE for a CCPC is currently set at $883,384 for 2020 and is to be indexed annually for inflation. A taxpayer can use the LCGE to eliminate or offset capital gains realized upon the disposition of qualified shares in a CCPC, a family farm or a family fishing business.</li>
<li>The formula is:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-1-1" name="__codelineno-1-1" href="#__codelineno-1-1"></a>(Capital gain – LCGE) × 50% = taxable capital gain

<p>Gene was the sole shareholder of his sportswear manufacturing company, Kiliman, which is a CCPC. When he died, the business had a fair market value (FMV) of $2,400,000 and an adjusted cost base (ACB) of $200,000. He left the business to his daughter, Yvonne.
This deemed disposition resulted in a capital gain of $2,200,000.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-2-1" name="__codelineno-2-1" href="#__codelineno-2-1"></a>    Capital gain = $2,400,000 – $200,000 = $2,200,000

Gene has never made use of the LCGE, so $883,384 (in 2020) of this capital gain is exempt from tax, leaving his estate with a taxable capital gain of $658,308.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-3-1" name="__codelineno-3-1" href="#__codelineno-3-1"></a>    Taxable capital gain = ( $2,200,000 – $883,384) × 50% = $658,308

<ul>
<li>A split-dollar arrangement is a method of sharing the cost and benefits of life insurance between two parties, such as a corporation and its key person.</li>
<li>Typically, the agreement is between two parties and is used when more than one person or entity requires the benefits that can be provided by a life insurance policy.</li>
<li>In common split-dollar arrangements, a life insurance policy could be jointly owned by a key employee and the corporation for which they work.</li>
<li>The specific arrangement could be structured in several different ways. For example, the employee could own the death benefit while the company owns and controls the cash value of the policy or vice-versa.<ul>
<li>If it is a UL policy, the corporation could own the face amount and the key person own the death benefit greater than the original face amount; which would be paid to a beneficiary of the key person upon the death of the key employee.</li>
<li>Alternatively, the corporation could own the death benefit up to the original face amount while the employee owns the policy’s cash value and any death benefit in excess of the original face amount.</li>
<li>This is a most common arrangement for key person insurance, as it provides the corporation with access to the death benefit in the event of the death of the key person while the employee is able to benefit from a tax-deferred investment vehicle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each party to a split-dollar arrangement pays a portion of the premiums in a way that recognizes their separate economic interests in the policy. In the final example, in which the corporation owns the death benefit up to the original face amount, the company’s share of premiums will be tied to the reasonable cost of comparable term insurance coverage, while the employee pays the balance of the premium costs.</li>

<li>The administrative practice of Canada Revenue Agency has been to recognize the premium allocation between the employee and the corporation as a reflection of the fair market value of their respective interests in the insurance contract.</li>
<li>Upon retirement or termination of employment, the ownership interest in the death benefit could be transferred to the departing employee.</li>
<li>Depending on the fair market value (FMV) of the policy, the transfer might result in a taxable benefit for the employee.</li>

<ul>
<li>An arrangement known as “criss-cross insurance” is often used to fund cross-purchase buy-sell agreements. With a criss-cross arrangement, each party to the buy-sell agreement buys life insurance on the other parties to the agreement, in an amount sufficient to cover their purchase obligation upon that party’s death.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Recall the earlier example where Bob, Calvin and Dylan each own 100 shares, which are currently worth $10,000 per share. They recently executed a buy-sell agreement which says that, if any one of them dies, the survivors will buy his shares for their current share value as determined by the company’s financial statements. The agreement specifies that each associate will purchase life insurance on the lives of the other parties.</p>
<p>So Bob would buy $500,000 of life insurance on Calvin and Dylan, which would be sufficient to buy 50 shares at the current value of $10,000 per share.</p>
<p>Bob is the youngest of the three owners. He is only 32 years old and in excellent health. Dylan, however, is 54 years old, overweight and a smoker, with a history of hypertension. Bob will pay much more for $500,000 of coverage on Dylan’s life than Dylan will pay for $500,000 of coverage on Bob’s life. Bob doesn’t think this is fair, considering the fact that the death benefit is the same for both of them. Dylan, however, maintains that it is fair because Bob is far more likely to collect on the insurance than he is.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Because the insurance is not being used to secure a loan for business or investment purposes, the premiums are not deductible to either the associates or the business. However, the death benefit is tax-free.</li>
<li>One of the disadvantages of criss-cross insurance is that there may be significant differences in the premiums for the coverage required on each party, depending on their age and health.</li>

<p>Jack and Alfred each own 50% of the 200 shares of Jackal Inc., a frozen dessert company. They implemented a buy-sell agreement funded with criss-cross insurance. Jack died shortly thereafter. The overall process would look like this:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>From a tax perspective, the deceased owner is deemed to have disposed of his business interest for its fair market value (FMV) just prior to death. This will trigger a capital gain on the deceased’s final tax return, unless he can shelter some or all of the capital gain with the lifetime capital gains exemption (LCGE) available for qualifying small business shares. The LCGE for 2020 is $883,384. The surviving associate(s) use the tax-free death benefit they received when the owner died in order to acquire the units or shares from his estate.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Instead of the criss-cross arrangement, the business could buy life insurance on its owners. It will be the policy beneficiary.</li>
<li>This arrangement has several potential benefits over policies purchased by the individual owners, as follows:</li>
<li>When the business is the owner of the policies, it will be clear to all owners that premiums are being paid.</li>
<li>The business pays tax at a lower rate than individuals, plus individuals are saved the premium expense.</li>
<li>If there are more than two owners, it will generally be more efficient and more cost-effective for the business to own policies on each associate, compared to each owner purchasing policies on the other owners.</li>
<li>If the cost of insuring each associate varies significantly between the associates (due to reasons such as age and health status), a business-owned option will ensure that the costs are shared equally.</li>
<li>Note that if a buy-sell agreement will be funded by business-owned insurance and there are only two owners, a joint first-to-die policy may be appropriate.</li>

<h4 id="8441-role-of-the-capital-dividend-account-cda">8.4.4.1 Role of the capital dividend account (CDA)<a class="headerlink" href="#8441-role-of-the-capital-dividend-account-cda" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Business-owned insurance can be used to fund both cross-purchase buy-sell agreements and share redemption plans. In order to understand how business-owned insurance can be an effective business strategy, it is first necessary to understand how the Capital Dividend Account works.</li>
<li>The capital dividend account is a notional account, which only keeps track of inputs and outputs for tax purposes.</li>
<li>A private corporation uses its CDA to record amounts it receives on a tax-free basis, such as the tax-free 50% of capital gains and some or all of the death benefits received from a life insurance policy.</li>
<li>When the account has a positive balance, the corporation can pay a tax-free capital dividend to its shareholders.</li>
<li>When the corporation pays out a capital dividend, the CDA balance is reduced by the same amount.</li>
<li>Note that only the portion of the death benefit that exceeds the policy’s ACB is credited to the CDA, and ultimately paid out as a tax-free capital dividend. The remainder (i.e., an amount equal to the policy’s ACB) is taxable to the corporation.</li>
<li>In the case of a term policy, the ACB is zero, which means that the full death benefit can be credited to the CDA. However, for whole life or UL policies, a portion of the death benefit equal to the policy’s ACB is in fact taxable to the corporation.</li>
<li>Recall from Section G2 and G3 policies that the ACB of G3 policies tends to grow faster than for G2 policies in the early years, and it takes longer for that ACB to reduce to zero. This ACB pattern is beneficial for individual policyholders who surrender their policies prior to death of the life insured because it reduces their policy gain. However, it is less favourable for corporate-owned policies because a greater portion of the death benefit ends up being taxable.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If a cross-purchase agreement is funded by corporate-owned insurance, usually the corporation is named as the beneficiary of the policy. When one shareholder dies, the surviving owner(s) purchase the shares from his estate, often using a promissory note. The insurance company will pay the death benefit to the corpora-tion, which will credit the amount to its capital dividend account. The surviving shareholder(s) will then direct the corporation to pay them a capital dividend, which they will use to pay off the promissory note.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In the case of a share redemption plan, the company and the shareholders are all parties to the buy-sell agreement. The company buys life insurance on all of the shareholders, naming itself as the beneficiary.

<li>Jack dies, and his shares transfer to his estate.</li>
<li>The insurance company pays the tax-free death benefit to Jackal Inc., which is credited to its CDA.</li>
<li>Jackal Inc. uses the funds to redeem the shares from Jack’s estate, cancelling the said shares, reduc-ing the number of shares outstanding to 100.</li>
<li>Alfred still owns the remaining 100 shares, which represents 100% of the company.</li>
