In brief, A&S insurance relieves insured individuals of the burdens of medical expenses or income loss arising from illness, injury or necessary medical treatment not covered by the provincial health insurance plans 1.1 For Individuals and Their Families \u00b6 A&S insurance protects an individual or a family from the burdens of medical expenses and income loss arising from: A health crisis due to physical injury; An illness that prevents an individual from working; Increased medical expenses from a health condition; and The need to pay for long-term care. 1.1.1 Financial goals of individuals and their families \u00b6 The majority of families have similar principal financial objectives that require regular cash flow as well supplementary cash to be invested for the long term although the amounts and requirements will vary family to family. 1.1.1.1 Wealth accumulation \u00b6 Setting up an emergency fund, equivalent to three to six months\u2019 current living expenses, is an important and immediate need that must be set up once primary needs (i.e., food, accommodation, clothing, means of travel, etc.) have been provided. It provides a financial cushion against unforeseen events. After establishing an emergency fund, additional money not needed for living expenses can be saved for short and long-term goals. Such goals can include wealth accumulation, investing in a portfolio to provide current income or growth for retirement funds, and meeting family needs. 1.1.1.2 Retirement income \u00b6 Retirement requires a source of income. Retirement income pays the costs of living as a retiree. All retirees have one thing in common\u2014the requirement of income in one degree or another. It is often highly desirable to have more income available than simple needs require. Retirement income comes from many sources such as: Government pension plans \u2013 Canada/Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plans (CPP and QPP) and Old Age Security (OAS); Employment pension plans; Private pension plans \u2013 Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs); Non-registered investments; Inheritances; Part-time employment or self-employment; Liquidation of assets. Some of those sources do not require input from the individual (e.g., receiving an inheritance). The majority of retirement income sources result from saving and investing while working for many years prior to retirement - such as a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP). If disability, sickness or economic downturns interrupt the ability to work, income may not be available to save for retirement needs and wants. The agent plays a key role in assessing and determining which life insurance product best suits the needs of clients to ensure their financial protection. This is particularly important in the area of disability where products are needed to replace income during periods of disability. 1.1.1.3 Family needs \u00b6 Families have many needs for income, both to pay the cost of basic living and the extras, such as holidays. For example, tuition for children\u2019s education, orthodontics, vacations, etc., all must be provided for before retirement. Wants and needs change over time; some, such as care for a disabled child demand special attention for a lifetime. It is very important that families generate income and set aside savings to meet these continual family needs prior to retirement and prior to (or concurrent with) investing for wealth accumulation. 1.1.2 Financial risks that threaten individuals and their families \u00b6 In order to meet the financial objectives outlined in the previous section, the client must be able to generate enough income and savings over time. There are many risks that could interrupt family financial goals, such as: Unexpected expenses; Loss of income or savings; Lower standard of living; Inflation; Longevity; and Debt. 1.1.2.1 Unexpected expenses \u00b6 A budget should ideally help clients prepare for their future financial responsibilities in terms of their current income. Clients vary in their ability to make a realistic budget as well as stick to it. Costs that would arise as a result of an accident or medical condition are not usually planned as part of a family budget. Medical issues can create an unexpected expense or, if an issue is already being accommodated, can increase the cost of the expense. Both are detrimental to the budget and its objectives. Example 1 Sandra was riding her bike to work when she was hit by a truck. She was hospitalized for seven months and, due to a severe concussion, may never practise law again. She also has a need for at-home caregivers, physiotherapy, and many prescription drugs. Her personal savings are being rapidly depleted by this unexpected expense. The possibility of having to sell her house and move the family into an apartment is looming. Example 2 Darren suffers from depression. His family manages the cost of his prescriptions. As his depression worsens, Darren needs new drugs that are 10 times more expensive. His family finds it difficult to manage the increased cost. 1.1.2.2 Loss of income \u00b6 When an individual begins a career, financial security is usually fully dependent on generating more income to save and invest rather than just for living expenses. It may be impossible to save for future needs when income is lost due to job loss, injury, illness or disability. 1.1.2.3 Loss of savings \u00b6 When income is lost, savings may provide a stop-gap between what is being received and living expenses. If savings are depleted, there could be a permanent effect on the financial situation, or there could be a temporary hardship while more income is directed towards rebuilding savings. 1.1.2.4 Lower standard of living \u00b6 A lower standard of living is a result of other risks resulting in personal financial loss (such as the loss of income, loss of assets, loss of savings, etc.). The family\u2019s diminishing financial circumstances could cause them to sell their cars, downgrade to a smaller home, eliminate family vacations, and so forth. This \u201cdomino effect\u201d could be avoided if the client has A&S insurance. This lower standard of living could also affect the family psychologically, deterring them from future productivity, earning the same income again and restoring their standard of living. 1.1.2.5 Inflation \u00b6 Inflation is a general increase in prices. The increase in prices results in the decline in the purchasing value of money. Example Using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a guide, for example, a \u201cbasket\u201d of goods that cost $100 in 2000 cost $143.41 just 20 years later in 2020\u2014an increase of 43%\u2014during a period of historically low inflation. Looking at the long-term, $100 worth of goods bought in 1920 costs $1,173 one century later. Inflation fluctuates. For example, using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Canada\u2019s recent past, inflation has been reasonably low (1.95% in 2019) but further back in Canadian history it was much higher (12.12% in 1982). An income that does not keep pace with inflation will have less purchasing power. In other words, salaries have to increase simultaneously with inflation for the worker to maintain his standard of living. Individuals on fixed incomes, such as retirees, face this problem because their salaries do not increase with inflation. An important tool for calculating inflation in Canada is the Inflation Calculator found on the Bank of Canada website: http://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/ . 1.1.2.6 Longevity \u00b6 Life expectancy in Canada has greatly improved since the early 20 th century. The life expectancy at birth for men has increased by 20.5 years, from 58.8 years in 1920-1922 to 79.3 years in 2009-2011. During the same period, the life expectancy of women increased by 23.0 years, from 60.6 years to 83.6 years. In 1920-1922, Canadian men who had lived to age 65 could expect to live for 13 more years, and women could expect to live for 13.5 more years (to age 78.0 and 78.5 respectively). In 2009-2011, 65-year-old men were expected to live until they were 83.8, while 65-year-old women were expected to live until the age of 86.7. This means that from 1920-1922 to 2009-2011, the life expectancies of 65-year-olds increased by 5.8 years for men and 8.2 years for women. Since the age of retirement has remained virtually unchanged at age 65 for many years, this means people spend more years of their lives in retirement than previously. There is a risk of outliving one\u2019s money if the amount of retirement income needed is underestimated. In other words, the money runs out before the life ends. Therefore, clients need to acquire more retirement assets to avoid outliving their money. This need is heightened because seniors often incur more health care costs due to health problems or potentially needing extra care at home or in an institution (i.e., a nursing home). For example, it is increasingly rare for seniors who need medical assistance to live with their families. They usually go to live in a retirement home, nursing home or chronic care facility (depending on their needs). These facilities can be extremely expensive. They can drain the seniors\u2019 savings and leave them in a position where they are dependent on the government or their children. These factors underscore the importance of clients saving for retirement while they are able to earn an income. These factors also demonstrate that retirees without enough savings to support their costs in retirement leave their children with little or no estate. 1.1.2.7 Debt \u00b6 Debt reduces net worth. It refers to the value of a person\u2019s assets minus his liabilities. Debt can destroy financial plans and objectives. In 2017, total household debt in Canada rose to $1.4 trillion in mortgage debt and $630 billion in credit card debt. Carrying costs\u2014or interest\u2014is the biggest concern when it comes to debt. Credit card debt is especially worrisome due to the particularly high-interest rate that is charged on unpaid balances (18\u201324% or higher). If income is interrupted and debt cannot be paid, an individual may face difficult decisions and severe and long-lasting repercussions. Repaying the debt with its extra interest charges may create a financial strain. Debt servicing typically comes out of current income. A client\u2019s failure to take care of his debt could result in higher interest payments as well as\u2014in extreme situations\u2014in lawsuits, foreclosure and bankruptcy. Therefore, it is very important to put in place insurance to replace the client\u2019s own capacity to generate income or cover medical costs. Many Canadians entering into retirement have substantial debt which can impede the long-term sustainability of their retirement plans. 1.1.3 Personal risks that threaten individuals and their families \u00b6 Personal health risks also pose a critical potential risk in interrupting financial plans and compromising financial security. These include: Likelihood of disability; Loss of independence; Costs of long-term care. 1.1.3.1 Likelihood of disability \u00b6 Disability in Canada refers to when an individual has difficulty performing tasks due to a long-term condition or health-related problem and experiences a limitation in their day-to-day life. The rate of disability increases with age. According to the 2017 Canadian Survey on Disability by Statistics Canada: About 6.2 million Canadians over the age of 15 reported a disability; More than 540,000 youths aged 15 to 24 years (13%) had one or more disabilities; This compared with 20% or 3.7 million working age adults (aged 25 to 64) and 38% or 2 million seniors aged 65 and over had at least one disability; Women (24%) have a higher prevvalance of disability than men (20%) and this was the case for all age groups; and In 2017, 57% of Canadians with disabilities had a \u201cless severe\u201d disability (classified as having a mild or moderate disability) and 43% had a \u201cmore severe\u201d disability (classified as having a severe or very severe disability). In all cases, the disability was severe enough to limit thier activities to some degree. 1.1.3.2 Loss of independence and costs of long-term care \u00b6 As people are living longer and receiving better health care, more of them are living with serious cognitive (such as Alzheimer\u2019s) and physical (such as Parkinson\u2019s disease) medical conditions. This leaves individuals unable to care for themselves and needing long-term, institutionalized care . The cost of assisted care for adults is high\u2014such an expense amortized over years of care can seriously erode the value of an estate. Example Daniel\u2019s long-term care facility costs $8,600/month. When he went into care at age 62 with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s, he had pension income of $3,200/month and a $1 million estate. The current rate of expenditure shows his estate will be depleted in about 15 years. The pension income is insufficient for the cost of the facility. What will happen to Daniel when the money runs out? 1.1.4 Needs met by accident and sickness insurance for individuals \u00b6 A&S insurance can provide needed funds to buy time for employees, the self-employed, business owners and their families. A&S insurance provides security and protects the individual\u2019s: Income; Savings; Assets. The section looks at how A&S insurance protects income, savings, and assets. 1.1.4.1 Protection for income \u00b6 Disability income protection is one of the most common forms of A&S insurance. The coverage replaces the income of a sick or injured worker who is no longer able to work. Regular income from working is replaced by income from insurance after a specified waiting period following the onset of disability. No benefits are payable during the waiting period. The policy limits the benefit to a specified period or age or to when the disabled returns to work. Example Raoul is an independent contractor working in the plumbing trade, earning $80,000 a year. In order to financially protect his family in the event that he becomes disabled unable to work, he has taken out a disability income replacement (A&S) insurance policy. The policy has a 90-day (three-month) waiting period, a monthly benefit of $4,200 and a five-year benefit period. If Raoul was to be injured and unable to work, after waiting for three months, the policy would begin to pay him $4,200 a month for up to five years, to replace income lost due to disability. 1.1.4.2 Protection for savings \u00b6 As discussed, one of the primary financial goals of an individual is the accumulation of both short-term and long-term savings. Unexpected occurrences can cause a decrease in both short-term and long-term savings. Extended health insurance (another form of A&S insurance) is insurance to protect savings from expenses caused by sickness or disability. This greatly reduces the financial impact of many of these risks by providing the insured individual with cash for medical costs and to replace income. For example, travel insurance is a form of extended health insurance that pays the costs of sickness for a Canadian travelling in the U.S. Example Mrs. Johnson, who runs a consulting sole proprietorship business, was injured in a slip and fall accident in January and was unable to work for 8 months. As a result, she was unable to earn her regular $5,000 a month of consulting fees for those months, resulting in a nearly 50% reduction in family income. The Johnsons\u2019 son was hit in the mouth with a puck in a recreational hockey game and required over $10,000 of dental reconstructive surgery. And the Johnsons\u2019 daughter developed a serious viral infection requiring 10 days of hospital treatment in a private room, at a cost of $125 a day over and above what the provincial health plan pays. Fortunately, the family has extensive A&S insurance coverage, both private and through Mr. Johnson\u2019s group plan where he works. All of their daughter\u2019s $1,250 of extra hospital expenses were covered under the group plan, as was $5,000 of their son\u2019s dental expenses. And Mrs. Johnson has a disability income replacement plan that paid her $3,000 a month for five of the eight months that she was off work, a total of $15,000. Without adequate insurance coverage, the Johnsons\u2019 savings would have been reduced by $21,250 ( $1,250 + $5,000 + $15,000). 1.1.4.3 Protection for assets \u00b6 Long-term care insurance (another form of A&S insurance) is insurance to protect assets. Therefore, estate value is not eroded because assets remain in place to ultimately pass on to heirs and beneficiaries. Most Canadians save for their retirement, although the amount saved varies for each individual. The general intent is that the savings not spent during retirement are passed down to their heirs. However, health issues prevalent among seniors often drain retirement savings and estate assets, leaving a depleted legacy to pass onto heirs. Long-term care and critical illness insurance both protect this from happening by maintaining the value of the estate through providing benefits to offset much of these costs. Example Eudora, age 69, never earned a large salary and had no pension plan at her place of business. However, she did manage to accumulate about $250,000 in RRSPs and non-registered investments, in addition to her $150,000 home. To date, she has been able to manage on her $1,250 a month ( $15,000 a year) in government benefits and some interest and dividends from her investments. Eudora just discovered that she has a degenerative disease that will force her to move into a nursing home, at a cost of $2,750 a month ( $33,000 a year). Despite her health problems, Eudora has a normal life expectancy of age 85 (16 more years). The shortfall in her income versus the cost of the nursing home would require Eudora to liquidate $18,000 a year of her assets ( $33,000 \u2013 $15,000), reducing her estate by about $290,000 over her lifetime ( $18,000 \u00d7 16 years): money she had planned to leave to her three grandnieces. Fortunately, Eudora took out a long-term care policy when she was in her mid-50s. The policy will cover $1,000 of her monthly expenses ( $12,000 annually), reducing the erosion of her estate to less than $100,000 over her lifetime (( $18,000 \u2013 $12,000) \u00d7 16 years = $96,000), and enabling her to still leave a substantial legacy for her family. 1.2 For Business Owners \u00b6 The needs and goals of business owners that require protection are, in many ways, similar to those of individuals and their families. That is because the business owner does not exist in a vacuum: he is both an individual and, often, a member of a family. The sections below describe goals, risks and needs of business owners as they relate to accident and sickness. 1.2.1 Goals \u00b6 Generally, private business owners have similar goals which can potentially fluctuate over time. These goals are often directly related to goals that the business owner holds as an individual such as: Business profitability (income protection); Business succession (capital protection); Sale at fair market value (protection of estate value). These goals will be discussed in the following section. 1.2.1.1 Business profitability \u00b6 Initially, survival is the main goal of a new business owner. Once the business takes off, profitability and growth become the principal goals of a business. Profitability is key for a business to succeed long-term. Continuity is central to business profitability. 1.2.1.2 Business succession \u00b6 Business succession refers to the passing on of a business to a successor (family member, employee, etc.). Many business owners hope to pass their business down to their children. This is often not possible due to poor planning even if the children are willing to take over the business. In cases where the children are willing to take over, a lack of proper preparation can result in the business failing before any transition can be affected. A disability or illness of the business owner could ruin his plans to pass the business along through succession; there could be nothing left to pass if he has not been able to work and keep up the revenue stream and operations. Business overhead insurance\u2014an A&S product\u2014is a possible solution for this need. See more in Chapter 5. 1.2.1.3 Sale at fair market value \u00b6 Often the children cannot or do not want to take over a business. In these circumstances, the best-case scenario is to plan in advance and sell the business at its fair market value. A fire sale refers to when the sale of a business is sudden and unplanned. In this case, competitors or possible successors seek to benefit from the situation by buying the business for much less than what it is actually worth. Ideally, business owners should plan in advance and find a suitable buyer to purchase their business. They make a deal with the buyer to buy their business at a fair market value using the appropriate legal tool (i.e., a buy-sell agreement). This ensures that the buyer has enough funds when it comes time to buy the business. Life insurance addresses the need to sell a business at fair market value if the business owner or partner dies. Disability income insurance addresses the need to sell a business at fair market value if the business owner or partner is disabled. Chapter 5 of this manual looks at how accident and sickness insurance helps to secure the needed funding and accurate legal documentation to ensure that a disabled business owner can acquire the business at a fair price. 1.2.2 Business risk \u00b6 The success (or failure) of a business can be due to many different internal and external factors. Risk refers to the chance that a given result might occur. Risk is both: Systematic\u2014common to the business environment; or Unsystematic\u2014unique to the client\u2019s specific business itself (i.e., business risk), rather than to the market or the economy as a whole. Business risk impacts the profitability and success of the business as a whole. The good health of the business owner and key employees is essential to business survival. 1.2.3 Risk management \u00b6 The costs associated with the risk of business failure due to disability or illness can be managed by self-funding or insurance. 1.2.3.1 Self-funding \u00b6 Self-funding is a form of risk retention that refers to the business owner/partner personally paying for the costs that arise in his business due to his absence as a result of sickness or disability. The costs of business could include payroll, rent, inventory, etc. An individual has three options to self-fund the cost of a loss associated with a risk: Pay the cost out of current cash flow; Borrow to obtain funds to pay the cost; Use savings or sell assets. None of these options are ideal. Borrowing money is not always a viable option and can be expensive in the long term. The business owner should ideally have enough money saved to cover a period of time when he is not able to work. 1.2.3.2 Insurance \u00b6 A business owner\u2019s best option is to insure against the possible loss incurred by risks, such as death, disability or medical expenses caused by injury or illness. Insurance is based on the transfer of the financial impact of a risk, from a potential insured to the insurance company. A&S insurance transfers the risk of loss of income or medical expenses to the insurance company. A modest premium paid to the insurance company will assure that the necessary funds are in place to replace income lost or expenses incurred due to disability or illness. The insured person will lose their premium if they do not need to file a claim but the amount paid to the insurer will most typically be less than the amount that would be incurred if the insurance was not purchased. Life insurance pays a death benefit when the life insured dies. A&S insurance pays a benefit when there is an accident or illness. 1.2.4 Needs met by accident and sickness insurance for business \u00b6 Two principal factors are prevalent among successful businesses (particularly small/private businesses): Owners and/or key employees generating continuous revenue; Hiring and retaining quality and valuable employees. A key employee or business owner having an accident or falling ill could potentially be tragic for a business. A&S insurance policies benefit both business owners and employees. Business owners with A&S policies: Protect the revenue stream for the business and cover business expenses (rent, staff salaries, etc.) through business overhead expense (BOE) while the disabled owner/employee regains back his or her health; Attract and keep employees thanks to the appealing benefits offered by A&S insurance. Employees of a business with A&S policies: Know that they will continue to receive income to support themselves and their family if they are off work due to accident or illness; Know that their benefits will cover their medical expenses in the case of accident or illness. Example Ingrid is the sole owner and primary salesperson for a small import/export business that rents office space in an industrial mall and employs three staff. Last month, she was in an automobile accident and was injured severely enough that she was off work for 7 months. During the period of her disability, which promised to be temporary, the income of the business declined by 70% after the first couple of months. Without cash flow, the business would be forced to close its doors. However, Ingrid had the foresight to take out a BOE disability insurance policy on herself, which would pay out up to $15,000 a month to cover ongoing business expenses. The funds were sufficient to pay the rent and staff salaries and keep the business operating until such time as Ingrid was able to return to work.","title":"Chapter 1 Financial Protection Provided by Accident and Sickness Insurance"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_1_Financial_Protection_Provided_by_Accident_and_Sickness_Insurance/#chapter-1-financial-protection-provided-by-accident-and-sickness-insurance","text":"Accident and Sickness (A&S) insurance is defined as insurance that provides one or more of the following benefits to the life insured: Benefits for loss resulting from accidental bodily injury, including death, suffered by the life insured; Benefits for loss resulting from sickness or disability; Refund of expenses incurred due to sickness or accidental bodily injury suffered by the life insured; Refund of expenses incurred due to medical treatment of the life insured.

The increase in prices results in the decline in the purchasing value of money. Example Using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a guide, for example, a \u201cbasket\u201d of goods that cost $100 in 2000 cost $143.41 just 20 years later in 2020\u2014an increase of 43%\u2014during a period of historically low inflation.

An income that does not keep pace with inflation will have less purchasing power. In other words, salaries have to increase simultaneously with inflation for the worker to maintain his standard of living. Individuals on fixed incomes, such as retirees, face this problem because their salaries do not increase with inflation.

The life expectancy at birth for men has increased by 20.5 years, from 58.8 years in 1920-1922 to 79.3 years in 2009-2011. During the same period, the life expectancy of women increased by 23.0 years, from 60.6 years to 83.6 years. In 1920-1922, Canadian men who had lived to age 65 could expect to live for 13 more years, and women could expect to live for 13.5 more years (to age 78.0 and 78.5 respectively). In 2009-2011, 65-year-old men were expected to live until they were 83.8, while 65-year-old women were expected to live until the age of 86.7. This means that from 1920-1922 to 2009-2011, the life expectancies of 65-year-olds increased by 5.8 years for men and 8.2 years for women. Since the age of retirement has remained virtually unchanged at age 65 for many years, this means people spend more years of their lives in retirement than previously. There is a risk of outliving one\u2019s money if the amount of retirement income needed is underestimated. In other words, the money runs out before the life ends. Therefore, clients need to acquire more retirement assets to avoid outliving their money. This need is heightened because seniors often incur more health care costs due to health problems or potentially needing extra care at home or in an institution (i.e., a nursing home). For example, it is increasingly rare for seniors who need medical assistance to live with their families. They usually go to live in a retirement home, nursing home or chronic care facility (depending on their needs). These facilities can be extremely expensive. They can drain the seniors\u2019 savings and leave them in a position where they are dependent on the government or their children. These factors underscore the importance of clients saving for retirement while they are able to earn an income. These factors also demonstrate that retirees without enough savings to support their costs in retirement leave their children with little or no estate.","title":"1.1.2.6 Longevity"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_1_Financial_Protection_Provided_by_Accident_and_Sickness_Insurance/#1127-debt","text":"Debt reduces net worth.

Unexpected occurrences can cause a decrease in both short-term and long-term savings. Extended health insurance (another form of A&S insurance) is insurance to protect savings from expenses caused by sickness or disability. This greatly reduces the financial impact of many of these risks by providing the insured individual with cash for medical costs and to replace income. For example, travel insurance is a form of extended health insurance that pays the costs of sickness for a Canadian travelling in the U.S. Example Mrs. Johnson, who runs a consulting sole proprietorship business, was injured in a slip and fall accident in January and was unable to work for 8 months. As a result, she was unable to earn her regular $5,000 a month of consulting fees for those months, resulting in a nearly 50% reduction in family income.

Therefore, estate value is not eroded because assets remain in place to ultimately pass on to heirs and beneficiaries. Most Canadians save for their retirement, although the amount saved varies for each individual. The general intent is that the savings not spent during retirement are passed down to their heirs. However, health issues prevalent among seniors often drain retirement savings and estate assets, leaving a depleted legacy to pass onto heirs. Long-term care and critical illness insurance both protect this from happening by maintaining the value of the estate through providing benefits to offset much of these costs. Example Eudora, age 69, never earned a large salary and had no pension plan at her place of business. However, she did manage to accumulate about $250,000 in RRSPs and non-registered investments, in addition to her $150,000 home. To date, she has been able to manage on her $1,250 a month ( $15,000 a year) in government benefits and some interest and dividends from her investments. Eudora just discovered that she has a degenerative disease that will force her to move into a nursing home, at a cost of $2,750 a month ( $33,000 a year). Despite her health problems, Eudora has a normal life expectancy of age 85 (16 more years). The shortfall in her income versus the cost of the nursing home would require Eudora to liquidate $18,000 a year of her assets ( $33,000 \u2013 $15,000), reducing her estate by about $290,000 over her lifetime ( $18,000 \u00d7 16 years): money she had planned to leave to her three grandnieces. Fortunately, Eudora took out a long-term care policy when she was in her mid-50s. The policy will cover $1,000 of her monthly expenses ( $12,000 annually), reducing the erosion of her estate to less than $100,000 over her lifetime (( $18,000 \u2013 $12,000) \u00d7 16 years = $96,000), and enabling her to still leave a substantial legacy for her family.","title":"1.1.4.3 Protection for assets"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_1_Financial_Protection_Provided_by_Accident_and_Sickness_Insurance/#12-for-business-owners","text":"The needs and goals of business owners that require protection are, in many ways, similar to those of individuals and their families.

Many types of DI insurance coverage are available. Anyone who is insurable from a medical perspective and earns an income may acquire DI insurance coverage from the following sources: An individual disability income insurance policy obtained directly from the insurance provider; A group insurance coverage, as an employee or member of a union/association (that offers group insurance coverage); Creditor insurance provided by a lender to its borrowers; Provincial Workers\u2019 Compensation Boards; and Disability pensions through CPP and QPP. 2.1.1 Individual disability insurance \u00b6 An individual disability insurance contract is structured with: A policyholder, who is also called the insured, refers to the individual who pays the premium and collects the policy benefits; A life insured refers to the individual whose disability initiates the disability benefits; The life insured is often the same person as the policyholder; The life insured is the person who receives the benefit of the policy\u2014for instance, the monthly disability income benefit and may be called the policy beneficiary; The life insurance company provides the policy benefits. Therefore, individual DI contracts are entered into between the applicant (who is often both the policyholder and the life insured) and the insurance company. Generally, the policyholder is the premium payor, the life insured and the beneficiary under the policy. DI policies are purchased by: Individuals to replace income in the event of a disability; Business owners to replace financial loss incurred in the event of the disability of a key employee or employer. Insurance for business use is examined in Chapter 5. Premiums paid are not tax-deductible and benefits received are not taxable under individually owned DI policies. 2.1.2 Group disability insurance \u00b6 Plan members under one group policy receive group disability insurance. A group disability insurance contract is structured with: The policyholder\u2014the sponsor of the group; The life insured\u2014the group plan member; The life insurance company. The most common group disability insurance contract is an employer/employee group plan. In this case, the policyholder is the employer and the employees are both the life insured and the beneficiaries. The underwriting characteristics of the group as a whole determine the price of the group coverage. 2.1.3 Creditor insurance \u00b6 DI coverage is often offered by creditors (i.e., commercial lenders such as a bank) to borrowers (i.e., their clients). Creditor disability insurance ensures that borrowers can repay their loans if they become disabled. Creditor disability insurance pays: The scheduled monthly loan repayments of an insured traditional loan for the disabled borrower; The minimum monthly payments of a credit card outstanding for the disabled borrower. Creditor disability insurance: Is provided through a third party or an affiliated insurance company; Typically have a 90-day waiting period; Have a very strict definition of disability. 2.1.3.1 Mortgage disability insurance compared to individual disability insurance (traditional) \u00b6 The mortgage DI market is a specialized subsection of creditor insurance. An individual who has a mortgage can acquire disability insurance that will make monthly mortgage payments if he becomes disabled. Mortgage insurance can be provided through the financial institution that has provided the mortgage or through a personal policy. Insurance provided by the lending institution: Is issued as a group policy; Is the less expensive option; Has various restrictions and limitations\u2014underwriting is limited and less stringent; The borrower is the mortgagor and the financial institution is both the mortgagee and beneficiary. Insurance in the form of an individual income replacement policy: Is more flexible in how the policyholder can use benefits; Is the more expensive option\u2014premiums tend to be higher than mortgage insurance arranged through the lending institution; Provided after full underwriting; The life insured is the beneficiary of the DI policy; The borrower has the intent to use a portion of the claims to cover the monthly mortgage payments. Table 2.1 demonstrates that both approaches possess unique strengths and weaknesses. 2.2 Individual Disability Insurance (DI) \u00b6 There are various types of individual DI policies, each defined by the benefits it offers, the factors used to calculate premiums and the riders that may be added to it in order to customize the coverage offered. 2.2.1 Types of individual policies \u00b6 Many types of individual DI policies exist. Each policy is defined by its benefits, premiums and riders. Personally owned DI policies can be differentiated in the contract by the number of guarantees provided to the policyholder: An absolute guarantee (policy can never be altered/cancelled); An increasing premium; Contracts that can be terminated by the insurer at any time. The following most common types of DI policies are discussed in the following section: Non-cancellable policies; Guaranteed renewable policies; Cancellable policies; Guaranteed issue policies; Non-traditional disability insurance plans. 2.2.1.1 Non-cancellable policy \u00b6 Referred to as a non-cancellable (non-can) and guaranteed renewable contracts. A non-cancellable policy offers the most guarantees to its policyholder: The life insurance company cannot cancel the policy; Policy premiums cannot increase; Policy benefits cannot be reduced or changed; Carries the highest premium; The insurer renews the policy annually, until the life insured turns 65; The policyholder is the sole individual who can modify the policy, subject to underwriting if applicable, before its maturity. Typically, at age 65, the policyholder has an option to convert the policy, without proof of insurability, to a guaranteed renewable contract with a shortened benefit period generally ranging from a year or two. Premiums are based on the insured\u2019s age when the policy is converted. The guaranteed renewable policy typically ends when the life insured is 72 or 75. Because the benefit period is shortened to 12 or 24 months, the premiums remain reasonable even though the insured is over age 65. 2.2.1.2 Guaranteed renewable policy \u00b6 With guaranteed renewable policies the life insurance company is bound to renew the policy every year until the policy matures\u2014typically at age 65. But the insurer has a right to change the premiums unilaterally. The premium cannot be changed for an individual insured. Any change must apply to the entire class of policies that impact all lives insured under the class type. The policyholders have to be notified of any changes in the contract at least 30 days before a change or cancellation takes effect. All changes are put in place at the annual policy renewable time. 2.2.1.3 Cancellable policy \u00b6 A cancellable policy is also issued on a class basis meaning that all policy changes must apply to all of the policyholders\u2014the policy of a sole individual cannot be altered. It offers the fewest guarantees to the policyholder and carries the lowest premiums. The life insurance company can cancel the policy, reduce or change benefits, and increase premiums at any time without the policyholder\u2019s consent. The policyholders have to be notified of any changes in the contract at least 30 days before a change/modification takes effect. A cancellable policy is issued to higher-risk occupations (i.e., labourers, taxi drivers, etc.). Because of the lack of long-term certainty for the policyholder, all other factors being equal, premiums for cancellable contracts will be lower than those for guaranteed renewable policies, which, in turn, have lower premiums than non-cancellable and guaranteed renewable policies. Example Jean-Marc is insured under a non-cancellable guaranteed renewable disability insurance policy. Four years ago, Jean-Marc developed severe depression, for which he is still undergoing treatment. Recently, Jean-Marc asked his insurer to increase his coverage on his existing policy. The insurer refused to do so and proposed the additional coverage be covered by a cancellable policy. 2.2.1.4 Guaranteed issue policy \u00b6 The guaranteed issue policy is an individually issued policy only offered by a few insurers. It is an alternative to traditional long-term disability (LTD) group insurance. A guaranteed issue policy guarantees the coverage of the insured and is issued to individuals who are members of low-risk groups, such as lawyers, doctors, etc. The premium is higher than an equivalent group plan. The insurer can cancel the guaranteed aspect of the plan at any time by refusing to accept any further lives insured on a guaranteed basis. At the time of the application, applicants must be actively at work and not on a disability claim. Due to the plan\u2019s guaranteed nature, the guaranteed issue policies may incur certain restrictions based on the: Size of the group; Occupational category of the group members; Minimum annual premium commitment; Minimum average age for the group members. There are two forms of guaranteed issue plans. Guaranteed standard risk: Coverage is guaranteed to be issued without coverage restrictions or premium ratings; Often there will be extra restrictions based on the plan\u2019s administration such as every member of the group may be required to participate or that 100% of the premiums must be fully paid by the employer; The reason every member has to participate is to avoid anti-selection which refers to when an imbalance occurs in the risk levels presented by employees. A potential unbalance could occur if only higher-risk employees subscribed for the plan and lower-risk members opted out of the insurance. Guaranteed-to-issue: Coverage is based on medical underwriting. These plans guarantee to issue some form of coverage though not exactly the coverage applied for; Non-standard risks (that is people who pose a higher degree of risk than standard risk) may pay a higher premium, called a rated premium or issue an exclusion rider; If an individual poses a higher risk due to a particular hobby or activity, coverage may exclude a claim that arises from that hobby or activity. For example, if a person participates in scuba diving and becomes ill as a result of scuba diving, his claim may be denied. 2.2.1.5 Non-traditional disability insurance plans \u00b6 Insurance companies are responding to changes in the Canadian workforce by introducing new policies and easing up on restrictions. In the 21 st century, there has been a significant growth of self-employed workers in Canada. By 2019, 15.2% of Canadian workers were self-employed contract workers. These changes have had a significant impact on disability insurance and the main market of employees for which it has traditionally provided DI insurance. Insurance products must align themselves with the changing work market. Employers typically do not provide benefits for contract workers. Contract workers often seek out standard disability coverage but find that sickness coverage is not practical because it is too expensive/requires too long a waiting period to be beneficial. Contract workers prefer an affordable accident and sickness policy that would initiate immediately upon accident or illness (i.e., first-day benefits). Many insurers have made the accident and sickness elements of their DI policies distinct and separate. This policy insures against the loss of income due to either accident or sickness (but not both). Other insurers are changing the definition of disability to better suit the changing market: For example, changing the definition of total disability to the inability to perform specified functions instead of job duties. This new definition includes the work of the self-employed contract worker because workers who are not employees offer skills to a workplace instead of services and duties outlined in an employee contract; For example, offering an income-based definition of disability which bases disability on the inability to earn a specified percentage of regular income due to disability. This definition also acknowledges that job services often differ between contracts; For example, changing the definition of disability to the inability to find new contracts due to disability, thus offering disability benefits to unemployed self-employed contract workers. Some plans offer special benefits to an insured who may not have gainful employment such as an individual who provides full-time care to their children or who perform volunteer service. These policies provide the insured with limited monthly benefits to \u201ccontract out\u201d the services the insured was providing in the past such as babysitting, volunteering, etc. 2.2.2 individual Policy benefits \u00b6 Individual disability insurance is more involved than simply providing monthly income benefits to insured members who meet the policy\u2019s definition of disabled. Disability insurance (DI) policies differ in terms of benefits such as: The amount of benefits paid; When benefits commence; The duration that benefits are payable (if they are payable at all depending on the circumstances). 2.2.2.1 Amount of benefit \u00b6 One of the risks faced by disability insurers is that an insured will act differently due to the disability insurance being in place by claiming to be disabled or still disabled. In such cases, DI insurance potentially gives an individual the opportunity of earning an income without the need to actually work. Disability benefits from individually owned DI policies are tax-free; The maximum benefit of a DI policy is typically no more than 60% of pre-tax active income (that is income earned from performing actual work). It is not 100% of income because the disability benefit takes into account income tax and other benefits normally applicable to business income; This is easy to calculate when an individual solely earns a salary/self-employment income. Therefore, the formula for the disability benefit based on active income is: Pre-tax income \u00d7 percentage of DI coverage = disability benefit based on earned income Example 1 John earns $100,000 per year. His income of $100,000 is taxed at about 40%; his take-home pay is $60,000. His disability benefit would pay $60,000 and he would not pay tax on the $60,000. Example 2 Heinrich is a sole proprietor, working as a consulting computer technician. Most years, he earns $70,000 in consulting fees and has about $12,000 in business expenses which are only incurred if he is working. After allowing for income taxes annually, he gets to keep roughly $38,000 of the $70,000 that he earns. Based on his pre-tax income of $70,000, less $12,000 of deductible business expenses, an insurance company would offer him maximum DI coverage of about \\(34,800 ([\\) 70,000 - $12,000] \u00d7 60%). This is close to the $38,000 that he gets to keep, after-tax, while he is working. He is financially neither advantaged nor disadvantaged if he is on a disability claim, minimizing the chances that he would submit a false claim or artificially prolong a valid claim in order to continue receiving an income without working. It is more difficult to calculate the disability benefit if the insured has sources of passive income (income not earned by performing work) on top of his earned income that continues during a period of disability. Passive income can include earned or passive income of a spouse or family member, investment income, or cash flow that will continue if the insured is disabled. Insurers treat the continual, passive income as part of the disability benefit and reduce the disability coverage accordingly. If the insured were to receive the disability benefit in addition to their passive income, they will have little incentive to go back to work. The reduced disability benefit avoids such situations. In this case, the total income will be reduced by the passive income and the percentage of DI coverage (maximum of 60%) will be based on the final sum. Therefore, the formula to calculate the disability benefit, taking into account passive income that continues during a period of disability is: (Earned income + non-earned income) \u00d7 percentage of DI coverage \u2013 non earned income = disability benefit based on earned and non-earned income Example 2 (Cont.) Consider the case of Heinrich, above. Assume that, in addition to his earned income of $70,000 a year, he has income from a family trust of $20,000 a year, income that will be paid to him whether he is working or not. If the insurance company were to ignore the trust income and issue him $34,800 (or 60% of ( \\(70,000\u2015\\) 12,000)) of disability protection, during a period of disability, he would receive $34,800 a year from the insurance company and $20,000 from the trust\u2014or $54,800 a year of total income\u2014almost 78% of his gross, pre-disability earned income as a consulting computer technician. There would be little incentive for Heinrich to return to work. Even if the insurance company were to include the $20,000 of trust income in Heinrich\u2019s computation of \u201cearned income\u201d, he would end up being over-insured; 60% of Heinrich\u2019s total income of $70,000 ( $58,000 net in fees plus $20,000 from the trust) equals $46,800 a year in disability benefits. However, Heinrich would still be receiving the full $20,000 from the trust, making his total income $66,800 while on the disability claim. This would represent about 86% of Heinrich\u2019s pre-disability income, well in excess of the 60% threshold that would place him in a neutral position. Example 2 (Cont.) In this case, the insurer would be willing to insure a benefit equal to 60% of Heinrich\u2019s total pre-disability income of $78,000, or $46,800. However, the coverage offered would then be reduced by the $20,000 of trust income that he would still be receiving while disabled, leaving a DI benefit of $26,800. The combination of the disability benefit and the trust income would then total $46,800, or 60% of Heinrich\u2019s total pre-disability income of $78,000. 2.2.2.2 Waiting period \u00b6 The waiting period is the time between becoming disabled (onset of disability) and receiving a benefit. It is also called the elimination period. The waiting period can be as short as zero days, or as long as 12 months. 90 days is the norm. The longer the waiting period, the lower the premium. The least risky occupational classes receive the shortest waiting periods. All factors being equal, policies with a shorter waiting periods charge higher insurance premiums. Benefits are not paid during the waiting period. The waiting period is in place to avoid paying for disabilities of a very short-term nature. These short-term temporary disabilities are too expensive for the insurance company to pay in terms of administrative costs for the short duration of the disability. Example Alfred injured his leg in a fall while hiking on the weekend. He was unable to work for 8 months. His DI policy has a 90-day waiting period and a maximum 24-month benefit period. Because of the waiting period, the insurer paid out 5 months of benefits (8 months of disability less the 3-month waiting period) rather than the full 8 months. 2.2.2.3 Benefit period \u00b6 The benefit period is the maximum length of time benefits are paid by the policy. Benefits stop if the life insured is able to return to work or the benefit period has expired. Example 1 Simon has a policy with a 5-year benefit period. He returns to work three years after his disability occurs. His benefit stops when he returns to work. Example 2 Jen also has a policy with a 5-year benefit period. She is unable to return to work until six years after her disability occurs. Her benefit stops at the end of year 5. A person might be disabled more than once. Typically, each disability instance is treated on an individual basis\u2014the full benefit period could be applicable to each disability. For example, for a policy with a 5-year benefit, the insured could claim up to 5 years of the benefits for each disability. The most common benefit periods of long-term disability are 2, 5, 10-years, and to age 65. However, some insurers coverage up to age 75 on an accident-only basis. The most common benefit period of short-term disability insurance is 10\u201326 weeks (longer in some cases). The longer the maximum benefit period provided by the policy, the higher the premium. 2.2.2.4 Exclusions and limitations \u00b6 All policies have certain common exclusions. If the individual becomes disabled due to an activity listed as an exclusion (not covered by the policy) the individual will not receive the disability benefit. These exclusions are not related to the health, vocation or lifestyle of a specific insured, but apply to all persons insured under the type of policy. The most common exclusions include disabilities, caused by the following situations (for which disability benefits would not be payable) are: War; Terrorism; Self-inflicted injuries; Attempted suicide; Illegal activities; Normal pregnancy and birth. If the life insured presents a higher-than-standard risk that he will make a claim, the policy may be issued with a: Reduced monthly benefit; Increased waiting period; or Reduced benefit period. See also Section 2.2.4.8. 2.2.2.5 Denial of benefits \u00b6 Benefit will be denied and therefore not be paid when the following situations occur: Misstatement; Fraud; Absence of loss; Absence of proof; Delay in filing a claim. Misstatement of material fact on the insurance application: If an insured makes a false statement or a material misrepresentation, meaning he misrepresented or forgot a fact that would have affected the underwriting of the policy and this is discovered within two years of the policy issue date, the policy can be made void (i.e., declared legally invalid) by the insurance company. The two-year period is called the contestability period because after two years, the policy becomes incontestable. The contract is potentially voided based on the notion that if all the information and facts were initially accurately presented to the insurance company, the policy might never have been put in force in the first place. For example, failure to disclose a previous back injury that could have impacted the underwriting decision is a misstatement. Fraud: Fraud is when the insured attempts to, or is successful at, deceiving the insurance company in order to receive a policy or pay a lower premium. If the misrepresentation was made by mistake (i.e., the applicant forgot about a health factor and honestly assumed it was not important to disclose), then no fraud is presumed to have taken place. Fraud always voids a policy regardless of when it is discovered. A false claim refers to when an insured commits fraud at the time of a claim. If the insured makes a false claim, the insurer holds the right to call the entire policy and deny the claim. Absence of loss: Benefits are only payable under a disability claim if the claim is both proven to be valid and there is evidence of income loss due to disability. The life insured must show income to substantiate his claim. If his income when he makes a claim was lower than the amount he was insured for, the claim will be adjusted to reflect the actual (lower) income;=. For example, if the individual is unemployed or has a reduced income when making the disability claim, his benefits will be potentially reduced or denied altogether. Example Haroon took out a disability income replacement policy in 2009 when he was earning $60,000 a year, which, if disabled, would pay him a $3,000 monthly benefit equal to 60% of his income ((12 \u00d7 $3,000) \u00f7 $60,000). By 2014, Haroon had lost his former job and was now working for a different employer at a reduced salary of $48,000 a year. If Haroon was to become disabled now, his maximum monthly benefit would be only $2,400 a month equivalent to 60% of his current salary ( $48,000 \u00d7 60% \u00f7 12). Absence of proof: Medical proof of disability must accompany a claim that he is, in fact, disabled and unable to work (an individual cannot just say he is disabled and receive a disability benefit). A prolonged period of disability will require ongoing proof. The insurer will at the very least request a medical report from the insured\u2019s doctor. The insurer might additionally request a medical exam and/or other tests from a physician chosen by the insurer. Delay in filing a claim: A claim must be filed no later than 90 days after the disability occurs, or by the deadline specified by the insurance company in the policy. Insurers have the right to deny benefits if a claim is not made in time. In an ideal situation, the insured should contact the insurer right away following the beginning of the disabling condition. 2.2.2.6 Rehabilitation benefit \u00b6 It is best for all parties involved if the disabled insured returns back to work as soon as the insured can safely and practically work again: The insured will begin earning his full salary again; The employer will regain the insured\u2019s skills and services; The insurance company will no longer have to pay the claim. Rehabilitation is not mandatory under DI policies but it is highly encouraged by the insurance company and is thus often reimbursed fully or partially by the insurer. The policy will outline the amount of rehabilitation services that are covered under the insurance policy as well as a potential maximum dollar limit available for rehabilitation services. If the life insured plans to use one or more rehabilitation services, he must submit his plan to the company for pre-approval of the cost(s). Rehabilitative services provided for rehabilitation are the following (but are not limited to): Physiotherapy; Occupational training; Medical treatment; Job placement; Psychotherapy. 2.2.2.7 Benefits for recurring disability \u00b6 Recurring disability occurs when a life insured returns to work after an absence due to disability only to have the disability, attributed to the same cause, reoccur. The life insured then stops working due to his disability and goes back on disability leave. In this case, the disabled worker could potentially be subject to two lengthy waiting periods without any payable benefits in a short period of time\u2014a waiting period for the first disability instance and another waiting period when the disability reoccurs. Example Ophelia injured her back in January of 2014, in a fall on ice in the parking lot of the office where she works. She was off work for five months, collecting disability benefits for two of those months after allowing for the 90-day waiting period under her DI coverage. Two months after returning to work she was forced to take time off again, another four months in this instance, as sitting at her computer chair all day long aggravated her previous back injury. If she was required to undergo another 90-day waiting period for the second instance of disability, she would have received only three months of benefits during a period when she was disabled for nine months out of eleven. The recurrent disability clause in many DI contracts is designed to prevent the insured from having to undergo another waiting period when a disability reoccurs. For most policies, if the second instance of disability, resulting from the same clause, occurs within six months after returning to work, the situation is treated as one instance of disability and the second waiting period will not apply. The disability must be a recurrence of the original health condition; it cannot be a new condition. Example (Cont.) In Ophelia\u2019s case, above, if her policy contained a recurring disability clause, she would not be subject to a second waiting period and her benefits would recommence immediately upon the onset of the second instance of disability, incurred after only two months back on the job. As such, she would receive six months\u2019 worth of benefits during the eleven-month period, not merely three. The disadvantage to a recurring disability clause is that the two or more periods of recurring disability can be treated as one benefit period without any interruption. Therefore, the disability benefit is calculated from the beginning of the first benefit period. If the benefit period is shorter (i.e., two to five years), this could greatly affect the total amount of benefits received due to a disability that lasts for an extended period of time. This also means that benefits could potentially run out before the end of the second disability period. Example Ryan hurts his back in a skiing accident. His disability policy has: A 24-month benefit period; A 90-day waiting period. Ryan is approved for his disability claim and after 90 days receives his first benefit. Six months later Ryan returns to work, and after two months finds he is unable to work due to back pain from the accident. He begins to receive his policy benefit again. It begins immediately; there is no waiting period. He has 18 months remaining in benefits (i.e., the 24-month policy benefit minus 6 months\u2019 benefit received), not 24, because of the benefits received under the first claim were deducted from his remaining benefit period. 2.2.2.8 Benefits for presumptive disability \u00b6 A presumptive disability refers to when the insured suffers from a specified type of disability or the injury is so severe that the individual is presumed to be disabled. In such cases, the waiting period is waived and benefits are paid for the full benefit period, even if the life insured is able to resume work at his previous income level. Presumptive disabilities include: Total and Irreversible loss of hearing; Total and Irreversible loss of sight; Loss of limbs, or loss of the use of limbs, including both arms, both legs, and an arm and leg; and Total and permanent loss of speech. The benefits start immediately even if the insured can return to work and fulfill all of his previous duties as well as receive his full salary right away. Therefore, loss of income does not have to be proven to receive the disability benefit (as is the case with most disability benefits). In order to receive the disability benefit the insured must prove that the qualifying disability exists. The presumptive disability benefit is available in the majority of (but not necessarily all) policies. 2.2.2.9 Survivor benefit \u00b6 Some disability policies include a survivor benefit clause that if the life insured dies while receiving a disability benefit, a lump-sum survivor benefit may be paid to his estate. A qualification period is sometimes required by the policy, such that the survivor benefit is only payable if the insured had been disabled for a minimum period prior to his death (for example, 12 months). Upon proof of death, the sum is paid in a lump sum and is usually three times the monthly benefit. Example ABC insurance pays David $3,000 a month for his disability benefit while he is unable to work due to injury. David suddenly dies in the middle of his disability claim. ABC insurance pays three times the total monthly disability benefit to his estate. Therefore, David\u2019s estate receives $9,000 ( $3,000 x 3). 2.2.3 Individual Policy premium factors \u00b6 Aside from the monthly benefit requested, a variety of factors impact the premium charged for a disability income replacement policy such as the following: The insured\u2019s age; The insured\u2019s gender; The insured\u2019s health; Smoker/non-smoker status; Occupation; Definition of disability used; Claims history of the insured; The length of waiting and benefit periods for the policy. Each of these factors will be discussed in the subsequent section. Other factors not listed and not specific to the insured that also affect the premium rate are: An estimate of investment returns on accumulated premiums and expenses related to operating; Morbidity tables in terms of assessing and evaluating the likely cost of taking on risk. Morbidity refers to the actuarial estimate of the risk of disability within segments of the population, broken down by age, gender, occupation, etc. These other factors will be examined later on in the study notes. 2.2.3.1 Impact of gender and age \u00b6 The life insured\u2019s age and gender are two of the most significant factors in setting policy premiums in a DI policy. In terms of gender, women experience a higher number of claims and length of disability than men. In terms of age, younger people have a higher risk of disability than those who are older. But the length of time they are disabled is shorter than for older people. Therefore: It is likely that men will pay lower DI premium than women of the same age group for the same coverage; Younger applicants will likely pay lower DI premium than older applicants. Table 2.2 demonstrates the risk of becoming completely disabled before age 65 for more than 90 days and the average duration of the disability. It may be noted from above that the probability of disability is greater among those who are 25 years old than for those who have already reached 45, though the average duration of disability is longer for those who have reached 45 years of age. Insurance carriers create similar morbidity tables based on their claims history with their target markets. 2.2.3.2 Health issues \u00b6 The overall health of the life insured, in the past, present and future has a direct bearing on premiums and the underwriting process. Family issues will also be a concern when there is a genetic link to the life insured. For example, when health conditions are likely to run in the family such as having more than one family member with breast cancer. Premiums and benefits are classified as: Standard Life - reflecting the same degree of risk as the average individual; Rated - reflecting a higher degree of risk than the average individual; Uninsurable - reflecting an unacceptable degree of risk. If an applicant has health issues, an exclusion of coverage for specified causes of disability may be offered. The applicant will receive the same standard premium and benefits if he lives an average life and thus likely faces the same risks of disability as the average individual. The applicant will be denied insurance or will be subject to higher premiums, which do not include coverage for particular causes of disability, if the applicant has a history of health complications (or is still injured/ill). If an applicant files a disability claim within one year of the application, the condition that led to that claim may be classified as a \u201cpre-existing condition.\u201d Insurers often state in DI policies that, under a one-year exclusion rider, any pre-existing conditions may be excluded from the coverage for the year following the issue of the policy. Many sources of information are used to compile the medical \u201cpicture\u201d of the applicant, including a(n): Attending physician\u2019s statements (APS) from the applicant\u2019s doctor; Non-medical form on the application; Paramedical exam from a nurse, if required; Full doctor\u2019s medical exam, if required; Blood, saliva and urine samples; Data from the Medical Information Bureau (MIB); Inspection report from an investigator for lifestyle issues. 2.2.3.3 Definitions of disability \u00b6 The definition of when an insured is \u201cdisabled\u201d for puposes of disability insurance is not just a single one. A disability may be \u201cpartial\u201d or \u201ctotal\u201d and, within that range, four distinct definitions are used in different policies. Different definitions of disability are used by different policies. Typically, the disability\u2019s cause is not considered in the definition. Workers\u2019 Compensation coverage which deals solely with work-related injuries and illnesses is the exception and takes into account the disability\u2019s cause. The four main definitions of disability used in DI are: Own occupation; Regular occupation; Any occupation; and Total disability (according to the CPP). Partial disability will be defined and examined later in this chapter. Own Occupation The own occupation definition of disability is the most liberal in that it is the easiest under which to qualify as being disabled\u2014the insured is seen as completely disabled if he cannot carry out his main work tasks, even part time. The insured never has to return to work post-disability if he cannot perform the primary duties of his regular occupation\u2014he returns to work once he can perform all the main duties of his regular occupation. Furthermore, he can take another job in another occupation and continue to receive his disability benefit. This type of policy is only available to the highest classification of occupants \u2013 those who are least likely to make a claim, such as doctors, lawyers, dentists, etc. \u201cOwn occupation\u201d carries the highest premium due to: The generous benefits provided to the life insured; and the larger policy purchased by high-income professionals who qualify for a cheaper rate/$100. These individuals are the least likely to need to file claims and tend not to stay on claim as long as other occupation classes, who earn less and, therefore, have to purchase smaller policy coverage. Example Tobias worked as a surgeon, earning $240,000 a year. Four years ago, he was injured in his home workshop and lost all the dexterity in his right hand. As a consequence, he can no longer function as a surgeon. After rehabilitation, Tobias took up a position at the local medical school, teaching other surgeons the techniques that he had developed. He also travels on the lecture circuit and has published two books since his accident. In total, he now earns $300,000 a year from his various enterprises but, since he can no longer function as a surgeon, he continues to receive benefits under his DI policy, which has an \u201cown occupation\u201d definition of disability. Regular Occupation The regular occupation definition uses the same definition and has the same implications as own occupation except if the life insured takes another job, the disability benefit may be reduced or ended. The decision about returning to work is made only by the life insured\u2014even if he is physically able. Also available to those who are least likely to make a claim. Has a lower premium than own occupation. Any Occupation The any occupation definition of disability is applicable when the insured is seen as disabled if he is ill/injured and thus cannot carry out some or all of the functions associated with his regular occupation and he is not able to carry out the functions of any other occupation that would be suitable for him based on his education or experience. This is the most stringent definition of disability since there are so many potential occupations for which the insured might still be capable of performing (and the insured\u2019s ability to perform the duties of any suitable occupation disqualifies him from being classified as \u201cdisabled\u201d). This type of policy is available to the greatest number of individuals, including those in higher-risk occupational classes. It is expected that the life insured who cannot work in his regular occupation will become employed in another job as a suitable alternative to his regular occupation or benefits may cease. This type of DI policy has the lowest DI premium. Total Disability according to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Total disability is the definition used by the Canada Pension Plan. The definition applies when the insured is totally unable to work at any job that he is suited for by his education and experience. It entails that the insured will likely never recover and be able to return to employment (i.e., severe and prolonged) and may likely die from the cause of the medical condition. This definition is rarely used by conventional group or individual DI policies. However, it is used more often in creditor insurance coverage. Exception \u2013 In Qu\u00e9bec, the Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP) defines total disability in slightly different terms: the disability must be seen as serious (inability to hold any employment on a full-time basis) as well as permanent (last indefinitely, without any chance of getting better). 2.2.3.4 Occupational clause \u00b6 Some occupations are riskier than others and those who work in them are more likely to make claims. In underwriting disability insurance, the applicant\u2019s occupation is taken into consideration in terms of: The applicant\u2019s insurability; The policy type available; The riders and benefits available; The cost (premium level) for the coverage. Higher-risk occupations may not be offered policy types or benefits offered to those in lower-risk occupations. Life insurance companies categorize occupations by the risk of claims being made. These are called occupational classes. The following are the most common forms of classification: 4A \u2013 Professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, dentists and senior executives; 3A \u2013 Administrative office workers who face few, if any, workplace hazards, such as clerical staff; 2A \u2013 Supervisors in low-risk environments, salespersons and like occupations; A \u2013 Skilled manual workers who face few or no workplace hazards, or those working, for instance, as courier truck drivers; B \u2013 Manual labourers who work in hazardous environments, such as home construction workers. A lower premium would be available to the 4A occupation than the 3A occupation for the same coverage, lower premium for 3A vs. 2A, etc. Certain policy types/benefits would not be available to those in higher-risk classifications. For example, an applicant in the A class would not be able to likely get an own occupation coverage. Most DI contracts have an occupational clause that if a life insured changes to a riskier occupation, he may find his premiums increase or his benefits are reduced. The reverse is also true: if a new job has less risk than the old, the life insured can ask for a higher classification. At the underwriting stage, those in higher-risk categories may qualify for better consideration if they meet requirements for job and income stability. Even though the insured continues in a higher-risk occupation, an upgrade would equate to a lower premium. A medical underwriting would be necessary to confirm that the insured has not developed into a higher risk for reasons other than his occupation. Example Eunice took out a disability income replacement policy when she worked as an administrator in the office of a printing factory, a 3A classification. She paid $225 a month. Five years later, Eunice changed jobs with the same employer and is now working as a staff supervisor on the floor of the printing plant, an A classification job. Her policy was guaranteed renewable, so she was able to keep her coverage but her premium increased to $350 a month and her waiting period was extended from 60 to 90 days. 2.2.3.5 Waiver of premium \u00b6 A waiver of premium refers to an intrinsic provision of the DI contract in which premium payment is waived (i.e., no premiums need to be paid by the insured) during the time the life insured under the policy is on a disability claim. Note that the waiver of premium is not a rider (as it is with life insurance policies). The premium for a disability income policy is waived (that is, not applied): When the life insured is receiving the disability benefit or; To the end of the benefit period/to when the life insured reaches 65 years (whichever comes first). The terms of the contract determine if the waiver of premium applies to the disability. Some policies only apply a waiver of premium involving total disability and sometimes partial disability. How does it work? Generally, the policyholder continues to pay the premium for the disability income policy for 90 days after he is totally disabled. After this period, the waiver commences. Many policies will refund the premium paid during the 90-day waiting period. The policyholder then makes no further premium payments for the duration of the claim or the period specified in the policy. 2.2.4 Riders to address needs \u00b6 Disability insurance includes standard provisions intrinsic to essentially all DI policies. These benefits and restrictions are often specialized to meet the circumstances of the insured. These special situations are met by the insurance industry by putting in place riders to policies. Riders refer to special provisions that are unique to that policy; they are put in place to meet the needs of the applicant. 2.2.4.1 Concept of customization \u00b6 Customizing refers to adjusting a standard DI policy\u2019s terms and conditions by adding riders to the contract. As stated, a rider customizes a policy to meet the needs of the applicant by adding, removing or restricting benefits according to the insurance company in order to minimize its exposure to risk. Some of the most common riders are discussed in the subsequent section. 2.2.4.2 Differences between \u201cequivalent\u201d riders \u00b6 Strict standards are not established for the definitions that apply to riders. Riders offered by different insurers need to be carefully compared and scrutinized in precise detail by the agent to be certain that they are equivalent. The agent should not assume that a specific rider will offer standard benefits within each contract even if there are standard definitions within the industry. 2.2.4.3 Future purchase option (FPO) \u00b6 The future purchase option (FPO) is also referred to as the guaranteed insurability benefit (GIB) or the guaranteed insurability option (GIO). FPO gives the insured the right to increase the benefit at future times or on the policy anniversary without proof of insurability. However, the benefit payment can never exceed 60% of pre-disability earned income. Thus, if the coverage currently in force is 60% of pre-disability income, no further coverage can be purchased, even though the right to purchase coverage without medical evidence is guaranteed. In the past, around every two years, the insured was given the option to increase his coverage. Now, the policies issued offer the options to increase on the anniversary of the policy. Any new coverage attained under the FPO is issued based on the life insured\u2019s attained age at the time the option is exercised. Depending on the contract, options are usually available up to the life insured\u2019s age of 50 or 55. The way in which attained age is calculated depends on the contract terms (i.e., on age on last birthday, age on next birthday or age nearest a birthday). There is a maximum amount of coverage that can be purchased per option and overall: Each option is often limited to 20% of base coverage to a maximum of $1,500 a month of new coverage; The overall limit is in the range of two to five times the initial amount of coverage under the base policy. If the insured has remained in the same occupation, new coverage obtained through the FPO is based on the same occupational class as the original policy. The contract may allow the FPO to go into effect right away or the exercise may be put off until the current claim\u2019s termination if the life insured is on disability claim when the option arises. The main limit in using the FPO is that the insured must qualify for the extra coverage from a financial perspective. The insured must provide the insurer with a proof of their current income. Exercising the FPO increases coverage which in turn increases the premium. In terms of an FPO, no further coverage can be bought if the coverage currently in force is equal to 60% of earned income (despite the fact that the right to buy coverage without medical evidence is guaranteed). Two rules are applicable: The current option may not be exercised if the current income of the insured has stayed the same since policy issue or exercise of the last option, and the coverage currently in force equates to 60% of current income. If the 60% of the current income of the insured is greater than the current coverage in force, the option may be exercised to a maximum of the current option or an amount that would bring the coverage up to 60% of current income, whichever is less. Example Fritz was earning $60,000 a year, net as a freelance handyman two years ago when he applied for disability insurance. He qualified medically and financially and was issued a DI policy with coverage of $3,000 a month ((60% \u00d7 $60,000) \u00f7 12). His policy has an FPO rider which permits him to increase coverage, guaranteed, by 20% of his original coverage (or $600 a month), this year if he can qualify financially. His income has increased by $6,000, to $66,000 a year. At his new income level, Fritz could qualify financially for $3,300 a month of disability coverage ((60% \u00d7 $66,000) \u00f7 12). Since he already holds $3,000 a month of coverage, he could only exercise the FPO to acquire an additional $300 a month of coverage, despite the fact that the option allows for up to $600 a month of coverage without medical underwriting. 2.2.4.4 Cost of living adjustment (COLA) \u00b6 Inflation increases the cost of living. Those who depend on long-term disability benefits as income will find that, over time, their purchasing power is reduced due to inflation and the fixed nature of the disability benefit. This is a problem that insured\u2019s face who depend on LTD benefits as their primary source of income. The cost of living adjustment (COLA) rider increases the monthly benefit being paid under a disability income replacement contract annually, beginning in the second year benefits are paid. The increase is either: Simple: The benefit is indexed by a set percentage increase (e.g., 2.00% or 4.00%) of the initial benefit payable; Compound: Following the claim\u2019s first year, on a compound basis, the benefit is indexed to the rate of inflation and is thus increased by the CPI every year. In other words, the monthly benefit is increased based on the inflation rate for the previous calendar opposed to the initial benefit. Example Jennifer is entitled to $3,000 a month in benefits under a DI policy indexed to the CPI and under which the COLA is compounded. The following table demonstrates how her monthly benefit will increase every year due to the compounded COLA. Some policies limit a maximum annual indexing rate (i.e., 5%). Many policies may also carry forward an unused allotment to future years: For example, if the indexing rate for year 4 of a claim is 1.5% lower than the maximum allowed under the contract, that 1.5% can be carried forward to years in the future, to create more indexing room for years when the inflation rate exceeds the maximum annual indexing permitted under the contract. Furthermore, policies put in place a predetermined limit for the maximum amount of indexing so that the annual benefit paid out under an indexed policy does not surpass two or three times the initial, un-indexed, annual benefit. An automatic coverage enhancement, also called an automatic benefit increase, is an alternative (not an addition) to the COLA rider offered by some DI policies. Every year the benefit automatically increases, without a medical or financial underwriting, by a small fixed percentage (i.e., 2 or 3%) and the premium increases in step with the enhanced benefit. The enhancement may be reviewed and underwritten on a periodic basis (i.e., every 5 years). The benefit provides an indexed policy with increasing premiums that applies the increase in coverage after the policy is issued and does not wait for a claim to be made. It basically attempts to keep up with annual raises that most employees receive. 2.2.4.5 Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) \u00b6 The accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) rider provides the insured with supplementary benefits not included in the regular benefits payable on account of income loss due to disability. If the insured dies or suffers from specific severe injuries due to an accident, the AD&D rider benefits are paid. For the claim to be paid: The death/injury of the insured must happen within 365 days of the accident; The death/injury must be directly related to the accident. In the case of death, within 365 days of an accident, the AD&D rider is generally paid in a lump sum, referred to as the principal sum. In the case of injury, the AD&D rider is generally paid a percentage of the lump sum according to the severity of the loss (i.e., the loss of sight, hearing, limbs, etc.). Medical underwriting is not necessary when the rider is issued due to the fact that benefits are only payable when an accidental loss occurs. There are specified exclusions for payment of the AD&D benefit, such as: Self-inflicted wounds; Attempted suicide; Participation in dangerous sports; Flying other than a passenger on a commercial airliner. 2.2.4.6 Partial and residual disability benefits \u00b6 Partial disability benefits are intended to encourage re-entry to the workplace. This is due to the fact that if the insured would receive full benefits in the event of total disability but no benefits if he were to return into the workforce part-time\u2014it would be hard to encourage a disabled worker to return to work part-time. - Residual disability benefits Residual disability benefits encourage disabled workers to return to the workplace as soon as they are physically able. A residual disability benefit is a type of partial benefit offered by many DI policies. This means that if the insured is able to work part-time following a total disability period, the disabled will receive a portion of his benefits. The life insured must first experience total disability (a complete inability to work) for a specified minimum amount of time including the waiting period (typically 6 months including the waiting period) to qualify for a residual disability benefit. When total disability has ceased, the benefit is paid if the disabled can return to work and perform some substantial duties or can perform all substantial duties some of the time. Therefore, once the insured returns back to work, he will be receiving two forms of income\u2014both, part of the disability benefit and the employment income. In order for an insured to qualify for residual benefits, there are specific requirements regarding both the insured\u2019s minimum and maximum income: Pre-disability income must be reduced by 20% or more to receive the benefit; In other words, if the life insured earns 80% or more of his pre-disability income, he will not receive the residual benefit; Therefore, if he earns between 20% and 80% of what he earned working, he receives a benefit in proportion to the percentage of income not received; The life insured will receive the full benefit if he earns 20% or less of his pre-disability income. There are three steps to determine the total income received by taking the residual benefit: Determine the percentage of income that is lost which is calculated as: Apply the percentage of income that is lost against the full disability benefit received which is calculated as: Full benefit x % of income lost = residual benefit Add the residual benefit to income earned = income received which is calculated as: Residual benefit + income earned = income received Example Carol\u2019s pre-disability active income is $100,000. Carol has been receiving a total disability benefit of 60% or $60,000 per year ( $5,000 per month). If she returns to work and makes $80,000 or more, she will not receive any disability benefit. If she returns to work and makes less than $20,000, she will receive a full disability benefit. - Carol\u2019s pre-disability active income is $100,000. Carol has been receiving a total disability benefit of 60% or $60,000 per year ( $5,000 per month). If she returns to work and makes $80,000 or more, she will not receive any disability benefit. If she returns to work and makes less than $20,000, she will receive a full disability benefit. She returns to work part time and earns $2,000 per month or $24,000 per year. How much will she receive from her disability benefit and income? Example (Cont.) Step 1: What percentage of income has she lost? The percentage of income that she has lost by returning to work is: She has lost 76% of her pre-disability income. Step 2: How much will she receive as a residual benefit? Apply the percentage of income she has lost against the full disability benefit received: Full benefit x % of income lost = $5,000 \u00d7 76% = $3,800 She will receive $3,800 per month as a residual disability benefit. Step 3: What is her total income as a result of returning to work? Add the residual benefit to income earned: - Residual benefit + income earned = $3,800 + $2,000 = $5,800 Carol\u2019s total monthly income will be $5,800. Therefore, she receives more income as a result of working part-time than on the disability benefit alone. - Partial disability benefits - Partial disability benefits are paid by insurance contracts from the beginning of disability. - This does not require a proof of total disability. When due to disability, the insured cannot perform some of his job\u2019s principal duties (or can only perform them for part of the time), the policy provides the insured with 50% of his total disability benefit for a specific period of two to three years. The benefits come from the partial disability benefit or the residual disability benefit\u2014whichever is greater. The DI contracts generally ask that: The insured be under the care of a physician; The insured undergoes an initial qualification period of total disability before the partial disability benefits will be paid to the insured; Partial disability benefits vary between insurance companies\u2014the agent must ensure that the policy details are clear to an applicant. 2.2.4.7 Return of premium (ROP) \u00b6 A policyholder may pay thousands of dollars of premiums over the course of their DI policy and never receive any of the money because they never needed to file a valid claim. The return of premium (ROP) rider addresses this concern and provides a tax-free refund of premiums paid if, when the policy expires, total claims paid are less than total premiums paid. For example: If by age 65, no valid claims have been paid, the insured will receive 70% of all premiums paid; If the total claims paid during the policy\u2019s lifetime are less than the total amount of premiums paid, the difference would be paid back to the insured upon the maturity date of the coverage; If the claims paid out to the insured surpass the amount of premiums paid, then no return of premiums is payable. Some policies state that the rider may also apply if a policy is cancelled before its expiration date and no claims have been paid out on the policy. In this case, a partial ROP is often paid. Some policies also state that if the contract lasts for a specific duration (generally 8 or 10 years) without paying a claim, anywhere from 4 times the annual premium to at least 70 \u2013 80% of the premiums paid during that period OR a percentage of the annual premium will be paid back to the insured. This rider is expensive and may increase the base DI premium by 40\u201360%. 2.2.4.8 Ratings and exclusion riders \u00b6 When the risk that the life insured may make a claim appears more likely than what is considered standard, his application may be: Declined\u2014not issuing the policy; Charged a higher premium, called a premium rating; An exclusion rider may be added to the policy; Declining the policy is seen as a last option. A premium rating is an increased premium which assumes substandard risks and compensates the insurance company for the additional risk it assumes. The premium rating does assume more risks than what is considered standard but, on the other hand, it does not assume risks that are too high either. For example, an insured with an overall health issue such as diabetes will have to pay a premium rating to compensate the insurance company for the risk it assumes taking on a client with a health condition. The insured may have the option to have a medical assessment in order to have the option re-underwritten as well as the rating lowered or taken off altogether if the condition improves in the future. An exclusion rider will exclude a claim arising from a substandard risk such as a particular lifestyle, activity or condition that has a greater risk of causing a disability. For example, a scuba diver has a greater risk of becoming disabled than someone who does not scuba dive. Therefore, scuba diving would most likely be excluded from the rider. In these cases, the insurance company will issue the policy but with an exclusion rider, excluding the particular risky activity from the policy so that if a disability does arise from the identified activity it will not be paid. Typically, the contract would then be issued with a standard premium in order for other standard episodes of disability to be covered by the rider. Example Eldridge applied for disability income replacement insurance despite the fact that he had a damaged disk in his back, the consequence of his sporting activities. The life insurance company was willing to issue the policy, at standard premium rates, but with an exclusion rider that stipulated that no benefits would be payable due to a disability related to Eldridge\u2019s back problems. 2.2.4.9 Hospitalization benefit \u00b6 Basic disability income protection insurance solely replaces earned income\u2014it does not cover additional costs incurred due to disability. Hospital costs are a common expense not covered by the standard DI policy. In this case, either a hospitalization benefit rider or a hospital indemnity rider can be added to a DI policy to cover those expenses. There are two hospital-stay related benefits available as riders: The first-day hospitalization benefit: Provides a benefit between the time when the life insured is admitted to hospital and the first day the disability benefits begin (typically 90 days later); The insured must usually stay in the hospital for 18\u201372 hours for the benefits to be payable; Its payment is made on a daily basis, as a percentage of the monthly benefit. The hospital indemnity rider: Covers expenses that arise from hospitalization of the life insured, such as parking, child care and transportation. Provided as a daily sum, usually between $50 and $250. Begins on day one of hospitalization: the life insured must stay in the hospital at least 24 hours. Coverage is provided for a maximum of three to four months. 2.2.5 Taxation of individual disability insurance (DI) benefits \u00b6 Whether the benefits are received as taxable or tax-free income impacts the amount of disability insurance for which an applicant can qualify. Tax-free benefits represent a greater proportion of the insured\u2019s pre-disability net income. Furthermore, the applicant\u2019s ability to afford the coverage is partially dependent on whether or not premiums paid for disability insurance can be deducted for income tax purposes. 2.2.5.1 Tax treatment of premiums and benefits \u00b6 Premiums paid for individual disability income replacement policies are not tax deductible and benefits are received tax-free. Such is the case for the following benefits: Disability income benefits; Treatments received by the life insured and paid for by the life insurance company; for example, physiotherapy; Waiver of premium; Return of premium refunds (ROP) benefits. For businesses: A DI policy taken out on the life of an employee where the employer pays the premium and is a beneficiary of the contract\u2014the policy premiums are not a tax-deductible business expense. Business overhead expense (BOE) is an exception to this rule. Different tax rules apply to individual DI policies taken out by an employer on a class of employees; If an unincorporated employer takes out a DI policy on an employee\u2019s life and the benefits are payable to the employee, the premiums are likely tax-deductible by the employer. Premiums paid by the employer or benefits received by the employee would be treated as taxable income for the employee\u2014one or the other, not both. Further taxation of business insurance is covered in Chapter 5. 2.2.5.2 Taxation differences between personally owned and corporately owned disability insurance (DI) policies \u00b6 There is little difference in the taxation of personally-owned and corporately-owned disability insurance policies. Corporately-owned DI policies purchased in order to compensate the corporation in the event of the long-term disability of a key employee, or to buy out a permanently disabled shareholder\u2019s interests, are treated the same as a personally-owned DI policy. The premiums paid are not tax-deductible and benefits received by a corporation are not a taxable inclusion. If a corporate DI policy insures an employee\u2019s life (who is also the beneficiary of any policy benefits), the premiums will be a: Deductible business expense for the employer; and a taxable item to the employee for the year in which they were paid. If a corporate DI policy insures a shareholder of the company (or both an employee and a shareholder), the premiums will be: Likely administered as a shareholder benefit by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA); Non-deductible by the employer and; Taxable in the hands of the shareholder. 2.2.6 Conversion of policy \u00b6 Conversion refers to a provision in most life insurance policies which states that the life insured may, with the same insurer, transfer a term insurance policy into a permanent policy without having to prove medical insurability. Non-term individual disability income insurance policies do not follow the same concept of conversion. A conversion clause will be included in BOE and buy-sell insurance policies. Certain types of business disability insurance policies may permit the life insured to transfer the policy and its benefits to a personal policy (i.e., when the policy is no longer needed for business use). This converts the policy from a corporate policy to a personal policy. There is no medical underwriting when the conversion occurs; it happens when a claim is made. Also, DI policies that are non-cancellable often provide the policyholder with the choice to convert the policy at age 65 to a guaranteed renewable policy, with a restricted duration and benefit period. 2.3 Group Disability Insurance \u00b6 Group DI insurance is provided to many individuals under one principal policy. A group disability policy establishes an employer as the policyholder and its employees as the lives insured and beneficiaries. Group coverage is often the only DI policy an insured has in his portfolio due to: Cost-efficient coverage; The insured does not have to do much administration at all. The insurance company informs the group members of the insurance benefits. 2.3.1 Providers of group disability insurance \u00b6 Group DI coverage is most often provided to group members without proof of medical writing. Therefore, issuing the life insurance to a particular group provides the insurer with an element of shared characteristics among the group members (i.e., they all have, more or less, the same amount of risk). Examples of groups that possess common characteristics are: They work for the same employer; They work in the same industry; They are members of the same association; They are alumni of the same university or college; They belong to the same union. The common characteristics offer at least two advantages: The existence of the group means the insurance company can underwrite a policy on its shared characteristics. Also, a central organization to administer the plan, enroll members, collect premiums, etc. 2.3.1.1 Employer \u00b6 Employer-employee groups are the most common type of group. The insurance provided is a valuable employee benefit and can act as an incentive for attracting better employees and keeping employees in the organization. Thus, many employers find it particularly important to offer employees competitive group coverage to engage and keep good employees. For the employee, it provides a simple, convenient and cost-efficient way to build a base for their risk management program. 2.3.1.2 Association \u00b6 Association groups refer to groups of individuals who belong to the same group insurance plan based on shared characteristics rather than working for the same employer. Two types of association groups exist: Groups of individuals who have employers in common: May be formed by several employers in the same industry or by franchise owners from the same franchise organization (for example, the beauty industry or a sandwich restaurant franchise); The employees are the plan members; The members access the benefits of belonging to a group DI plan (i.e., its cost-effectiveness). Groups of individuals who have professions/associations in common: May be formed by members of the same profession or belong to the same association (for example, doctors who belong to the Canadian Medical Association group plan or alumni from the University of Ottawa); Membership in the group plan is solicited by the plan administrator; No obligation to participate in the group plan; Members pay all of their own premiums and benefits; The members access the benefits of belonging to a group DI plan. 2.3.2 Types of group disability insurance (DI) policies \u00b6 Typically, disability coverage is divided into short-term disability and long-term disability. Each group contains several different: definitions of disability, benefit levels as well as waiting and benefit periods. 2.3.2.1 Short-term disability (STD) \u00b6 Short-term disability is also referred to as a weekly indemnity. It provides a benefit no longer than one year in duration. If disability persists after one year, short-term disability is replaced by long-term disability. STD benefits are based on a percentage of the insured\u2019s salary: The benefit amount is 70%-75% of salary; Benefits are taxable income because the employer pays the premium; Benefit is higher than LTD benefits. The benefit period begins: Seven days after disability caused by illness; The day that disability is caused by an accident. The own occupation definition of disability applies. Therefore, the benefit is paid if the disability of the life insured prevents him from working at his regular occupation. STD plans insuring lower-paid workers often coordinate with Employment Insurance (EI) so that the insured receives the benefits of EI or STD during their benefit period. Example The company Myron works for offers its employees\u2019 a group disability plan which includes both STD and LTD coverage, providing for a combined 5-year benefit period (12 months for STD and 48 months for LTD). Normally, Myron earns $4,000 a month, when working. A couple of months ago Myron injured himself when a golf cart that he was riding on during a weekend tournament tipped over and badly damaged his leg. Myron\u2019s job as a plant supervisor requires him to walk around the plant regularly to oversee the work of the employees, so his injury qualified him as \u201cdisabled\u201d under the \u201cown occupation\u201d definition of disability under his STD coverage. The plan provides a benefit equal to 70% of salary, so Myron will receive disability payments of $2,800 a month ( $4,000 \u00d7 70%) for up to 12 months or until he returns to work, whichever comes first. If Myron is still disabled after 12 months, his coverage will change from short-term disability to long-term disability. EI is often a second payor of disability coverage. The following way of staggering EI and STD benefits ensures that this dollar-for-dollar reduction of EI benefits is avoided: EI insurance has a maximum 15-week benefit period after a waiting period of one week ; When disability begins, the insured receives the STD benefit first-day benefit for one week \u2013 the waiting period of EI; When the EI benefit period initiates, the insured stops receiving STD benefits and begins receiving EI Benefits for a total of 15 weeks and then stops; The insured begins receiving the STD benefits at the beginning of week 17. 2.3.2.2 Long-term disability (LTD) \u00b6 LTD begins when STD ends and the plan member is still disabled. The STD benefit can be thought of as the waiting period for the LTD benefit. The insurance is structured with: LTD monthly benefits are generally lower than those paid under STD, typically between 50 and 60% of previous income, compared to 70 to 75% for STD; LTD benefits are generally payable for a period of 2 years, 5 years or 10 years, or to age 65; STD benefits are mosty taxable, whereas LTD benefits are non-taxable; The benefits are usually based on a \u201cown occupation\u201d definition of disability for the first 12 months of LTD, changing to \u201cany occupation\u201d definition thereafter. Example (Cont.) After 12 months Myron\u2019s leg still had not healed enough for him to return to his regular occupation as a mobile supervisor. He remained on disability claim, but now under the long-term disability coverage from the group plan. His monthly benefit was reduced from 70% to 60% of salary, from $2,800 a month to $2,400 a month. Example (Cont.) Myron\u2019s qualifying definition for disability would last for another 12 months, if the disability lasts that long, but will change to an \u201cany occupation\u201d definition at the end of month 24. By that time, Myron would be expected to take up another suitable occupation within the company, if possible. If a suitable alternative was available to him and he failed to take advantage of it, his benefits would stop. If he was unable to perform the duties of another suitable occupation, his benefits could continue for up to three more years, completing the 5-year benefit period that his group plan provides for a combined STD/LTD claim. 2.3.2.3 Disability During a Leave of absence \u00b6 A leave of absence is either paid or unpaid and refers to a period of time when the employee is away from work for any reason supported by the employer. The following are a few examples of leave of absence: To care of a terminally ill family member; To conduct independent research; Teachers may take their \u201cfour over five\u201d which refers to a voluntary arrangement when they earn 80% of their salary for 4 years and take a sabbatical fifth year off, still earning 80% of their salary. There is no consistent treatment for premiums or benefits if an employee (i.e., a group plan member) becomes disabled during a leave of absence. For example, some plans do not offer coverage if the insured becomes disabled during a leave of absence whereas others will provide coverage only if the group premiums are still being paid on a monthly basis. In most cases, the employee has to pay the premiums during his leave of absence. The insured must consult the group plan\u2019s master contract to see if he is covered during a leave of absence. 2.3.3 Plan enrolment and membership \u00b6 The group administrator enrolls new members, administers claims, removes ex-employees, and maintains all necessary records. 2.3.3.1 Qualification period \u00b6 The qualification period is the period of time between starting a job with a new employer and being able to enroll in the group plan. Most groups DI plans require a qualification period for new employees. It is often linked with the initial 30 to 90 days of employment, the probationary period when the employee can be fired without recourse. For example, Anthony begins work with AMF Resources on July 1. The AMF group insurance plan specifies a 90-day qualification period. By the end of September, Anthony has qualified to join the plan and AMF enrolls him. 2.3.3.2 Premium payment \u00b6 In a non-participating group DI plan (or non-par plan), the employer pays the total premium monthly on behalf of all employees. The employer pays for all of the coverage\u2014the employees do not contribute. In a participating group DI plan, the employees contribute to the premium. The sum is collected from each employee by payroll deduction. The employer makes the premium payment, which is a combination of the employee contributions and employer contributions. Association group plans usually pay their premium by direct withdrawal from a bank account. 2.3.3.3 Terminating membership \u00b6 Membership in a group plan may be terminated by a(n): Cancellation of the master contract by the employer or the insurance company; Employee ceasing to be an employee of the company; Employee failing to meet membership requirements (i.e., a reduction in weekly employment hours below the policy\u2019s weekly minimum amount of hours); Employee/group plan member retirement. The member may have a right to conversion of the group policy to an individual policy without necessarily having to provide medical evidence of insurability within 30 days of termination of membership in the group plan usually subject to certain restrictions. 2.3.4 Amount of benefit \u00b6 Group plan members will find the amount of disability benefit they receive is limited to: Non-evidence maximum\u2014the maximum benefit stated in the master contract regardless of the plan member\u2019s income; Maximum overall\u2014this additional benefit is based on a percentage of the group member\u2019s income; All sources maximum\u2014the maximum benefit from all sources stated in the master contract and set out by the group offset rules. Diagram 2.4 demonstrates the relationship between the different types of benefit amounts. Diagram 2.4: Group disability insurance benefit amounts 2.3.4.1 Non-evidence maximum coverage \u00b6 The non-evidence maximum coverage is in place to ensure that all group members receive a base level of benefits regardless of their income and health. No medical underwriting is required. This basic coverage is set in place taking into account the insurer\u2019s risk and plan sponsor\u2019s costs. 2.3.4.2 Maximum overall coverage \u00b6 The maximum overall coverage is in place for plan members who would like additional coverage on top of the basic non-evidence plan coverage. The maximum overall coverage has two main limits: Plan members must qualify financially for the additional coverage; Plan members must also undergo medical underwriting and fully pay for such additional coverage. The maximum monthly benefit is stated in the master group plan. Maximum monthly benefits are often tied to group size\u2014larger groups offer larger maximum monthly benefits whereas smaller groups offer a smaller amount. The maximum coverage a plan member will receive is based on whichever amount is less: the group plan maximum or a percentage of his income. The employer/employee can also take out coverage that is less than the maximum amount stated in the master contract. Example Chiang and Eng are members of the same employer-group DI program which provides for maximum long-term disability coverage of 60% of salary, or $5,000 a month, whichever is less. Chiang, who earns $90,000 a year, qualifies for a maximum benefit of $4,500 a month (( $90,000 \u00d7 60%) \u00f7 12). Eng, who earns $120,000 a year, is restricted to the maximum monthly benefit of $5,000, despite the fact that his income could qualify him for $6,000 monthly benefit (( $120,000 \u00d7 60%) \u00f7 12). Benefits can either be treated as taxable or non-taxable income. The percentage of earnings considered in setting the overall maximum coverage will depend on how the benefits are taxed: STD benefits are taxable and are usually in the higher percentage range, between 70 and 75% of pre-disability income; LTD benefits are generally non-taxable and are usually in the higher percentage range, between 60% to 66.66% of pre-disability income. Example Brandi works for a company that offers group DI coverage. The non-evidence maximum amount of LTD coverage is 50% of salary and the maximum benefit is set at 66.66% of salary, to a maximum of $10,000 a month. Brandi earns $90,000 a year and has elected to take full coverage of $60,000 (66.66% of $90,000 \u2013 $5,000 a month). The first $45,000 of annual coverage (50% of salary) would be provided on a non-evidence basis, but Brandi would have to qualify medically to add the additional $15,000 of coverage (16.66% of salary). 2.3.4.3 All-Sources Maximum (also sometimes called \u201cGroup offset amendment\u201d) \u00b6 The all-sources maximum is in place to ensure that the employee still has an incentive to return to work\u2014if the disabled individual receives benefits that match or exceed his pre-disability income he will not have a monetary incentive to return to work. The group offset amendment is stated in the group master contract. It indicates the all-sources maximum, in other words, the maximum in benefits available from all sources direct and indirect. Direct sources are plans that pay monetary benefits directly to the disabled member such as: CPP/QPP; Employment Insurance; Workers\u2019 Compensation; Auto insurance disability benefits; Association or other group benefits. Indirect sources are benefits paid to dependent spouses and children of the disabled life insured such as children\u2019s benefit paid by CPP. An individually-owned policy does not usually contribute to the all sources maximum, but such a policy may have its own offset rules. The maximum that can be received from all sources is 85% of pre-disability income. If the maximum is exceeded by a benefit or combination of benefits, the group plan benefit will be reduced to respect the 85% limit. Example Mr. Lee earns $60,000 a year as a plumber. He is employed with a company that provides an LTD benefit equal to 66.67% of its employees\u2019 regular, pre-disability income, or $3,333 a month (( $60,000 \u00d7 66.67%) \u00f7 12). In the event of disability, Mr. Lee could also qualify for benefits of $1,020 a month from a personal policy, for a total of $4,353 a month of benefits. This would represent benefits of $52,236 a year, or 87.1% of his regular income. The 87.1% exceeds the 85% all sources maximum specified in the group plan\u2019s master contract, so Mr. Lee\u2019s monthly benefit from the group plan would be offset by $103 a month ( $4,353 \u2013 (85% \u00d7 $60,000 \u00f7 12)) to an amount of $3,230, bringing the total monthly benefit from all sources to $4,250, or 85% of his pre-disability income level. 2.3.4.4 Denial of benefits \u00b6 Benefits will be denied for the same reasons benefits from a personal policy will be denied. See Section 2.2.2.5. Once a group member is no longer a member of the group, the group DI benefits will cease. 2.3.5 Taxation of group disability insurance benefits \u00b6 STD and LTD benefits received by the employee are taxable income when the employer pays the premium. The premium is a deductible expense for the employer. However, if the group member pays 100% of the LTD premium, the benefit is received by the employee tax-free. The premium is not a tax-deductible expense for the employee. If both the employer and group member contribute to the LTD premium, the benefit received by the employee, up to his total amount of premium contribution, is tax-free. Benefits greater than premiums paid are taxable income: The premium contribution by the employer is a deductible expense; The premium contribution by the employee is not a deductible expense. Example Matti is a member of a group DI plan where the employer and the employee share the premium cost for all group benefits on a 50/50 basis. Up until now, Matti has never made a claim against the LTD benefits available under the plan. However, this year he was injured and ended up receiving a total of $17,000 in group LTD benefits. To date, Matti and his employer had shared the $8,200 in total premium paid on his behalf for the LTD coverage. For tax purposes, $4,100 of Matti\u2019s benefits (his 50% of the $8,200 of total premiums paid) would be a tax-free refund of premiums and the other $12,900 ( $17,000 - $4,100) would be treated as taxable income. Table 2.3 illustrates a summary of the tax consequences to the recipient of benefits, based on the person or entity that pays the premiums for the disability coverage. 2.3.6 Integrating a group policy with an individual policy \u00b6 Clients can rely on both group and individual insurance simultaneously in order to meet their needs. An individual may choose to supplement the benefit amount or improve the benefit period of a group policy with an individual policy. - Benefit amount A person who is covered by a group policy may find its benefit inadequate for his financial needs. Typically, STD coverage is 70\u201375% and LTD coverage is 60\u201366.66% of pre-disability income. He could take out a personal disability income policy with an extended benefit to reach a level of benefit more suitable to his circumstances. The individual DI policy would have the same definition of disability as well as the same benefit and waiting period as the group DI plan. The 85% all sources maximum must be respected. Otherwise, offsets might void some of the advantage of the extra coverage, leaving the client paying for coverage from which he could never benefit. Claims are filed against the group policy first (as \u201cfirst payor\u201d) and then against the personally owned plan, where there is an overlap in coverage. Example Andre\u2019s group policy offers LTD coverage of 60% of his $80,000 annual salary, or $4,000 a month of benefits ( $80,000 \u00d7 60% \u00f7 12). He would be more comfortable with a 75% benefit level, or $5,000 a month ( $80,000 \u00d7 75% \u00f7 12). He could supplement his group coverage by taking out an individual DI policy paying $1,000 a month of disability benefit, but otherwise on the same basis as the group plan. - Benefit period - A group benefit period can be extended by an individual policy. - The insured purchases an individual DI policy with the same definition of disability and benefits as the group plan but with an extended benefit period. - The waiting period of the individual policy would become the benefit period of the group policy. Example Amir has a group policy with a 60-day waiting period and a two-year benefit period (a total of 26 months). He applies for a policy with a 26-month waiting period and a five-year benefit period. The long waiting period reduces the premium for his personal policy. 2.4 Creditor Disability Insurance (and Other Providers) \u00b6 Creditors who belong to the same financial institution represent another group association classification. Lenders (i.e., credit unions, banks, etc.) will often collaborate with a life insurance company to provide group DI coverage to protect debtors in the case of a disability \u2013 the DI insurance will make the scheduled payments towards the debt when the debtor cannot earn an income and is disabled. Creditor disability insurance is often provided as a package deal and is included with the loan itself. Benefits are received by the creditor tax-free. The premium for a creditor disability insurance policy is not tax-deductible unless the loan has been taken for the purpose of earning income from a business or property. Creditor disability insurance uses the \u201ctotal disability\u201d definition i.e., the inability to earn income due to an illness or an injury. Typically, no medical underwriting is done at the time of the application. However, at the time of the claim, the insured may be retroactively underwritten. There is a waiting period, generally 60 days. Policy premiums and the monthly loan payments are combined \u2013 the benefits are thus debited to the account that provides the loan payment. 2.4.1 Amount of benefit \u00b6 Group creditor DI benefits are connected to the insured\u2019s agreement to make monthly payments towards the unpaid balance of the insured loan. Generally, the benefit is calculated as a percentage of the remaining balance, taking into account the maximum allowable monthly and overall limit. Example A bank offers mortgage disability insurance that will pay a maximum benefit equal to the monthly principal and interest payments on the mortgage, to a maximum of $3,000 a month for 24 months. It also offers credit card coverage with a maximum benefit of the lesser of 3% of the balance and $600 a month, capped at an overall limit of $20,000. 2.4.2 Taxation of creditor disability insurance benefits \u00b6 The tax treatment of group creditor DI premiums is easy to grasp, receiving the same tax treatment as individual disability insurance: Personal premiums paid are a non-deductible expense. However, the premiums paid are a deductible expense if they are business-related (i.e., a business or investment loan); Benefits are received and paid to the creditor on the debtor\u2019s behalf tax-free. 2.5 How They Compare \u00b6 There are similarities, differences, advantages and disadvantages to the three different categories of disability protection: individual, group and creditor insurance. Table 2.4 summarizes compares and contrasts these characteristics.","title":"Chapter 2 Insurance to Protect Income"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_2_Insurance_to_Protect_Income/#chapter-2-insurance-to-protect-income","text":"","title":"Chapter 2: Insurance to Protect Income"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_2_Insurance_to_Protect_Income/#21-sources-of-income-protection","text":"Disability income (DI) insurance replaces income due to the inability to work.

Typically, at age 65, the policyholder has an option to convert the policy, without proof of insurability, to a guaranteed renewable contract with a shortened benefit period generally ranging from a year or two. Premiums are based on the insured\u2019s age when the policy is converted. The guaranteed renewable policy typically ends when the life insured is 72 or 75.

A cancellable policy is issued to higher-risk occupations (i.e., labourers, taxi drivers, etc.). Because of the lack of long-term certainty for the policyholder, all other factors being equal, premiums for cancellable contracts will be lower than those for guaranteed renewable policies, which, in turn, have lower premiums than non-cancellable and guaranteed renewable policies.

It is an alternative to traditional long-term disability (LTD) group insurance.

The insurer can cancel the guaranteed aspect of the plan at any time by refusing to accept any further lives insured on a guaranteed basis. At the time of the application, applicants must be actively at work and not on a disability claim. Due to the plan\u2019s guaranteed nature, the guaranteed issue policies may incur certain restrictions based on the: Size of the group; Occupational category of the group members; Minimum annual premium commitment; Minimum average age for the group members. There are two forms of guaranteed issue plans. Guaranteed standard risk: Coverage is guaranteed to be issued without coverage restrictions or premium ratings; Often there will be extra restrictions based on the plan\u2019s administration such as every member of the group may be required to participate or that 100% of the premiums must be fully paid by the employer; The reason every member has to participate is to avoid anti-selection which refers to when an imbalance occurs in the risk levels presented by employees. A potential unbalance could occur if only higher-risk employees subscribed for the plan and lower-risk members opted out of the insurance. Guaranteed-to-issue: Coverage is based on medical underwriting. These plans guarantee to issue some form of coverage though not exactly the coverage applied for; Non-standard risks (that is people who pose a higher degree of risk than standard risk) may pay a higher premium, called a rated premium or issue an exclusion rider; If an individual poses a higher risk due to a particular hobby or activity, coverage may exclude a claim that arises from that hobby or activity.

In the 21 st century, there has been a significant growth of self-employed workers in Canada. By 2019, 15.2% of Canadian workers were self-employed contract workers. These changes have had a significant impact on disability insurance and the main market of employees for which it has traditionally provided DI insurance. Insurance products must align themselves with the changing work market. Employers typically do not provide benefits for contract workers. Contract workers often seek out standard disability coverage but find that sickness coverage is not practical because it is too expensive/requires too long a waiting period to be beneficial. Contract workers prefer an affordable accident and sickness policy that would initiate immediately upon accident or illness (i.e., first-day benefits). Many insurers have made the accident and sickness elements of their DI policies distinct and separate. This policy insures against the loss of income due to either accident or sickness (but not both). Other insurers are changing the definition of disability to better suit the changing market: For example, changing the definition of total disability to the inability to perform specified functions instead of job duties. This new definition includes the work of the self-employed contract worker because workers who are not employees offer skills to a workplace instead of services and duties outlined in an employee contract; For example, offering an income-based definition of disability which bases disability on the inability to earn a specified percentage of regular income due to disability. This definition also acknowledges that job services often differ between contracts; For example, changing the definition of disability to the inability to find new contracts due to disability, thus offering disability benefits to unemployed self-employed contract workers. Some plans offer special benefits to an insured who may not have gainful employment such as an individual who provides full-time care to their children or who perform volunteer service. These policies provide the insured with limited monthly benefits to \u201ccontract out\u201d the services the insured was providing in the past such as babysitting, volunteering, etc.","title":"2.2.1.5 Non-traditional disability insurance plans"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_2_Insurance_to_Protect_Income/#222-individual-policy-benefits","text":"Individual disability insurance is more involved than simply providing monthly income benefits to insured members who meet the policy\u2019s definition of disabled.

In such cases, DI insurance potentially gives an individual the opportunity of earning an income without the need to actually work. Disability benefits from individually owned DI policies are tax-free; The maximum benefit of a DI policy is typically no more than 60% of pre-tax active income (that is income earned from performing actual work). It is not 100% of income because the disability benefit takes into account income tax and other benefits normally applicable to business income; This is easy to calculate when an individual solely earns a salary/self-employment income. Therefore, the formula for the disability benefit based on active income is: Pre-tax income \u00d7 percentage of DI coverage = disability benefit based on earned income Example 1 John earns $100,000 per year. His income of $100,000 is taxed at about 40%; his take-home pay is $60,000. His disability benefit would pay $60,000 and he would not pay tax on the $60,000. Example 2 Heinrich is a sole proprietor, working as a consulting computer technician. Most years, he earns $70,000 in consulting fees and has about $12,000 in business expenses which are only incurred if he is working. After allowing for income taxes annually, he gets to keep roughly $38,000 of the $70,000 that he earns. Based on his pre-tax income of $70,000, less $12,000 of deductible business expenses, an insurance company would offer him maximum DI coverage of about \\(34,800 ([\\) 70,000 - $12,000] \u00d7 60%). This is close to the $38,000 that he gets to keep, after-tax, while he is working. He is financially neither advantaged nor disadvantaged if he is on a disability claim, minimizing the chances that he would submit a false claim or artificially prolong a valid claim in order to continue receiving an income without working. It is more difficult to calculate the disability benefit if the insured has sources of passive income (income not earned by performing work) on top of his earned income that continues during a period of disability. Passive income can include earned or passive income of a spouse or family member, investment income, or cash flow that will continue if the insured is disabled. Insurers treat the continual, passive income as part of the disability benefit and reduce the disability coverage accordingly. If the insured were to receive the disability benefit in addition to their passive income, they will have little incentive to go back to work. The reduced disability benefit avoids such situations. In this case, the total income will be reduced by the passive income and the percentage of DI coverage (maximum of 60%) will be based on the final sum. Therefore, the formula to calculate the disability benefit, taking into account passive income that continues during a period of disability is: (Earned income + non-earned income) \u00d7 percentage of DI coverage \u2013 non earned income = disability benefit based on earned and non-earned income Example 2 (Cont.) Consider the case of Heinrich, above. Assume that, in addition to his earned income of $70,000 a year, he has income from a family trust of $20,000 a year, income that will be paid to him whether he is working or not. If the insurance company were to ignore the trust income and issue him $34,800 (or 60% of ( \\(70,000\u2015\\) 12,000)) of disability protection, during a period of disability, he would receive $34,800 a year from the insurance company and $20,000 from the trust\u2014or $54,800 a year of total income\u2014almost 78% of his gross, pre-disability earned income as a consulting computer technician. There would be little incentive for Heinrich to return to work. Even if the insurance company were to include the $20,000 of trust income in Heinrich\u2019s computation of \u201cearned income\u201d, he would end up being over-insured; 60% of Heinrich\u2019s total income of $70,000 ( $58,000 net in fees plus $20,000 from the trust) equals $46,800 a year in disability benefits. However, Heinrich would still be receiving the full $20,000 from the trust, making his total income $66,800 while on the disability claim. This would represent about 86% of Heinrich\u2019s pre-disability income, well in excess of the 60% threshold that would place him in a neutral position. Example 2 (Cont.) In this case, the insurer would be willing to insure a benefit equal to 60% of Heinrich\u2019s total pre-disability income of $78,000, or $46,800. However, the coverage offered would then be reduced by the $20,000 of trust income that he would still be receiving while disabled, leaving a DI benefit of $26,800. The combination of the disability benefit and the trust income would then total $46,800, or 60% of Heinrich\u2019s total pre-disability income of $78,000.","title":"2.2.2.1 Amount of benefit"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_2_Insurance_to_Protect_Income/#2222-waiting-period","text":"The waiting period is the time between becoming disabled (onset of disability) and receiving a benefit. It is also called the elimination period. The waiting period can be as short as zero days, or as long as 12 months. 90 days is the norm. The longer the waiting period, the lower the premium. The least risky occupational classes receive the shortest waiting periods. All factors being equal, policies with a shorter waiting periods charge higher insurance premiums. Benefits are not paid during the waiting period. The waiting period is in place to avoid paying for disabilities of a very short-term nature. These short-term temporary disabilities are too expensive for the insurance company to pay in terms of administrative costs for the short duration of the disability. Example Alfred injured his leg in a fall while hiking on the weekend. He was unable to work for 8 months. His DI policy has a 90-day waiting period and a maximum 24-month benefit period. Because of the waiting period, the insurer paid out 5 months of benefits (8 months of disability less the 3-month waiting period) rather than the full 8 months.","title":"2.2.2.2 Waiting period"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_2_Insurance_to_Protect_Income/#2223-benefit-period","text":"The benefit period is the maximum length of time benefits are paid by the policy.

Misstatement of material fact on the insurance application: If an insured makes a false statement or a material misrepresentation, meaning he misrepresented or forgot a fact that would have affected the underwriting of the policy and this is discovered within two years of the policy issue date, the policy can be made void (i.e., declared legally invalid) by the insurance company. The two-year period is called the contestability period because after two years, the policy becomes incontestable. The contract is potentially voided based on the notion that if all the information and facts were initially accurately presented to the insurance company, the policy might never have been put in force in the first place. For example, failure to disclose a previous back injury that could have impacted the underwriting decision is a misstatement. Fraud: Fraud is when the insured attempts to, or is successful at, deceiving the insurance company in order to receive a policy or pay a lower premium. If the misrepresentation was made by mistake (i.e., the applicant forgot about a health factor and honestly assumed it was not important to disclose), then no fraud is presumed to have taken place. Fraud always voids a policy regardless of when it is discovered. A false claim refers to when an insured commits fraud at the time of a claim.

Absence of loss: Benefits are only payable under a disability claim if the claim is both proven to be valid and there is evidence of income loss due to disability. The life insured must show income to substantiate his claim. If his income when he makes a claim was lower than the amount he was insured for, the claim will be adjusted to reflect the actual (lower) income;=. For example, if the individual is unemployed or has a reduced income when making the disability claim, his benefits will be potentially reduced or denied altogether. Example Haroon took out a disability income replacement policy in 2009 when he was earning $60,000 a year, which, if disabled, would pay him a $3,000 monthly benefit equal to 60% of his income ((12 \u00d7 $3,000) \u00f7 $60,000). By 2014, Haroon had lost his former job and was now working for a different employer at a reduced salary of $48,000 a year. If Haroon was to become disabled now, his maximum monthly benefit would be only $2,400 a month equivalent to 60% of his current salary ( $48,000 \u00d7 60% \u00f7 12). Absence of proof: Medical proof of disability must accompany a claim that he is, in fact, disabled and unable to work (an individual cannot just say he is disabled and receive a disability benefit). A prolonged period of disability will require ongoing proof. The insurer will at the very least request a medical report from the insured\u2019s doctor. The insurer might additionally request a medical exam and/or other tests from a physician chosen by the insurer. Delay in filing a claim: A claim must be filed no later than 90 days after the disability occurs, or by the deadline specified by the insurance company in the policy. Insurers have the right to deny benefits if a claim is not made in time. In an ideal situation, the insured should contact the insurer right away following the beginning of the disabling condition.","title":"2.2.2.5 Denial of benefits"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_2_Insurance_to_Protect_Income/#2226-rehabilitation-benefit","text":"It is best for all parties involved if the disabled insured returns back to work as soon as the insured can safely and practically work again: The insured will begin earning his full salary again; The employer will regain the insured\u2019s skills and services; The insurance company will no longer have to pay the claim. Rehabilitation is not mandatory under DI policies but it is highly encouraged by the insurance company and is thus often reimbursed fully or partially by the insurer. The policy will outline the amount of rehabilitation services that are covered under the insurance policy as well as a potential maximum dollar limit available for rehabilitation services. If the life insured plans to use one or more rehabilitation services, he must submit his plan to the company for pre-approval of the cost(s). Rehabilitative services provided for rehabilitation are the following (but are not limited to): Physiotherapy; Occupational training; Medical treatment; Job placement; Psychotherapy.","title":"2.2.2.6 Rehabilitation benefit"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_2_Insurance_to_Protect_Income/#2227-benefits-for-recurring-disability","text":"Recurring disability occurs when a life insured returns to work after an absence due to disability only to have the disability, attributed to the same cause, reoccur. The life insured then stops working due to his disability and goes back on disability leave. In this case, the disabled worker could potentially be subject to two lengthy waiting periods without any payable benefits in a short period of time\u2014a waiting period for the first disability instance and another waiting period when the disability reoccurs. Example Ophelia injured her back in January of 2014, in a fall on ice in the parking lot of the office where she works. She was off work for five months, collecting disability benefits for two of those months after allowing for the 90-day waiting period under her DI coverage. Two months after returning to work she was forced to take time off again, another four months in this instance, as sitting at her computer chair all day long aggravated her previous back injury. If she was required to undergo another 90-day waiting period for the second instance of disability, she would have received only three months of benefits during a period when she was disabled for nine months out of eleven. The recurrent disability clause in many DI contracts is designed to prevent the insured from having to undergo another waiting period when a disability reoccurs. For most policies, if the second instance of disability, resulting from the same clause, occurs within six months after returning to work, the situation is treated as one instance of disability and the second waiting period will not apply. The disability must be a recurrence of the original health condition; it cannot be a new condition. Example (Cont.) In Ophelia\u2019s case, above, if her policy contained a recurring disability clause, she would not be subject to a second waiting period and her benefits would recommence immediately upon the onset of the second instance of disability, incurred after only two months back on the job. As such, she would receive six months\u2019 worth of benefits during the eleven-month period, not merely three. The disadvantage to a recurring disability clause is that the two or more periods of recurring disability can be treated as one benefit period without any interruption. Therefore, the disability benefit is calculated from the beginning of the first benefit period. If the benefit period is shorter (i.e., two to five years), this could greatly affect the total amount of benefits received due to a disability that lasts for an extended period of time. This also means that benefits could potentially run out before the end of the second disability period. Example Ryan hurts his back in a skiing accident. His disability policy has: A 24-month benefit period; A 90-day waiting period. Ryan is approved for his disability claim and after 90 days receives his first benefit. Six months later Ryan returns to work, and after two months finds he is unable to work due to back pain from the accident. He begins to receive his policy benefit again. It begins immediately; there is no waiting period. He has 18 months remaining in benefits (i.e., the 24-month policy benefit minus 6 months\u2019 benefit received), not 24, because of the benefits received under the first claim were deducted from his remaining benefit period.","title":"2.2.2.7 Benefits for recurring disability"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_2_Insurance_to_Protect_Income/#2228-benefits-for-presumptive-disability","text":"A presumptive disability refers to when the insured suffers from a specified type of disability or the injury is so severe that the individual is presumed to be disabled.

Presumptive disabilities include: Total and Irreversible loss of hearing; Total and Irreversible loss of sight; Loss of limbs, or loss of the use of limbs, including both arms, both legs, and an arm and leg; and Total and permanent loss of speech. The benefits start immediately even if the insured can return to work and fulfill all of his previous duties as well as receive his full salary right away. Therefore, loss of income does not have to be proven to receive the disability benefit (as is the case with most disability benefits).

Upon proof of death, the sum is paid in a lump sum and is usually three times the monthly benefit. Example ABC insurance pays David $3,000 a month for his disability benefit while he is unable to work due to injury. David suddenly dies in the middle of his disability claim.

But the length of time they are disabled is shorter than for older people. Therefore: It is likely that men will pay lower DI premium than women of the same age group for the same coverage; Younger applicants will likely pay lower DI premium than older applicants. Table 2.2 demonstrates the risk of becoming completely disabled before age 65 for more than 90 days and the average duration of the disability. It may be noted from above that the probability of disability is greater among those who are 25 years old than for those who have already reached 45, though the average duration of disability is longer for those who have reached 45 years of age.

Family issues will also be a concern when there is a genetic link to the life insured. For example, when health conditions are likely to run in the family such as having more than one family member with breast cancer. Premiums and benefits are classified as: Standard Life - reflecting the same degree of risk as the average individual; Rated - reflecting a higher degree of risk than the average individual; Uninsurable - reflecting an unacceptable degree of risk. If an applicant has health issues, an exclusion of coverage for specified causes of disability may be offered. The applicant will receive the same standard premium and benefits if he lives an average life and thus likely faces the same risks of disability as the average individual. The applicant will be denied insurance or will be subject to higher premiums, which do not include coverage for particular causes of disability, if the applicant has a history of health complications (or is still injured/ill). If an applicant files a disability claim within one year of the application, the condition that led to that claim may be classified as a \u201cpre-existing condition.\u201d Insurers often state in DI policies that, under a one-year exclusion rider, any pre-existing conditions may be excluded from the coverage for the year following the issue of the policy.

A disability may be \u201cpartial\u201d or \u201ctotal\u201d and, within that range, four distinct definitions are used in different policies. Different definitions of disability are used by different policies. Typically, the disability\u2019s cause is not considered in the definition. Workers\u2019 Compensation coverage which deals solely with work-related injuries and illnesses is the exception and takes into account the disability\u2019s cause. The four main definitions of disability used in DI are: Own occupation; Regular occupation; Any occupation; and Total disability (according to the CPP). Partial disability will be defined and examined later in this chapter. Own Occupation The own occupation definition of disability is the most liberal in that it is the easiest under which to qualify as being disabled\u2014the insured is seen as completely disabled if he cannot carry out his main work tasks, even part time. The insured never has to return to work post-disability if he cannot perform the primary duties of his regular occupation\u2014he returns to work once he can perform all the main duties of his regular occupation. Furthermore, he can take another job in another occupation and continue to receive his disability benefit. This type of policy is only available to the highest classification of occupants \u2013 those who are least likely to make a claim, such as doctors, lawyers, dentists, etc. \u201cOwn occupation\u201d carries the highest premium due to: The generous benefits provided to the life insured; and the larger policy purchased by high-income professionals who qualify for a cheaper rate/$100. These individuals are the least likely to need to file claims and tend not to stay on claim as long as other occupation classes, who earn less and, therefore, have to purchase smaller policy coverage. Example Tobias worked as a surgeon, earning $240,000 a year. Four years ago, he was injured in his home workshop and lost all the dexterity in his right hand. As a consequence, he can no longer function as a surgeon. After rehabilitation, Tobias took up a position at the local medical school, teaching other surgeons the techniques that he had developed. He also travels on the lecture circuit and has published two books since his accident. In total, he now earns $300,000 a year from his various enterprises but, since he can no longer function as a surgeon, he continues to receive benefits under his DI policy, which has an \u201cown occupation\u201d definition of disability. Regular Occupation The regular occupation definition uses the same definition and has the same implications as own occupation except if the life insured takes another job, the disability benefit may be reduced or ended. The decision about returning to work is made only by the life insured\u2014even if he is physically able. Also available to those who are least likely to make a claim. Has a lower premium than own occupation. Any Occupation The any occupation definition of disability is applicable when the insured is seen as disabled if he is ill/injured and thus cannot carry out some or all of the functions associated with his regular occupation and he is not able to carry out the functions of any other occupation that would be suitable for him based on his education or experience. This is the most stringent definition of disability since there are so many potential occupations for which the insured might still be capable of performing (and the insured\u2019s ability to perform the duties of any suitable occupation disqualifies him from being classified as \u201cdisabled\u201d). This type of policy is available to the greatest number of individuals, including those in higher-risk occupational classes. It is expected that the life insured who cannot work in his regular occupation will become employed in another job as a suitable alternative to his regular occupation or benefits may cease. This type of DI policy has the lowest DI premium. Total Disability according to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Total disability is the definition used by the Canada Pension Plan. The definition applies when the insured is totally unable to work at any job that he is suited for by his education and experience. It entails that the insured will likely never recover and be able to return to employment (i.e., severe and prolonged) and may likely die from the cause of the medical condition. This definition is rarely used by conventional group or individual DI policies. However, it is used more often in creditor insurance coverage. Exception \u2013 In Qu\u00e9bec, the Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP) defines total disability in slightly different terms: the disability must be seen as serious (inability to hold any employment on a full-time basis) as well as permanent (last indefinitely, without any chance of getting better).","title":"2.2.3.3 Definitions of disability"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_2_Insurance_to_Protect_Income/#2234-occupational-clause","text":"Some occupations are riskier than others and those who work in them are more likely to make claims. In underwriting disability insurance, the applicant\u2019s occupation is taken into consideration in terms of: The applicant\u2019s insurability; The policy type available; The riders and benefits available; The cost (premium level) for the coverage. Higher-risk occupations may not be offered policy types or benefits offered to those in lower-risk occupations. Life insurance companies categorize occupations by the risk of claims being made. These are called occupational classes. The following are the most common forms of classification: 4A \u2013 Professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, dentists and senior executives; 3A \u2013 Administrative office workers who face few, if any, workplace hazards, such as clerical staff; 2A \u2013 Supervisors in low-risk environments, salespersons and like occupations; A \u2013 Skilled manual workers who face few or no workplace hazards, or those working, for instance, as courier truck drivers; B \u2013 Manual labourers who work in hazardous environments, such as home construction workers. A lower premium would be available to the 4A occupation than the 3A occupation for the same coverage, lower premium for 3A vs. 2A, etc. Certain policy types/benefits would not be available to those in higher-risk classifications. For example, an applicant in the A class would not be able to likely get an own occupation coverage. Most DI contracts have an occupational clause that if a life insured changes to a riskier occupation, he may find his premiums increase or his benefits are reduced. The reverse is also true: if a new job has less risk than the old, the life insured can ask for a higher classification. At the underwriting stage, those in higher-risk categories may qualify for better consideration if they meet requirements for job and income stability. Even though the insured continues in a higher-risk occupation, an upgrade would equate to a lower premium. A medical underwriting would be necessary to confirm that the insured has not developed into a higher risk for reasons other than his occupation. Example Eunice took out a disability income replacement policy when she worked as an administrator in the office of a printing factory, a 3A classification. She paid $225 a month. Five years later, Eunice changed jobs with the same employer and is now working as a staff supervisor on the floor of the printing plant, an A classification job.

The premium for a disability income policy is waived (that is, not applied): When the life insured is receiving the disability benefit or; To the end of the benefit period/to when the life insured reaches 65 years (whichever comes first). The terms of the contract determine if the waiver of premium applies to the disability. Some policies only apply a waiver of premium involving total disability and sometimes partial disability. How does it work? Generally, the policyholder continues to pay the premium for the disability income policy for 90 days after he is totally disabled. After this period, the waiver commences.

FPO gives the insured the right to increase the benefit at future times or on the policy anniversary without proof of insurability. However, the benefit payment can never exceed 60% of pre-disability earned income. Thus, if the coverage currently in force is 60% of pre-disability income, no further coverage can be purchased, even though the right to purchase coverage without medical evidence is guaranteed. In the past, around every two years, the insured was given the option to increase his coverage. Now, the policies issued offer the options to increase on the anniversary of the policy. Any new coverage attained under the FPO is issued based on the life insured\u2019s attained age at the time the option is exercised. Depending on the contract, options are usually available up to the life insured\u2019s age of 50 or 55. The way in which attained age is calculated depends on the contract terms (i.e., on age on last birthday, age on next birthday or age nearest a birthday). There is a maximum amount of coverage that can be purchased per option and overall: Each option is often limited to 20% of base coverage to a maximum of $1,500 a month of new coverage; The overall limit is in the range of two to five times the initial amount of coverage under the base policy. If the insured has remained in the same occupation, new coverage obtained through the FPO is based on the same occupational class as the original policy. The contract may allow the FPO to go into effect right away or the exercise may be put off until the current claim\u2019s termination if the life insured is on disability claim when the option arises. The main limit in using the FPO is that the insured must qualify for the extra coverage from a financial perspective. The insured must provide the insurer with a proof of their current income. Exercising the FPO increases coverage which in turn increases the premium. In terms of an FPO, no further coverage can be bought if the coverage currently in force is equal to 60% of earned income (despite the fact that the right to buy coverage without medical evidence is guaranteed). Two rules are applicable: The current option may not be exercised if the current income of the insured has stayed the same since policy issue or exercise of the last option, and the coverage currently in force equates to 60% of current income. If the 60% of the current income of the insured is greater than the current coverage in force, the option may be exercised to a maximum of the current option or an amount that would bring the coverage up to 60% of current income, whichever is less. Example Fritz was earning $60,000 a year, net as a freelance handyman two years ago when he applied for disability insurance. He qualified medically and financially and was issued a DI policy with coverage of $3,000 a month ((60% \u00d7 $60,000) \u00f7 12). His policy has an FPO rider which permits him to increase coverage, guaranteed, by 20% of his original coverage (or $600 a month), this year if he can qualify financially. His income has increased by $6,000, to $66,000 a year. At his new income level, Fritz could qualify financially for $3,300 a month of disability coverage ((60% \u00d7 $66,000) \u00f7 12). Since he already holds $3,000 a month of coverage, he could only exercise the FPO to acquire an additional $300 a month of coverage, despite the fact that the option allows for up to $600 a month of coverage without medical underwriting.","title":"2.2.4.3 Future purchase option (FPO)"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_2_Insurance_to_Protect_Income/#2244-cost-of-living-adjustment-cola","text":"Inflation increases the cost of living. Those who depend on long-term disability benefits as income will find that, over time, their purchasing power is reduced due to inflation and the fixed nature of the disability benefit. This is a problem that insured\u2019s face who depend on LTD benefits as their primary source of income. The cost of living adjustment (COLA) rider increases the monthly benefit being paid under a disability income replacement contract annually, beginning in the second year benefits are paid. The increase is either: Simple: The benefit is indexed by a set percentage increase (e.g., 2.00% or 4.00%) of the initial benefit payable; Compound: Following the claim\u2019s first year, on a compound basis, the benefit is indexed to the rate of inflation and is thus increased by the CPI every year. In other words, the monthly benefit is increased based on the inflation rate for the previous calendar opposed to the initial benefit. Example Jennifer is entitled to $3,000 a month in benefits under a DI policy indexed to the CPI and under which the COLA is compounded. The following table demonstrates how her monthly benefit will increase every year due to the compounded COLA. Some policies limit a maximum annual indexing rate (i.e., 5%). Many policies may also carry forward an unused allotment to future years: For example, if the indexing rate for year 4 of a claim is 1.5% lower than the maximum allowed under the contract, that 1.5% can be carried forward to years in the future, to create more indexing room for years when the inflation rate exceeds the maximum annual indexing permitted under the contract. Furthermore, policies put in place a predetermined limit for the maximum amount of indexing so that the annual benefit paid out under an indexed policy does not surpass two or three times the initial, un-indexed, annual benefit. An automatic coverage enhancement, also called an automatic benefit increase, is an alternative (not an addition) to the COLA rider offered by some DI policies. Every year the benefit automatically increases, without a medical or financial underwriting, by a small fixed percentage (i.e., 2 or 3%) and the premium increases in step with the enhanced benefit. The enhancement may be reviewed and underwritten on a periodic basis (i.e., every 5 years). The benefit provides an indexed policy with increasing premiums that applies the increase in coverage after the policy is issued and does not wait for a claim to be made.

This is due to the fact that if the insured would receive full benefits in the event of total disability but no benefits if he were to return into the workforce part-time\u2014it would be hard to encourage a disabled worker to return to work part-time. - Residual disability benefits Residual disability benefits encourage disabled workers to return to the workplace as soon as they are physically able. A residual disability benefit is a type of partial benefit offered by many DI policies. This means that if the insured is able to work part-time following a total disability period, the disabled will receive a portion of his benefits. The life insured must first experience total disability (a complete inability to work) for a specified minimum amount of time including the waiting period (typically 6 months including the waiting period) to qualify for a residual disability benefit. When total disability has ceased, the benefit is paid if the disabled can return to work and perform some substantial duties or can perform all substantial duties some of the time. Therefore, once the insured returns back to work, he will be receiving two forms of income\u2014both, part of the disability benefit and the employment income. In order for an insured to qualify for residual benefits, there are specific requirements regarding both the insured\u2019s minimum and maximum income: Pre-disability income must be reduced by 20% or more to receive the benefit; In other words, if the life insured earns 80% or more of his pre-disability income, he will not receive the residual benefit; Therefore, if he earns between 20% and 80% of what he earned working, he receives a benefit in proportion to the percentage of income not received; The life insured will receive the full benefit if he earns 20% or less of his pre-disability income. There are three steps to determine the total income received by taking the residual benefit: Determine the percentage of income that is lost which is calculated as: Apply the percentage of income that is lost against the full disability benefit received which is calculated as: Full benefit x % of income lost = residual benefit Add the residual benefit to income earned = income received which is calculated as: Residual benefit + income earned = income received Example Carol\u2019s pre-disability active income is $100,000.

The percentage of income that she has lost by returning to work is: She has lost 76% of her pre-disability income. Step 2: How much will she receive as a residual benefit? Apply the percentage of income she has lost against the full disability benefit received: Full benefit x % of income lost = $5,000 \u00d7 76% = $3,800 She will receive $3,800 per month as a residual disability benefit. Step 3: What is her total income as a result of returning to work? Add the residual benefit to income earned: - Residual benefit + income earned = $3,800 + $2,000 = $5,800 Carol\u2019s total monthly income will be $5,800. Therefore, she receives more income as a result of working part-time than on the disability benefit alone. - Partial disability benefits - Partial disability benefits are paid by insurance contracts from the beginning of disability. - This does not require a proof of total disability. When due to disability, the insured cannot perform some of his job\u2019s principal duties (or can only perform them for part of the time), the policy provides the insured with 50% of his total disability benefit for a specific period of two to three years. The benefits come from the partial disability benefit or the residual disability benefit\u2014whichever is greater. The DI contracts generally ask that: The insured be under the care of a physician; The insured undergoes an initial qualification period of total disability before the partial disability benefits will be paid to the insured; Partial disability benefits vary between insurance companies\u2014the agent must ensure that the policy details are clear to an applicant.","title":"2.2.4.6 Partial and residual disability benefits"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_2_Insurance_to_Protect_Income/#2247-return-of-premium-rop","text":"A policyholder may pay thousands of dollars of premiums over the course of their DI policy and never receive any of the money because they never needed to file a valid claim. The return of premium (ROP) rider addresses this concern and provides a tax-free refund of premiums paid if, when the policy expires, total claims paid are less than total premiums paid. For example: If by age 65, no valid claims have been paid, the insured will receive 70% of all premiums paid; If the total claims paid during the policy\u2019s lifetime are less than the total amount of premiums paid, the difference would be paid back to the insured upon the maturity date of the coverage; If the claims paid out to the insured surpass the amount of premiums paid, then no return of premiums is payable. Some policies state that the rider may also apply if a policy is cancelled before its expiration date and no claims have been paid out on the policy. In this case, a partial ROP is often paid.

A premium rating is an increased premium which assumes substandard risks and compensates the insurance company for the additional risk it assumes. The premium rating does assume more risks than what is considered standard but, on the other hand, it does not assume risks that are too high either. For example, an insured with an overall health issue such as diabetes will have to pay a premium rating to compensate the insurance company for the risk it assumes taking on a client with a health condition. The insured may have the option to have a medical assessment in order to have the option re-underwritten as well as the rating lowered or taken off altogether if the condition improves in the future. An exclusion rider will exclude a claim arising from a substandard risk such as a particular lifestyle, activity or condition that has a greater risk of causing a disability. For example, a scuba diver has a greater risk of becoming disabled than someone who does not scuba dive. Therefore, scuba diving would most likely be excluded from the rider. In these cases, the insurance company will issue the policy but with an exclusion rider, excluding the particular risky activity from the policy so that if a disability does arise from the identified activity it will not be paid. Typically, the contract would then be issued with a standard premium in order for other standard episodes of disability to be covered by the rider. Example Eldridge applied for disability income replacement insurance despite the fact that he had a damaged disk in his back, the consequence of his sporting activities.

STD benefits are based on a percentage of the insured\u2019s salary: The benefit amount is 70%-75% of salary; Benefits are taxable income because the employer pays the premium; Benefit is higher than LTD benefits. The benefit period begins: Seven days after disability caused by illness; The day that disability is caused by an accident. The own occupation definition of disability applies. Therefore, the benefit is paid if the disability of the life insured prevents him from working at his regular occupation.

A couple of months ago Myron injured himself when a golf cart that he was riding on during a weekend tournament tipped over and badly damaged his leg.

If Myron is still disabled after 12 months, his coverage will change from short-term disability to long-term disability. EI is often a second payor of disability coverage. The following way of staggering EI and STD benefits ensures that this dollar-for-dollar reduction of EI benefits is avoided: EI insurance has a maximum 15-week benefit period after a waiting period of one week ; When disability begins, the insured receives the STD benefit first-day benefit for one week \u2013 the waiting period of EI; When the EI benefit period initiates, the insured stops receiving STD benefits and begins receiving EI Benefits for a total of 15 weeks and then stops; The insured begins receiving the STD benefits at the beginning of week 17.","title":"2.3.2.1 Short-term disability (STD)"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_2_Insurance_to_Protect_Income/#2322-long-term-disability-ltd","text":"LTD begins when STD ends and the plan member is still disabled.

Creditor disability insurance is often provided as a package deal and is included with the loan itself. Benefits are received by the creditor tax-free.

Due to their medical condition, these individuals often need to acquire the financial means to make important changes in their lifestyle: Paying off debt (i.e., mortgages or credit card balances) to assist with the financial stress associated with a long recovery period, medical expenses and/or a reduced future earning ability; Alternative and conventional treatments not covered by provincial medical plans; Home renovations to accommodate changes in the individual\u2019s physical ability (i.e., installing a wheelchair ramp); Choice to work part-time or change employment altogether (i.e., due to reduced physical capacity); Vacations to deal with and reduce medical stress. Without CI benefits, the incurred expense of making these essential lifestyle changes could potentially greatly diminish one\u2019s assets. Furthermore, more individuals survive life-threatening conditions due to advancements in general medical care and, specifically, emergency medical treatment. For example: 1 out of every 2 Canadians who suffer a heart attack is younger than 65 years \u201495% survive their first attack; 1 out of 3 Canadians will develop cancer \u201465% of them will survive for a minimum of 5 years; 1 out of 20 Canadians who suffer a stroke are younger than age 70 and 75% of those will survive; Between 3% and 5% of critical illness claims are made by Canadians who had coronary bypass surgery. CI provides individuals within this group with the financial means to cover the additional health-related costs incurred and protect their assets. In other words, an individual insured with CI does not need to worry about depleting investments and savings to pay for health-related expenses and lifestyle changes. 3.1.1 Coverage provided \u00b6 The tax-free payment of a CI policy is received by the insured when he suffers from a medical condition covered by the CI contract. 3.1.1.1 Minimum/maximum issue ages \u00b6 Typically, a policy may be issued to those between 18 and 65 years of age. Insurers typically do not accept individuals over the age of 65 due to the high risk they pose. More limited policies are available for children\u2014these plans offer significantly lower benefits. 3.1.1.2 Minimum/maximum face amount \u00b6 Minimum coverage is $10,000; maximum is $2 million. Typical policy face amounts are \\(50,000\u2013\\) 500,000 and differ by insurers. The amount of coverage issued will be based on an applicant\u2019s: Age, gender, smoking status; Medical history and current health; Medical history of parents and siblings; Financial status relative to the amount of insurance (i.e., to avoid over-insurance). 3.1.1.3 Qualification period \u00b6 There is a 30-day qualification period following the issue of the policy during which the benefit cannot be claimed. Exclusionary Period: The period between the issue date of the policy and the onset or diagnosis of a condition listed in the policy, before that condition would be covered for purpose of a claim. This period may vary in time or application from carrier to carrier. The purpose of the exclusionary period is to protect the insurer against anti-selection: applicants seeking coverage because they fear that they may have a covered condition. It is important to understand the differences between CI policies and life insurance\u2014CI benefits are contingent on the insured contracting a covered medical condition and surviving, opposed to life insurance benefits which depend upon the insured dying. 3.1.1.4 Survival (waiting) period \u00b6 Waiting Period: The period between the date that a covered condition is diagnosed and benefit becomes payable, such that the insurer can have a reasonable expectation the insured will, in fact, survive the condition. The waiting period is often 30 days, but may be longer in relation to certain conditions. 3.1.1.5 Duration of coverage \u00b6 CI is issued with both term and permanent forms of coverage. Term policies are issued for a period of years, such as 10 years or 20 years, or to a specific age, such as age 65. The 10-year and 20-year contracts are often guaranteed renewable to age 75 with an increase in premium. They may be convertible up to age 65 to permanent coverage without medical evidence but the insured may not be on a claim at the time of conversion. A permanent policy ends at age 100. All policies are terminated by a claim unless a rider covers a \u201csecond event\u201d as described in Section 3.1.5. 3.1.2 Types of policies \u00b6 Policies are issued based on the number of conditions they cover. Base policies cover three to four major health conditions: Three-health condition policies cover heart attack, stroke and cancer; Four-health condition policies cover the above plus coronary bypass surgery; Extended policies cover ten to twenty health conditions including the above conditions (outlined below under conditions covered). CI policies for children cover conditions specific to the young such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, type 1 diabetes and cerebral palsy. A child policy may be convertible to adult coverage when the child reaches the conversion age set in the policy, such as age 18 or 25. CI insurance is also offered: By financial institutions for coverage of a mortgage; Issued with minimal underwriting\u2014potential underwriting when claim occurs; In place to discharge the remaining mortgage balance if the mortgage payor suffers a critical illness. Benefits paid directly to the financial institution; As a rider on a life policy; Limited benefits. Through certain stand-alone mortgage life and disability policies also contain a clause for payout of a benefit in the event that the insured should suffer a critical illness; and Through guaranteed issue contracts: Without underwriting; A declaration of good health is required; More expensive than coverage that is underwritten; Limited benefits to less than $100,000. 3.1.3 Conditions covered \u00b6 Policies vary in their coverage by insurer. Some conditions are excluded from coverage, such as non-occupational HIV/AIDS. Definitions of covered medical conditions may vary from between plans. Often the definition of covered condition may vary from plan to plan. For example, the degree of heart muscle damage may determine if the insured\u2019s heart attack was severe enough to be covered under the contract\u2019s definition of a heart attack. 3.1.3.1 \u201cBig 4\u201d - heart attack, stroke, cancer, and coronary bypass surgery \u00b6 Most basic CI policies provide coverage for what is called the \u201cbig 4\u201d: Heart attack; Stroke; Cancer; Coronary bypass surgery. 3.1.3.2 Expanded coverage \u00b6 The list of conditions covered may be expanded to more comprehensive policies which cover 10 or 20 conditions, depending on the insurance company. List of conditions covered and which riders can be added differs between CI carriers The more conditions covered, the higher the premium\u2014the insurer takes on a greater risk of paying a benefit. Definitions differ between policies. The following table is an example of the potential coverage offered: The more conditions that a policy covers, and the easier it is to meet the definitions of those conditions, the more at risk the insurer is of having to pay a claim. And hence, the higher the policy premiums will be. The exact definition of these conditions may vary from policy to policy. Most conditions must be severe enough to be life-threatening before benefits would be payable. 3.1.4 Riders available \u00b6 The two most common CI policy riders are the following: The return of premium rider (also referred to as the refund of premium rider); Waiver of premium rider. 3.1.4.1 Return of premium (ROP) \u00b6 The return of premium rider added to the CI policy refunds all or some of the premiums paid by the policyholder upon death or expiration of the policy provided there has never been a claim: The following returns of premiums can be offered: On death: A total or partial refund is paid to the policyholder\u2019s estate/named beneficiary if the insured dies from a condition not covered by the policy or dies during the qualification and survival period. On surrender: A total or partial refund is paid if the policyholder cancels the policy after a specified number of years without a claim. On maturity: A total or partial refund is paid if the policy matures at the end of its terms, i.e., at the end of its term, without a claim. 3.1.4.2 Waiver of premium \u00b6 The waiver of premium rider added to the CI policy comes into effect if the insured becomes disabled\u2014the waiver of premium rider waives all premiums for the period of disability. The qualifying disability for a waiver of premium is different than the qualifying disability under the CI policy (i.e., a claim that would result in CI benefits). For example, a minor stroke that is temporarily debilitating would trigger the waiver of premium whereas a severe stroke that causes long-term damage would trigger the CI benefits. The rider is added when the policy is issued. To qualify for the rider, the insured must: Meet certain medical qualifications; Pay additional premiums for the rider; Be under the age of 55. A waiting period of four to six months is in place after the beginning of the qualifying disability. The premiums paid by the insured during this time may be refunded to him upon expiration of the waiting period. The waiver continues until: Disability ends; A successful claim is made for the CI benefit; or The policy expires. 3.1.5 Payment of benefits \u00b6 Benefits are paid when: The diagnosis and beginning of the condition must occur a minimum of 30 days after the policy\u2019s issue date (i.e., after the qualification period); The life insured must survive the diagnosis and be alive at least 30 days after diagnosis (or more as specified in the policy); The insured dies after the waiting period but before the claim is paid, the benefits would be payable to their estate/beneficiary; The life insured has to typically file a claim within 30 days of his qualifying condition\u2019s diagnosis; Medical proof has been provided within 90 days of the claim\u2014the life insurance medical advisors must also approve the claim in terms of the CI policy requirements. Although the lump sum form of payment is most common, some policies provide instalment payments. The benefit payout is a one-time payout. After a successful claim, the policy is cancelled. Example Sylvia successfully claimed a $100,000 benefit under her CI insurance policy in 2011, due to the diagnosis of a qualifying cancer. When she subsequently had a heart attack in 2013, she was unable to make a second claim under her policy because the contract had been terminated upon payout of the 2011 cancer claim. The exception to this is when there is a second event rider that will continue to provide a lesser amount of benefits after claim one upon a future unrelated claim. For example, if the insured has a second event rider and files a first claim due to a heart attack, his second claim related to life-threatening cancer will issue a second, lesser benefit payment. There are standard exclusions to the payment of the benefit. They include a medical condition arising from: War; Terrorism; Attempted suicide; Self-inflicted injuries; Normal pregnancy; Criminal activities; Drug abuse; Non-occupational AIDS/HIV. 3.1.5.1 Tax treatment of critical illness premiums, benefits and return of premium benefit \u00b6 Premiums paid are not tax deductible. Premiums paid do not qualify for the Medical Expense Tax Credit. Benefits received from a claim or return of premium are tax-free. 3.2 Long-Term Care \u00b6 More Canadians are living longer and some will need care for longer periods of time. Long-term care is much more than nursing home care; home care, assisted-living facilities and nursing home care are all examples of long-term care. Anybody who cannot take care of their physical needs on an independent basis may qualify for long-term care. A young person suffering from multiple sclerosis, an individual suffering from a brain or spinal cord injury that has left them with severe physical and mental problems as well as an individual with Alzheimer\u2019s are all examples of individuals who qualify for long-term care. This chapter looks at the insured\u2019s need for long-term care, the types of care available and the insurance coverage in place to assist with long-term-care expenses. 3.2.1 Canadian demographics \u00b6 The majority of long-term care users are over the age of 65 in Canada. This demographic will greatly expand over the next 20 to 30 years as the baby-boomers age. Diagram 3.1 Age pyramid of the population, Canada, 1961, 2011 and 2061 Diagram 3.1 demonstrates the following: The age and gender structure of Canada\u2019s population have changed and will continue to change significantly between 1961 and 2061; More than 50 years later, the bulge has moved up the pyramid as baby boomers, aged 46 to 65 in 2011, have grown older. The proportion of seniors has been steadily increasing for the past 50 years due to a lengthening of life expectancy. This increase will accelerate in the coming years as more baby boomers reach 65 years of age. The narrower base demonstates a drop in fertility. As the baby-boom cohorts grow older and Canada\u2019s population continues to age, the structure of the population can be expected to increasingly resemble a rectangle, as shown by the pyramid for 2061 based on the medium-growth scenario of the most recent population projections. According to the medium-growth scenario of the most recent population projections, the proportion of seniors could start to exceed the proportion of children in 2017, with a subsequent widening of the gap. The proportion of the population that is of working age (15 to 64 years of age) has remained at around 68% since the 1980s due to the presence of the baby boomers in this age group. In the next 50 years, as baby boomers exit this age group, this proportion could drop down to the levels recorded in the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s, that is, to approximately 60% of the population. LTC could potentially be part of the solution to pay for the future funding of long-term care. 3.2.2 Long-term care options \u00b6 Long-term care is available in public and private facilities. Expense ranges from lower-cost (publicly provided) options to very expensive, well-equipped private facilities. The most common private/public services available are: Home care; Respite care; Assisted living; Nursing home (facility) care. 3.2.2.1 Home care \u00b6 Care provided at home is the first step in the process of long-term care. Often the first choice for many seniors. It is ideal to stay in the home environment for as long as possible. Home care provides quality of life. Home care can be provided by a health care worker, community service work or caregiver. Home care is most often provided by a primary informal caregiver such as a family member when the patient\u2019s need is minimal. Home care services are generally charged at an hourly rate and may or may not be necessary on a daily basis and are likely to be a temporary need. Home care is provided as: Nursing; Daytime companionship and overnight stays; Help with meals or housekeeping; and Personal care for bathing and other activities of daily living. 3.2.2.2 Respite care \u00b6 An individual who requires full-time care at home can become a burden both physically and emotionally over time to his at-home caregivers who is normally a member of the patient\u2019s family (spouse, child, grandchild, etc.). Respite care provides relief by giving the caregiver a break. The caregiver is provided with relief through either: Informal assistance for a short period of time from friends, family and community services; or Formal assistance adult day care or a nursing home stay; the caregiver is temporarily released from caregiving responsibilities (i.e., for an overnight stay or longer). Generally, informal assistance is free whereas formal assistance comes at a cost (i.e., the cost of adult day care, transportation, etc.). Example Rudi, age 62, looks after his 86-year-old mother, who has Parkinson\u2019s disease, on an essentially full-time basis. She lives with Rudi and he has to assist her with many day-to-day activities and keep a watchful eye on her to prevent her from accidentally injuring herself. Although Rudi has nurses and care workers coming to his home to offer his mother regular therapy and assistance, the situation is still very wearing on him. Respite care would provide for Rudi\u2019s mother to spend a few days each quarter in a temporary stay at a nursing home facility, to give Rudi a much-needed break from the stresses of the day-to-day care routine. 3.2.2.3 Assisted living \u00b6 Assisted living facilities, often referred to as seniors\u2019 residences, are provided to those who can no longer function in an independent living situation or in their homes but do not require 24-hour medical care or supervision. The middle degree of care between home care and nursing home care. Part-time nursing support may be available in addition to assistance with daily activities, such as shopping or cleaning. 3.2.2.4 Nursing home (facility) care \u00b6 Nursing home care is a preferred solution for those who can no longer live independently and require continuous assistance and medical attention. Nursing homes have a doctor on site and provide 24-hour a day care such as assistance with daily living. Their in-house facilities typically offer assistance with the activities of daily living, fully prepared meals, and group and individual recreation activities for their more active members. Some nursing homes schedule field trips for their more active members. 3.2.3 Providers of long-term care \u00b6 Long-term care services are provided through: Government facilities; Religious organizations; Not-for-profit organizations; and For-profit corporations (i.e., private service providers, assisted living centres and nursing homes). 3.2.3.1 Publicly funded facilities \u00b6 Provincial governments regulate and fund public nursing homes and subsidize rates for low-income patients who are unable to afford the full monthly fees. Care is subsidized by the provincial health care plan based on a means test provided to low-income individuals. 3.2.3.2 Publicly funded home care \u00b6 Home care costs may be funded by the government through: A contracted agency; A subsidy to an individual who has selected his own home caregiver through a home care agency. For additional information regarding home care funding refer to, Evidence and Perspective on Funding Healthcare in Canada, at: http://healthcarefunding.ca/home-care/ . 3.2.4 Cost of long-term care \u00b6 It is typically expensive to stay in a nursing home and the cost depends on a number of factors: Whether the patient has a shared or private room; Whether the facility is public or private; Private nursing homes are significantly more expensive than public; Where the patient lives: costs are higher in some provinces than others; The insurer takes on additional risk based on the amount of coverage the province covers. Whether the care is basic or extensive. A patient may live for many years in a nursing home. The cost range between $900 and $5,000 per month or more and can become substantial over time depleting the insured\u2019s estate. It is important to remember that some private nursing homes offer additional services and may charge much more than the norm. In most provinces, provincial subsidies are means-based\u2014higher-income individuals receive a much lower subsidy and pay for more costs independently. In these cases, there is a large gap between what the province covers and the actual cost of care the patient must pay. LTC insurance is in place to: Relieve the insured\u2019s financial burden of long-term care; and Pay for the long-term care facilities the insured needs rather than just what they can afford out of pocket. Table 3.1 is a representative example of average monthly costs of a full-time resident in a nursing home among the different Canadian provinces. 3.3 Individual Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance \u00b6 A long-term care insurance policy provides a maximum daily benefit to the insured who is no longer able to function independently due to illness, injury or aging. This benefit covers the insured\u2019s expenses related to professional health care services. The insurance is available as: A stand-alone policy (most common); A rider on a life insurance policy; A rider on a critical illness insurance policy. LTC Riders are: Added at the time of the base contract\u2019s application; Subject to underwriting (both medical and financial); Subject to its own additional premium. Long-term-care benefits are paid directly to: The patient to reimburse expenses already paid (reimbursement model); The service provider such as a nursing home (indemnity model). 3.3.1 Purpose/Who Needs It \u00b6 As life spans lengthen and government financial resources become ever more strapped, it is suggested that all Canadians need to acquire long-term care insurance to be able to personally fund the need for care in their older years. For example, in 2011, almost 5 million Canadians were over 65 years of age. 7% of individuals over 65 and 30% of individuals over 85 lived in care facilities; For additional information refer to, 2011 Census of Population: Families, households, marital status, structural type of dwelling, collectives, at: http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/120919/dq120919a-eng.htm . Individual LTC insurance is available as an additional rider to life insurance policies or on a stand-alone basis. Insurance is best acquired between 45 and 55 when premiums are lower. Coverage is typically not available after age 65. 3.3.2 Advantages \u00b6 The primary advantage of long-term care insurance is the funding it provides to the insured in order to receive the desired type of care without worrying about the expense of long-term care services - whether that means a longer period of independent living with home care or the luxury of a top-notch nursing home. LTC also retains estate value by paying the expenses of care \u2013 without LTC insurance, the insured would most often experience depletion in their estate value when paying for care services. Therefore, LTC insurance typically results in a better quality of life due to the better quality of services he receives through the LTC insurance without the added financial stress of either paying for these services out of pocket or depending on the government for care in retirement. 3.3.3 Coverage provided \u00b6 LTC policies provide coverage for insureds who, due to old age, injury or illness are in need of in-home care, assisted living facilities and respite benefits as an alternative or in addition to care facilities. LTC policies cover many of the expenses not covered at all or not fully covered by provincial health plans. An applicant is subject to medical underwriting based on: Age, gender, and smoking status; Medical history; Current health and cognitive ability; Ability to perform six activities of daily living. See Section 3.3.3.1 A policy provides a maximum daily benefit and a total number of days the benefit will be paid, to an overall maximum. The daily limit may not be exceeded. However, if less than the maximum is spent in any one day, it can be used to add more days to the total number of days of coverage. There is an elimination period of up to 90 days\u2014based on the amount of days of care the insured can afford to fund independently. The longer the elimination period, the lower the premium. Standard exclusions apply for illness, injury, or an impairment arising from war, terrorism, attempted suicide, etc. See the full list in Section 3.1.5. Example Gregory has an LTC insurance policy with a rider that offers him up to one year (365 days) of home care coverage at a maximum of $200 a day. His overall maximum benefit for home care would be $73,000 ( $200 \u00d7 365 days). If some of his care days required less than $200 of benefits, the term of the benefits payable could be extended beyond 365 days until the entire $73,000 of benefits had been paid out. 3.3.3.1 Activities of daily living (ADLs) \u00b6 The ability to perform the activities of daily living (ADLs) is fundamental to a long-term-care policy. Activities of daily living (ADLs) are a measure of physical ability. To receive a benefit, the insured must not be able to independently perform any two or more of the following ADLs: Dressing\u2014The ability to dress oneself; Bathing\u2014The ability to wash oneself; Toileting\u2014The ability to get on and off (and to and from) the toilet; Transferring\u2014The ability to move from one location to another without the use of a supporting device (i.e., from a chair to a bed without the relying on crutches); Eating\u2014The ability to feed oneself; Maintaining continence\u2014The ability to maintain control of one\u2019s bowels and bladders. Cognitive ability is another test applied to determine whether the insured qualifies for benefits: Cognitive abilities relate to the mental processes of perception, memory, judgment, and reasoning; Its absence is called cognitive impairment; Cognitive impairment can be created by an underlying physical condition, such as a stroke, or mental condition, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. A physician attests to ADLs and cognitive impairment. This physician is often chosen by the insurance company. 3.3.4 Long-term care riders available \u00b6 Although there will, of course, be exceptions in the marketplace, the following are the most common riders available under long-term care contracts: Cost of living adjustment (COLA); Return of premium. 3.3.4.1 Cost of living adjustment (COLA) \u00b6 By the very nature of the insurance provided, the benefits from an LTC policy could be paid for many years. Due to inflation, the maximum daily benefit could potentially not cover the rising costs of care over time. The COLA rider will ensure purchasing power is not eroded over time by automatically increasing the maximum benefit by 2%-3% per year. This ensures that the benefits stay in line with the rising costs of care. 3.3.4.2 Return of premium (ROP) \u00b6 A premium refund is possible if this rider has been purchased, and the insured dies before a claim is made. The refunded amount varies between policies with a maximum of 50% of premiums paid for a 10-year duration or 100% for a 20-year period. The rider adds 25% to 50% to the basic policy premium. Benefits are tax-free. Example Antonia paid $1,800 a year for her LTC insurance policy, including a $400 extra annual premium for a return of premium rider providing for a 25% refund of total premiums paid over an 8-year claim-free period. She died this year after having paid into the policy and been claims-free for 10 years. Upon her death, her estate received a $4,500 (25% \u00d7 $1,800 \u00d7 10) return of premium benefit from the insurance company. 3.3.5 Policy benefits \u00b6 The long-term care insurance policy daily benefit may be paid to: The patient for reimbursement of personal expenses; The service provider, such as a nursing home (referred to as an indemnity benefit). Benefits are subject to an overall limit defined in the contract. Typically, home care benefits are reimbursed to the insured whereas nursing home care benefits are paid to the nursing home. The insured must provide the insurer with receipts in order to be reimbursed. The insured is reimbursed only for the amount spent on care (not the total maximum daily amount). Maximum overall benefit is calculated by the number of days of coverage at the maximum daily rate. Benefits begin when the attending physician certifies the need for services and the services begin. Example Kashif, age 71, suffered a stroke 18 months ago that resulted in limited mobility. Consequently, he was restricted to his home most of the time and had to have nurses, a physiotherapist and a housekeeper attend him regularly. Kashif paid for these services himself and then claimed a reimbursement from the home care clause under his LTC insurance policy. Unfortunately, Kashif suffered a second stroke 3 months ago and is now confined to a nursing care home full-time. Costs not covered by the provincial health care plan are now paid directly to the nursing home under the indemnity benefit provided by Kashif\u2019s policy. 3.3.5.1 Tax treatment of long-term care benefits \u00b6 All benefits paid out under a long-term care policy are tax-free to the insured, whether those benefits are paid directly to the caregiver/care facility involved in providing care or to the insured by way of reimbursement for services previously paid personally. 3.3.6 Premiums \u00b6 Premium payments may be required for: The total duration of the contract (with the exception for when the policyholder is on claim and receiving benefits) or; A fixed term option for premiums, such as 20 years. This typically will allow the insured to pay for his policy before retiring. Typically, policies are guaranteed renewable and thus renewed annually. However, the majority of policies have a provision that states that premiums may be raised at renewal by the insurer\u2019s discretion on a class basis. There is a 30-day grace period following the premium due date that keeps the policy in force if the premium is not paid on time. The policy lapses when the grace period ends and the premium has not been paid. The premium payable amount is contingent on the following factors: Amount of coverage; Number of days benefits are payable; Type of coverage; Elimination period; The insured\u2019s underwriting characteristics; Requirements to qualify for benefits. 3.3.6.1 Tax treatment of long-term care premiums \u00b6 Premiums are not tax deductible. They may qualify as eligible expenses for purposes of claiming the federal Medical Expense Tax Credit. 3.4 Coordinating Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance With Other Types of Accident and Sickness Insurance \u00b6 Disability income insurance, critical illness insurance, and long-term care insurance possess distinct as well as similar characteristics. Each form of insurance fills very separate roles as a result of the characteristics outlined in Table 3.2. 3.4.1 Long-term care (LTC) insurance and disability insurance \u00b6 There is no duplication of benefits between these two policies because: DI policies replace lost income in the event of disability. They do not cover the additional costs incurred due to disability. LTC policies cover incurred health care costs and related expenses. They do not replace the insured\u2019s income. However, up to a certain age of the insured, some insurers allow DI policies to be converted to LTC policies. 3.4.2 Long-term care (LTC) insurance and critical illness (CI) insurance \u00b6 Benefits could be duplicated with an insured receiving the benefit of each. This duplication is almost unavoidable because: CI policies provide the insured with the financial means to adapt to the costs of life changes from an outlined cause (i.e., a heart attack); Based on the consequences of his condition, the insured may or may not qualify for all the services in the LTC policy (i.e., a nursing home). Even so, the cash would be provided by the critical illness plan. Therefore, it is difficult to build in offsets between CI and LTC policies. 3.5 Limitations of Critical Illness (CI) Insurance and Long-Term Care (LTC) In-surance \u00b6 Insurance coverage does not always guarantee that the insured\u2019s total medical and care needs will be covered in the event of an accident. Gaps do exist between the insured\u2019s need, the policy\u2019s coverage as well as the benefits available. All contracts should be read carefully before finalizing an application. Particular attention should be paid to the following. The importance of contract wording It is very important to examine the contract closely and never make an assumption that the insured\u2019s coverage needs will be met. For example, the benefits start date will be worded in the contract \u2013 benefits will only be payable to the insured after this date. The importance of definitions Coverage definitions are a major factor in determining if an individual qualifies for benefits. The insured will not receive his benefits unless his condition matches the exact definition outlined in the contract. For example, a degree of cognitive impairment will be defined in the contract in order to qualify for benefits. Over time, the insurer\u2019s definitions of benefits change. Therefore, based on when the contract was issued, the same insurer may vary their definition of a given condition. Differing medical opinions from the insurance company\u2019s and the policyholder\u2019s medical advisors The insurer\u2019s medical specialists set out the criteria for coverage and if the insured qualifies for benefits even if other doctors outside of the insurance company state that the insured qualifies for benefits.","title":"Chapter 3 Insurance to Protect Assets"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_3_Insurance_to_Protect_Assets/#chapter-3-insurance-to-protect-assets","text":"","title":"Chapter 3: Insurance to Protect Assets"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_3_Insurance_to_Protect_Assets/#31-critical-illness-ci-insurance","text":"Severe illness has a great impact on an individual\u2019s life and is certain\u2014even if the injured is able to return back to work\u2014to cause additional health-related costs or changes in lifestyle not covered by traditional disability insurance. Due to their medical condition, these individuals often need to acquire the financial means to make important changes in their lifestyle: Paying off debt (i.e., mortgages or credit card balances) to assist with the financial stress associated with a long recovery period, medical expenses and/or a reduced future earning ability; Alternative and conventional treatments not covered by provincial medical plans; Home renovations to accommodate changes in the individual\u2019s physical ability (i.e., installing a wheelchair ramp); Choice to work part-time or change employment altogether (i.e., due to reduced physical capacity); Vacations to deal with and reduce medical stress. Without CI benefits, the incurred expense of making these essential lifestyle changes could potentially greatly diminish one\u2019s assets. Furthermore, more individuals survive life-threatening conditions due to advancements in general medical care and, specifically, emergency medical treatment. For example: 1 out of every 2 Canadians who suffer a heart attack is younger than 65 years \u201495% survive their first attack; 1 out of 3 Canadians will develop cancer \u201465% of them will survive for a minimum of 5 years; 1 out of 20 Canadians who suffer a stroke are younger than age 70 and 75% of those will survive; Between 3% and 5% of critical illness claims are made by Canadians who had coronary bypass surgery.

As the baby-boom cohorts grow older and Canada\u2019s population continues to age, the structure of the population can be expected to increasingly resemble a rectangle, as shown by the pyramid for 2061 based on the medium-growth scenario of the most recent population projections.

Some expenses are continual - such as a recurring prescription. Others arise suddenly as a result of an accident or illness. All such costs can reduce cash flow available for savings or require an individual to dip into savings for payment or income needs. Extended health insurance reduces the risk of losing savings to health care expenses. A policy may be purchased directly from an agent - the policy owner is typically the person who makes claims and receives the policy benefits. Policies are available to: Individuals (as personal policies); and Members of group plans. Extended health insurance is also offered by financial institutions (i.e., banks, credit unions, etc.) to their credit customers with limited coverage. This coverage is not common enough to be discussed in this chapter. 4.1.1 Individual extended health insurance \u00b6 Each provincial government provides health insurance to its residents. Provincial health care coverage includes many forms of medical care and treatment at home and within Canada. It also provides a reimbursement for a portion of medical expenses incurred outside Canada. An individual extended health insurance policy supplements the coverage provided by the provincial plan or group health care plan. The policyholder buys the plan directly from the insurance agent. The policyholder chooses the plan benefits and limits that best suit their needs and circumstances. The policy can be cancelled at any time. 4.1.2 Group extended health coverage \u00b6 Group plans provide coverage to many Canadians for extended health services. The coverage is provided as a predetermined range of services, with set limits and some options (such as additional family coverage). Group plans cover a group of individuals who typically share an occupation, association or employment in common. The majority of individuals who have extended health insurance are insured under a group plan through their work. The policyholder is typically an employer; the group members are the employees. 4.2 Types of Extended Health Coverage to Protect Savings \u00b6 Typically, individual extended health coverage options reflect those offered with group plans: Medical care; Dental care; Travel insurance. Individual policies permit that the insured chooses one or more of these options to form a health plan in line with their personal needs. This is opposed to group policies which require that these options be compiled into a contract of predetermined benefits. Therefore, when choosing the individual extended health plan, both the types and level of coverage are left up to the individual in terms of their needs and finances. Full underwriting applies to policies except travel insurance. Travel policies apply underwriting when a claim is made. 4.2.1 Medical care \u00b6 Medical care coverage is provided to: Those who want to add coverage to their existing provincial health care insurance; New residents of Canada who have not yet qualified for their provincial health care insurance; and Members of group plans who want to add coverage on top of their group plan and their existing provincial health-care insurance. 4.2.1.1 Coverage provided \u00b6 Coverage for individuals is available for: Extended health care\u2014for example, hospital services not covered by provincial health care insurance such as a semi-private or private hospital room; Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D); Prescription drugs; Dental care; Vision care; Emergency travel medical. Again, the applicant can pick and choose what types and the amount of coverage to include in the contract in terms of their budget and needs. Some contractual restrictions put out by the insurance company do apply. 4.2.1.2 Deductibles and co-insurance \u00b6 Deductibles and co-insurance refer to provisions that require the insured to pay a portion of the covered medical expenses out of pocket. Their purpose is to reduce the premium cost by: Making the insured responsible for a portion of the qualifying costs; and Discouraging the insured from making unnecessary claims due to their responsibility for a portion of the qualifying cost. They may apply to all forms of coverage as well as both individual and group plans. A deductible refers to a dollar cost that the insured must pay in full of otherwise covered benefits before insurance claims will be paid by the insurance company. A deductible is charged annually and restarts anew every year. A deductible is most common in a group plan. Example Jose\u2019s extended health insurance plan has a $100 annual deductible for dental benefits: he must pay the first $100 of dental expenses annually himself, without reimbursement from his plan. Co-insurance refers to a cost expressed as a percentage that the insured pays on each claim. The insurance company pays the balance of the claim. Co-insurance limits the insured\u2019s coverage. Co-insurance is applied to every claim. 4.2.2 Dental care \u00b6 Dental care is not generally provided by provincial health plans. Therefore, dental care is often the backbone of the individual extended health coverage plan. Example Consuela has purchased an individual extended health policy that has an 80% co-insurance factor for dental claims. The plan pays for 80% of each claim and Consuela assumes responsibility for the other 20%. 4.2.2.1 Coverage provided \u00b6 Dental insurance coverage is categorized as routine maintenance and major restorative services. Routine maintenance is just as its name describes: routine dental services to maintain healthy teeth. It includes: Regular check-ups; Periodic X-rays; Cleaning; Fillings; Extractions. There is an annual maximum to what will be paid for routine services and often co-insurance that requires the insured to pay 20%-25% of costs. Major restorative services include crowns, bridges, dentures and other major dental procedures. A much higher co-insurance factor applies to major restorative services\u2014the insured may be required to pay as much as 50% of the cost. Claims for both categories are also limited to a fee schedule set provincially by each dental association. For example, if a provincial dental association has a schedule that specifies a filling costs $200, and an insured\u2019s claim for a filling is $250, the insured will need to pay the $50 in excess ( $250 - $200 = $50). For extensive dental care (i.e., in the $500 or more range), insurers generally require that the insured have the dentist submit an estimate before the dental work takes place in order to predetermine coverage cost. Example Igor\u2019s dentist charges $300 for a basic tooth extraction. The provincial dental schedule sets the price of a standard extraction at a maximum of $225. Igor will have to pay the difference of $75 himself since his dental coverage is restricted to the amount specified in the schedule. The policy\u2019s co-insurance factor will further increase the amount he must pay. 4.2.2.2 Deductibles and co-insurance \u00b6 Deductibles and co-insurance are also applied to dental insurance claims to regulate premiums for extended health coverage. Dental insurance uses the most amounts of deductibles and co-insurance services. This is because medical services are generally partially or fully paid by the provincial health-care plans, whereas dental plans typically are not. This leaves the cost of the dental expenses up to the individual and insurance company to cover. 4.2.3 Travel insurance \u00b6 Travel insurance is a broad term that encompasses both emergency medical care needed when travelling and may cover some or all of the following: Emergency medical expenses; Costs for lost or damaged luggage; Trip cancellation; Return home of an ill or injured traveller. Medical expenses incurred abroad may be reimbursed by the provincial health care plan of the patient according to the schedule set by the provincial health-care plan. Because provincial health coverage varies among the different provinces, an expense may be covered in one province but not another. The patient must be prepared to pay costs charged outside Canada personally and then file receipts with their provincial plan on their return. For example, if the AHCIP (Alberta health care plan) schedule is set at $175 for a visit to the office of a specialist in the U.S., and the cost paid by the patient is $375, the patient pays $375 and gets $175 from AHCIP. The uninsured patient is out of pocket $200. Travel insurance is particularly critical when travelling with the cost of hospitalization being generally higher abroad than it is in Canada and can be draining to an individual\u2019s savings and cash flow if that individual is not insured. Travel insurance coverage is offered by travel agents, and directly from insurers, financial institutions, airlines and online providers. The insured must understand what is covered under their travel insurance policy, as different policies offer a wide range of services as well as levels of coverage. Some jurisdictions do not require an insurance license to sell travel insurance. Medical underwriting is done when the claim is made\u2014not at the issuance of the policy. 4.2.3.1 Coverage provided by an insurer \u00b6 Travel insurance can cover virtually all conceivable medical charges arising from an accident or illness. It does not cover elective procedures, such as cosmetic surgery. Coverage\u2019s available include, among others: Doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 fees; Hospitalization costs; Medical equipment; Ambulance services; Dental costs for accidental injury; Return of the injured traveller to their province of residence; Return of a deceased traveller\u2019s remains to their province of residence; Return of the insured\u2019s vehicle to their province of residence; Lost baggage insurance; Trip interruption or cancellation due to illness. The insurer often provides the insured with a contact card with the name and number of a provider to be contacted when an emergency occurs. The contact can assist the insured by ordering an ambulance for them as well as directing them to the nearest place where they can seek medical assistance (i.e., a hospital, clinic, etc.). 4.2.3.2 Coverage provided through a credit card \u00b6 Credit cards often provide travel medical coverage as an option or standard coverage that comes automatically with the card. Coverage from a credit card is typically not as comprehensive as coverage with an insurance policy. Coverage can differ greatly based on the provider and card type. Some require their card to be used to book the trip before providing medical coverage. For example, if Sally uses her MasterCard to book her trip, her VISA card medical coverage may not apply. There is no medical evidence of insurability required. When a claim is made, the insurer determines if the claim is covered under the terms of the coverage. However, a claim may be denied if it is discovered to be a pre-existing condition. Therefore, the insured is never completely sure if a claim will be honoured under the travel insurance provided through a credit card. 4.2.3.3 Pre-existing conditions \u00b6 A pre-existing condition is a medical condition experienced by the insured up to 180 days before departure. It includes: A visit to a doctor for specific symptoms needing treatment; Medical tests or a prescription for medical tests; Medical treatment for a condition or a prescription for medical treatment; A change to a prescription (this includes stopping the prescription, or decreasing dosage or frequency). In some cases, insureds failing to disclose to the insurer that they take a daily preventative baby aspirin against stroke or heart attack could lead to a denial of the claim since this is viewed as not disclosing a pre-existing condition related to medication. Chronic conditions are health conditions that are long-lasting or recur frequently (ex. diabetes). Chronic conditions that were diagnosed prior to the 90-or 180-day period may result in restricted coverage if the individual has not had to see a doctor for the condition or experienced any symptoms for up to one year before the trip. (ex. the insured may be required to demonstrate that he has been symptom-free of diabetes for atleast one year to qualify for full coverage). A pre-existing condition does not void all coverage\u2014however, the condition must be revealed and the underwriter decides whether to manage the risk by exclusion or a higher premium. Example Antonio, a resident of Qu\u00e9bec, scheduled a 30-day trip to his native Italy. Before his departure, he took out travel insurance through his local credit union. Antonio has been taking medication for epilepsy for the past 12 years, medication that does not always fully control his symptoms. If Antonio were to require treatment due to an epileptic seizure while in Italy, his treatment expenses would not be covered. On the other hand, if Antonio was injured in an automobile accident while travelling from the Rome airport, due to the carelessness of his taxi driver, his resulting medical expenses would be covered by his travel insurance policy. 4.2.3.4 Benefits \u00b6 The benefit is usually received as a reimbursement of expenses. The insured pays for the medical expenses when they occur and then submit a claim to the insurer with accompanying receipts. This reimbursement system allows the insurer to pay for their health care expenses as well as the provincial health plan to pay for their portion. To qualify for a benefit, the insured must immediately contact the name and number provided on the insurance card they were given when they bought the policy. There are standard exclusions for the benefit, such as attempted suicide, war, self-inflicted injuries, normal pregnancy, and drug or alcohol abuse. Certain exclusions are specific to travel insurance and are not common to other types of insurance: A hazardous activity (i.e., parasailing, scuba diving, etc.); Travel to countries which are on the travel advisory list published by Global Affairs Canada; When treatment is obtained for a non-emergency. 4.2.3.5 Factors affecting premiums \u00b6 The amount of coverage and length of the trip are the main factors in determining the premium. Premiums are based on: Amount of coverage; Often determined as the dollar cost of the trip, or range of services requested; For example, a policy with trip-cancellation insurance will cost more than a policy without. Length of the trip; However, the premium is generally not proportionally higher because of the general processing fees of all policies. For example, a 50-day policy will not be 5 times the price of a 10-day policy. Risks covered\u2014the higher the risk, the higher premium; Destination; Other provinces in Canada pose the least risk\u2014a low premium is paid due to similar medical costs across the provinces; U.S. and other countries outside of Canada pose a higher risk\u2014a higher premium is paid due to higher medical costs; Other countries outside of Canada considered high-risk zones (i.e., some countries in the Middle East and Latin America)\u2014a much higher premium is paid. Countries outside of Canada considered too high-risk\u2014the insurer will not issue coverage. Age of traveller; Individuals over 65 years pay higher premiums because they are more liable to injury or illness. Medical history of the traveller. 4.2.4 Taxation of individual extended health insurance premiums and benefits \u00b6 Individual extended health coverage premiums paid are not tax deductible. The premiums may be eligible for the medical expense tax credit. Benefits are received tax-free. 4.3 Group Extended Health Coverage \u00b6 Group extended health insurance covers a wide range of medical services that the provincial health care plans do not cover fully or at all. A group health plan is controlled by its sponsor\u2014usually an employer. The details of the plan are in the master contract issued to the sponsor. Coverage ends if the plan member departs from the group. A unique advantage of the group plan is that there is no underwriting for group members or their family members under the plan\u2014consequently pre-existing conditions are covered. Premiums can be shared between the plan member and employer. Deductibles and co-insurance clauses typically apply to benefits. 4.3.1 Types of coverage \u00b6 Like individual plans, group plans provide coverage for: Prescription drugs; Enhanced medical and hospital care; Dental care; Vision care; Accidental death and dismemberment. 4.3.1.1 Prescription drugs \u00b6 A prescription drug plan is an important part of an extended group policy since so many people use prescription drugs in their lives on a periodic or daily basis to treat illness. Medication is either sold as: Prescription drugs \u2013 can only be obtained with a prescription; Non-prescription drugs (over-the-counter drugs) \u2013 can be obtained at any store that sells over-the-counter drugs. Only prescription drugs are covered by group plans. Prescription drugs are often available in both: Brand-name; and A brand-name drug is manufactured by the pharmaceutical corporation that researched and developed it. A patent protects the company\u2019s investment. Other manufacturers will be free to make and sell their own version of the same drug, the generic version, once the brand-name drug patent runs out. Generic form. The generic drug has the same properties as the brand-name drug but is typically much cheaper. An insured who insists on the brand-name version will usually need to pay the difference between the price of the generic and the brand name options. A group plan will list: The list of drugs it will cover called a formulary; The price it will pay for the covered drugs. 4.3.1.2 Enhanced medical and hospital care \u00b6 As discussed, provincial health plans do not fully cover all the health care expenses an individual may incur. Group enhanced medical benefit (also referred to as the enhanced health care benefit) plans supplement services not fully covered or not covered at all by provincial health-care plans. These may include: Practitioners such as chiropractors, massage therapists, naturopaths, and optometrists; Medical expenses to a maximum annual limit, such as ambulance cost; Medical devices, such as crutches; and Upgrades to a semi-private or private hospital stays to a maximum daily limit and a maximum duration. There may be a co-insurance contribution required by the plan member for enhanced care costs, but there is usually no deductible. Example As a resident of Ontario, Jonah is entitled to a ward bed in a hospital, paid for entirely by the provincial health plan, if he is ill or injured and requires hospital treatment. His group plan will pay the difference if Jonah wishes to upgrade to a semi-private room. If Jonah wants a private room, he will have to pay the difference in cost between semi-private and private accommodation himself. 4.3.1.3 Dental care \u00b6 The cost of providing dental insurance to groups is more expensive than other forms of insurance because: Services are provided continually (i.e., twice-a-year check-ups); Dental care does not require a physical referral\u2014it is entirely discretionary; Provincial health care does not cover dental expenses (emergency medical dental care may be an exception)\u2014the insurer and individual must therefore cover the entire dental expense; Dental care is high cost in general; Family is often included in group dental plans; The plan\u2019s sponsor (i.e., employer) is typically responsible for the premiums for the coverage. Group dental plans reduce their costs through: Deductibles and co-insurance; Annual maximum coverage; Lifetime maximum coverage; Pre-approval of some costs (for example, pre-approval of semiannual teeth cleaning, periodic check-ups, X-rays and a maximum limit to orthodontic work); Excluding cosmetic work, such as whitening. 4.3.1.4 Vision care \u00b6 Vision care coverage is an important part of most group health plans. Group vision care reimburses expenses for visual impairment regarding: Prescription glasses and contact lenses; Optometrist fees (when not covered by the provincial health plan). Coverage is typically limited to between $100 and $350 every 2 years for glasses prescribed by an optometrist. Glasses will only be covered if they are prescribed by an optometrist. New glasses will only be issued in the stated time frame if the insured needs glasses for the first time or their prescription changes. Optometrist\u2019s fees are also sometimes covered by the insurer every 2 years to a maximum dollar amount, in provinces where these fees are not covered by provincial health plans. 4.3.1.5 Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) \u00b6 AD&D is a common part of most extended group and individual health plans. Like AD&D described elsewhere, coverage provides a benefit to the insured if dismemberment occurs (i.e., the loss of hearing, a limb etc.) and a benefit to the beneficiary if the insured dies as the result of an accident. Death of the insured: the benefit is paid as a fixed amount (referred to as the principal sum) and is payable to the beneficiary. Dismembering accident of the insured: the benefit is paid as a percentage of the insured amount calculated in regard to the severity of the dismemberment\u2014for example, the loss of use of an arm pays a benefit equal to 75% of the insured amount. In order for a claim to be paid, death must occur within 365 days of an accident; and dismemberment must be a direct result of the accident. Table 4.1 demonstrates the benefit payable due to accidental death or a dismembering accident. 4.3.2 Benefits \u00b6 The group plan benefit is paid as a reimbursement of costs or by direct billing. Benefits may not cover the entirety of all medical expenses: Some medical expenses are not included in the plan\u2014no benefit is payable for such expenses; Many medical expenses are subject to an annual maximum as well as co-payments\u2014benefits are payable to a certain defined amount. For example, the benefit plan may cover 12 visits to the chiropractor a year at a maximum of $100 per visit or a maximum benefit of $1,000 regardless of the number of visits. 4.3.2.1 Deductibles and co-insurance \u00b6 Co-payment is an integral part of most group plans in order to keep costs down. There are two types of co-payment plans by plan members: Annual deductibles; Co-insurance factors. The insurer will reimburse additional covered medical expenses only once the plan member pays the annual deductible. Example 1 Clarissa is a member of a group plan that has an annual $100 deductible on dental benefits. Clarissa filed her first claim for the current year last month, an $80 bill for dental X-rays. She paid the bill herself and then submitted the bill to her group plan administrator, for the record. The group plan did not reimburse Clarissa anything, but her deductible for dental benefits for the current year was reduced to $20 ( $100 - $80). Example 2 Tomas is a member of the same group plan as Clarissa. His first dental claim of the year was $800 for a complicated extraction, requiring a general anaesthetic. Tomas submitted his claim but was not reimbursed for the first $100 of the claim, due to the deductible. The balance of $700 ( $800 - $100) qualified for reimbursement under the group plan. There are generally two types of annual deductibles when group extended health insurance covers both the plan members along with their families: An individual deductible; A family deductible. The individual deductible is most often lower than the family deductible. If a family member has filed claims that used up all of the individual deductible, no further deductible will be applicable to that person for the rest of the year. Individual deductible claims from any family member will diminish the family deductible dollar-for-dollar. Regardless of whether the individual uses their deductible or not\u2014individual deductibles will no longer be applicable to any family members for the rest of the year once the family deductible has been depleted. Example John and Marsha are a married couple with one child, Colton. John is a member of a group extended health insurance plan that covers his whole family. For dental claims, the plan has a $100 individual deductible and a family deductible of $250. In February of the current year, John filed a dental claim for $80. He received no reimbursement, but his individual deductible was reduced from $100 to $20 and the family deductible was reduced from $250 to $170. In March, Marsha filed a dental claim for $120. Her individual deductible was reduced to $0 and the remaining family deductible was reduced from $170 to $70. $20 of the claim qualified for reimbursement. In May, John filed another dental claim for $100. His remaining individual deductible was reduced from $20 to $0 and the remaining family deductible was reduced from $70 to $50. $80 of the claim qualified for reimbursement. In July, a claim was filed for $70 of dental expenses for Colton. With a family deductible of $50 at that time, $20 of the claim for Colton qualified for reimbursement. The family deductible is now reduced to $0. In September, an additional claim for $130 of dental expenses was filed for Colton. The entire $130 qualified for reimbursement, because the family deductible had already been reduced to $0. The deductible is applicable annually\u2014it restarts anew each year on the group contract\u2019s anniversary date. The co-insurance factor is also applicable to some benefit claims. The co-insurance factor applies against every claim once the deductible has been paid. Co-insurance factors are most commonly applicable to dental benefits\u2014which benefits are applicable varies between plans. Both a deductible and co-insurance factor may be applicable when either only a few claims are filed by a plan member or claims are only filed early on in the year. Example Kashif is a member of an employer\u2019s group insurance plan that has a $100 annual deductible and an 80% co-insurance factor for dental claims. Last week Kashif went to the dentist and had two extractions and some other work done, costing $800. Kashif paid the $800 bill himself and submitted a claim for $800 to the group plan administrator, his first claim of the current year. The first $100 was not reimbursed because of the plan\u2019s $100 deductible (but the deductible was reduced to $0 for future claims for the current year). Of the remaining $700 of the claim, the group plan reimbursed Kashif $560, 80% under the co-insurance factor ( $700 \u00d7 80%). In total, the plan paid $560 of the $800 claim and Kashif paid $240 ( $800 \u2013 $560). 4.3.2.2 Reimbursement \u00b6 Reimbursement refers to when a plan member pays up front for costs, files a claim with accompanying receipts with the plan administrator and is then reimbursed by the plan insurer based on receipts, deductible, and co-insurance. 4.3.2.3 Direct billing \u00b6 Direct billing refers to when the plan member is provided a membership card or the plan is registered directly with their dentist, pharmacist, etc., and the covered expenses are billed directly to the group plan insurer by the provider. For example, when a pharmacist fills a prescription and directly bills the expense to the group plan because the insured\u2019s plan is registered with the pharmacy. The plan member only pays for optional expenses or expenses over set limits of coverage. For example, the insured paying for the difference of price between the generic and brand-name prescription. 4.3.3 Taxation of group extended health insurance premiums and benefits \u00b6 Employer-sponsored group extended health plans typically pay 100% of the premium on behalf of the employee. Coverage for family members may have to be paid by the employee. Premiums paid by an employer are usually a deductible expense for the employer. They are not a taxable benefit to the plan member. Benefits are tax-free for the employee and their family. Qu\u00e9bec is an exception where premiums paid by an employer are a: Deductible expense to the employer; Taxable benefit to the covered plan member for the calendar year in which they are paid. Group plan benefits in Qu\u00e9bec are tax-free to the plan member and their family. 4.3.4 Integrating an individual policy with a group policy \u00b6 An individual policy can fill in the gaps of an employer-provided health care plan. Insured\u2019s may choose to purchase an individual insurance plan to supplement their group health plan due to coverage limits, co-insurance limits or when the coverage does not meet their needs. For instance, if the group vision plan provides up to $350 in coverage, the individual plan could provide an extra $500 in coverage to bring coverage more in line with actual costs. Example Aarne is married and the father of two pre-teen girls. He is a resident of British Columbia and his whole family has basic health coverage through the universal provincial government plan. Additionally, Aarne participates in the group benefits plan where he works, which offers, among others, group extended health benefits. Aarne is concerned that the group plan may not meet all of his family\u2019s needs, for the following reasons: It offers no accidental death and dismemberment coverage; It only allows for vision care benefits to a maximum of $100 every two years; It limits orthodontic dental care to a maximum of $2,500 lifetime, per insured person. To resolve his concerns Aarne took out an individual extended health policy, with family coverage, structured to provide the following benefits: AD&D coverage; Vision care benefits of up to $250 per family member, every year; Orthodontic dental care coverage to a limit of $2,500 per year with no co-insurance factor. 4.4 Comparing Individual and Group Policies \u00b6 Table 4.2 illustrates and compares some of the characteristics of individual and group extended health coverage.","title":"Chapter 4 Insurance to Protect Savings"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_4_Insurance_to_Protect_Savings/#chapter-4-insurance-to-protect-savings","text":"","title":"Chapter 4: Insurance to Protect Savings"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_4_Insurance_to_Protect_Savings/#41-types-of-extended-health-coverage-to-protect-savings","text":"Extended health coverage provides coverage for many medical expenses.

A policy may be purchased directly from an agent - the policy owner is typically the person who makes claims and receives the policy benefits.

They may apply to all forms of coverage as well as both individual and group plans. A deductible refers to a dollar cost that the insured must pay in full of otherwise covered benefits before insurance claims will be paid by the insurance company. A deductible is charged annually and restarts anew every year. A deductible is most common in a group plan. Example Jose\u2019s extended health insurance plan has a $100 annual deductible for dental benefits: he must pay the first $100 of dental expenses annually himself, without reimbursement from his plan.

Routine maintenance is just as its name describes: routine dental services to maintain healthy teeth. It includes: Regular check-ups; Periodic X-rays; Cleaning; Fillings; Extractions. There is an annual maximum to what will be paid for routine services and often co-insurance that requires the insured to pay 20%-25% of costs. Major restorative services include crowns, bridges, dentures and other major dental procedures. A much higher co-insurance factor applies to major restorative services\u2014the insured may be required to pay as much as 50% of the cost. Claims for both categories are also limited to a fee schedule set provincially by each dental association. For example, if a provincial dental association has a schedule that specifies a filling costs $200, and an insured\u2019s claim for a filling is $250, the insured will need to pay the $50 in excess ( $250 - $200 = $50). For extensive dental care (i.e., in the $500 or more range), insurers generally require that the insured have the dentist submit an estimate before the dental work takes place in order to predetermine coverage cost. Example Igor\u2019s dentist charges $300 for a basic tooth extraction. The provincial dental schedule sets the price of a standard extraction at a maximum of $225.

Medical expenses incurred abroad may be reimbursed by the provincial health care plan of the patient according to the schedule set by the provincial health-care plan. Because provincial health coverage varies among the different provinces, an expense may be covered in one province but not another. The patient must be prepared to pay costs charged outside Canada personally and then file receipts with their provincial plan on their return. For example, if the AHCIP (Alberta health care plan) schedule is set at $175 for a visit to the office of a specialist in the U.S., and the cost paid by the patient is $375, the patient pays $375 and gets $175 from AHCIP.

Travel insurance is particularly critical when travelling with the cost of hospitalization being generally higher abroad than it is in Canada and can be draining to an individual\u2019s savings and cash flow if that individual is not insured. Travel insurance coverage is offered by travel agents, and directly from insurers, financial institutions, airlines and online providers.

Example 1 Clarissa is a member of a group plan that has an annual $100 deductible on dental benefits. Clarissa filed her first claim for the current year last month, an $80 bill for dental X-rays. She paid the bill herself and then submitted the bill to her group plan administrator, for the record.

Tomas submitted his claim but was not reimbursed for the first $100 of the claim, due to the deductible. The balance of $700 ( $800 - $100) qualified for reimbursement under the group plan. There are generally two types of annual deductibles when group extended health insurance covers both the plan members along with their families: An individual deductible; A family deductible. The individual deductible is most often lower than the family deductible. If a family member has filed claims that used up all of the individual deductible, no further deductible will be applicable to that person for the rest of the year. Individual deductible claims from any family member will diminish the family deductible dollar-for-dollar. Regardless of whether the individual uses their deductible or not\u2014individual deductibles will no longer be applicable to any family members for the rest of the year once the family deductible has been depleted. Example John and Marsha are a married couple with one child, Colton. John is a member of a group extended health insurance plan that covers his whole family. For dental claims, the plan has a $100 individual deductible and a family deductible of $250. In February of the current year, John filed a dental claim for $80. He received no reimbursement, but his individual deductible was reduced from $100 to $20 and the family deductible was reduced from $250 to $170. In March, Marsha filed a dental claim for $120. Her individual deductible was reduced to $0 and the remaining family deductible was reduced from $170 to $70. $20 of the claim qualified for reimbursement. In May, John filed another dental claim for $100. His remaining individual deductible was reduced from $20 to $0 and the remaining family deductible was reduced from $70 to $50. $80 of the claim qualified for reimbursement. In July, a claim was filed for $70 of dental expenses for Colton. With a family deductible of $50 at that time, $20 of the claim for Colton qualified for reimbursement. The family deductible is now reduced to $0. In September, an additional claim for $130 of dental expenses was filed for Colton. The entire $130 qualified for reimbursement, because the family deductible had already been reduced to $0. The deductible is applicable annually\u2014it restarts anew each year on the group contract\u2019s anniversary date. The co-insurance factor is also applicable to some benefit claims. The co-insurance factor applies against every claim once the deductible has been paid. Co-insurance factors are most commonly applicable to dental benefits\u2014which benefits are applicable varies between plans. Both a deductible and co-insurance factor may be applicable when either only a few claims are filed by a plan member or claims are only filed early on in the year.

Of the remaining $700 of the claim, the group plan reimbursed Kashif $560, 80% under the co-insurance factor ( $700 \u00d7 80%).

To resolve his concerns Aarne took out an individual extended health policy, with family coverage, structured to provide the following benefits: AD&D coverage; Vision care benefits of up to $250 per family member, every year; Orthodontic dental care coverage to a limit of $2,500 per year with no co-insurance factor.","title":"4.3.4 Integrating an individual policy with a group policy"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_4_Insurance_to_Protect_Savings/#44-comparing-individual-and-group-policies","text":"Table 4.2 illustrates and compares some of the characteristics of individual and group extended health coverage.","title":"4.4 Comparing Individual and Group Policies"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_5_Insurance_to_Protect_Businesses/","text":"Chapter 5: Insurance to Protect Businesses \u00b6 5.1 Forms of Business Ownership \u00b6 The type of business structure an individual (or group of individuals) chooses for business has an effect on multiple issues such as: The simplicity and administrative costs of operating the business; The tax rate on business profits; and The amount of liabilities (including creditors) the business owner is exposed to. The following types of business structures as well as their advantages and disadvantages are examined in this chapter: Sole proprietorships; Partnerships; and Corporations. 5.1.1 Sole proprietorship \u00b6 A sole proprietorship is the least formal structure for business ownership where there is one owner of an unincorporated business. Sole proprietorships include many different types of businesses such as self-employed individulas, consultants, artists, independent tradesmen, etc. In Canada, the majority of businesses are sole proprietorships. In some provinces, a modest fee is required to register a sole proprietorship. Sole proprietorship advantages: Inexpensive to set up. Easy to set up and operate. Sole proprietorship disadvantages: The financial affairs of a sole proprietorship and the personal financial affairs of the sole proprietor are indivisible (i.e., no legal differentiation between owner and business); The net income of the proprietorship is the income of the proprietor (and is reported on the sole proprietor\u2019s personal tax return); Therefore, the business cannot be taxed at a lower rate; and The sole proprietor\u2019s assets are exposed to the business creditors of the proprietorship. 5.1.2 Partnerships \u00b6 A partnership is composed of two or more individuals carrying on a business together with the primary goal of earning a profit. Each partner has a partnership interest. Partnership advantages: Partnership costs shared among partners; Partners share revenues and expenses according to partnership agreements; Net income is reported pro rata (in proportion) to the individual partners as stated in the partnership agreement; and Income tax is not calculated at the partnership level - the net income is reported to the partners and taxed at each partner\u2019s personal tax rate. Partnership disadvantages: The financial affairs of a partnership and the personal financial affairs of the partnership owners are indivisible (i.e., no legal differentiation between owners and business); Partners may be held jointly liable for debts and liabilities of the partnership. This means the actions of one partner can affect all partners even if they were not involved in creating the liability. 5.1.3 Corporations \u00b6 A corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners who are shareholders. Corporations are divided into two main categories\u2014private and public. The corporation itself carries on business through the efforts of its owner/operator(s) and employees. Shares are created by a corporation. The individuals who receive or purchase those shares are the shareholders of the corporation. Shares correspond to pro-rata interest in the net value of the corporation. Control of the corporation is affected through shared voting rights. Corporations may be small, closely held businesses or large, multinational operations. Corporations are taxed on their net income, often distributing their after-tax income to shareholders in the form of dividends, which are taxed in the hands of the business owner at substantially lower rates than salary or interest: Like policy dividends, stock dividends are not guaranteed; and Shares have value and an adjusted cost base that can lead to a capital gain or loss when they are sold. Shareholders are not responsible for corporate debt or liabilities. 5.1.3.1 Privately held \u00b6 Shares of a private corporation are not publicly traded. Shares are issued to employees and others interested in the business who are generally the owners/operators of the business. In Canada, the net income of a private operating company is taxed at a low tax rate. Therefore, a privately held corporation is often established for tax benefit purposes and deferring tax on the company\u2019s profits. Example Willy operates a business that has net income of $200,000 a year, only $150,000 of which is needed to maintain Willy\u2019s personal standard of living. He is in a 45% marginal tax bracket, which is the highest. If he operates a sole proprietorship, the \u201cextra\u201d $50,000 is subject to $22,500 of income tax ( $50,000 \u00d7 45%), leaving Willy with $27,500 ( $50,000 to $22,500) to invest. On the other hand, if Willy\u2019s business was incorporated, the $50,000 of undistributed income would likely be taxed at about 15% in the corporation, leaving about $42,500, after-tax, ( $50,000 \u00d7 (1 \u2013 15%)) to be invested within the corporation. The extra $15,000 ( $42,500 \u2013 $27,500) accumulated after-tax annually would be subject to tax in Willy\u2019s hands if it was ever withdrawn from the corporation, but affords Willy much more investment capital in the meantime. 5.1.3.2 Publicly held \u00b6 Shares of a public corporation are traded freely on a public stock exchange (such as the TSX). Publicly held corporations frequently have tens or hundreds of thousands of shareholders. Shareholders of public corporations are (for the most part) investors who seek to earn capital gains and dividends through share ownership. 5.2 Risks to the Business Owner \u00b6 Disability creates risks specific to the business owner and the business itself. The specific risks related to disability are: Risk of being unable to work due to disability; Risk of being unable to sell the business\u2014a need triggered by disability; Loss of a key employee to disability. 5.2.1 Inability to work \u00b6 The owner of a business has to have the ability to generate an income and meet his creditor\u2019s obligations\u2014this is contingent on the owner\u2019s ability to work and earn revenue. A business owner who is unable to work due to disability risks: Loss of income with its corresponding impact on financial security and savings plans; The inability to meet obligations to creditors, such as business suppliers. 5.2.2 Inability to sell the business \u00b6 A business is typically the most significant personal asset of its owner. The owner must be able to sell the business when they choose at a fair price and within a reasonable period of time. 5.2.2.1 In the event of disability \u00b6 Disability of the owner may force the owner to sell his business in order to provide an income during a period of disability. The business owner will need to find a buyer prepared to pay the right price for his business in a timely fashion upon the onset of disability. Note that disability is often sudden and leaves little time for planning in advance. Finding a potential buyer, negotiating a price and quickly selling the business are all crucial since business revenues may decline and the value of the business will decrease if a disability drags on for a period of time. The owner may have difficulty negotiating a fair price for the business from a position of weakness (that is, the owner\u2019s need to sell). Selling the business or an owner\u2019s share of the business creates instability: Employees will be uncertain of their future; Co-owners may be reluctant to take on a new owner and their methods and expectations; Owners worry about receiving a fair price for their business. 5.2.3 Loss of a key employee \u00b6 A key employee is an employee whose activities are key to the success of the business\u2014this may be as a result of producing sales and revenue, product development, marketing or other essential skills. Loss of a key employee can have devastating effects on the business. 5.2.3.1 In the event of prolonged disability \u00b6 A key employee could be absent from work due to disability. The impact magnifies over time: the longer the employee is away, the more noticeable the effects of their absence. Example Matti\u2019s sole proprietorship printing business relies heavily on the efforts of his sales manager, Ruttu, to develop new business and keep current clients satisfied. If Matti were to lose Ruttu to a disability lasting more than a month or so, the net business income of $200,000 a year would be substantially reduced, particularly since Ruttu is paid a base salary plus commission. Ruttu is an ideal candidate for key person disability insurance coverage. 5.3 Insurance to Address Owners\u2019 Inability to Work \u00b6 Disability income replacement insurance can be used to replace the income of a sole proprietor operating a business with no employees. If a disabled business owner operating a small business with employees becomes disabled and is no longer able to work, the response to maintaining the business during a period of disability is much more complex. 5.3.1 Disability business overhead expense (BOE) insurance \u00b6 Disability business overhead expense (BOE) insurance pays business operating expenses in the absence of the disabled owner. For example, rent charged for business premises is an expense paid by BOE. 5.3.1.1 Purpose of the coverage \u00b6 The disabled owner must cover their own personal income needs with an individual disability income policy. BOE insurance excludes a benefit for the owner. BOE ensures business assets do not have to be sold off and their proceeds used to \u201cpay the bills\u201d. Therefore, it ensures the disabled business owner will have a business to return following his period of disability. Example Tamirru is a professional photographer, operating out of a rented studio, using a leased van for business and employing one part-time assistant. His business earns, on average, $15,000 a month. After allowing for fixed expenses of $4,000 a month, on average, and variable expenses of $2,000 a month, Tamirru\u2019s gross take-home income is $9,000 a month. He has taken out personal disability income replacement insurance that would pay him $5,400 a month (60% of $9,000). That ensures Tamirru has funds to live on during a period of disability but provides no cash flow to maintain the ongoing expenses of the business. If Tamirru were disabled for any length of time, he might have to lay off his assistant and give up his studio and van. 5.3.1.2 Who needs/qualifies for business overhead expense (BOE) insurance? \u00b6 A small business owner who is a sole proprietor or a shareholder of a company with five employees or less qualifies for BOE insurance. BOE insurance is based on the idea that the business owner\u2019s services are so critical to the profitability and success of the business that an interruption of revenues due to disability could severely hurt the business. However, insurance coverage may be reduced or denied if a co-owner or employee can fulfill the responsibilities of the owner. 5.3.1.3 Definition of disability \u00b6 The \u201cown occupation\u201d definition of disability applies. See Chapter 2 for a full explanation of the definition. If the business owner is unable to perform his regular duties with the business, the definition has been met. 5.3.1.4 What expenses qualify for reimbursement? \u00b6 Examples of business expenses that qualify for reimbursement by the policy: Rent; Utilities; Property taxes; Business income taxes; Leases on vehicles and equipment; The interest portion of loans; Employees\u2019 salaries; Phones, internet and other communication charges; Fees of professionals, such as the company accountant. Exceptions to payment include: The disabled owner\u2019s salary, a replacement of the owner, or relatives of the disabled engaged in the business post-disability; New capital expenditures, that is funds spent to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property, industrial buildings or equipment, undertake new projects, or investments by the firm; The principal portion of loans. 5.3.1.5 Benefits \u00b6 The benefit is typically paid monthly as a reimbursement of expenses to the business owner or business itself. It is paid until the owner returns to work, the policy maximum is reached in claims, or the business is sold or ends. 5.3.1.6 Waiting period \u00b6 The benefit period is short and typically begins 15 to 90 days after total disability of the owner due to the fact that the business may quickly fall behind in its financial obligations. 5.3.1.7 Benefit maximums \u00b6 The maximum is set by the policy; it defines the number of months coverage will be provided multiplied by a dollar amount per month. However, the benefit is only paid to reimburse expenses. For example, if the monthly benefit is $5,000. If actual expenses = $3,900, the benefit paid = $3,900; If actual expenses = $5,400, the benefit paid = $5,000. If the full $144,000 of expenses was not claimed within the 24-month period, the policy benefit period would be open-ended, possibly continuing until such time as the entire $144,000 had been claimed. In the example below, Todd\u2019s benefits continue past the first 24 months because the benefit maximum for a business overhead expense insurance policy is not based on a time period but rather a dollar amount as a maximum. The policy will continue until the dollar amount, in Todd\u2019s situation $144,000, has been reached. Example Todd\u2019s BOE policy provides for benefits of $6,000 a month for 24 months, but only $4,200 of expenses are claimed for the first month that benefits are payable. The benefit for that month was only $4,200. The benefit period (24 months) does not really indicate that benefits are only payable for a maximum of 24 months. The maximum monthly benefit multiplied by the benefit period determines the maximum benefit payable under the contract: $144,000 in this case ( $6,000 \u00d7 24 months). If the full $144,000 of expenses was not claimed within the 24-month period, the policy benefit period would be open-ended, possibly continuing until such time as the entire $144,000 had been claimed. 5.3.1.8 Carryover of benefits/expenses \u00b6 Business expenses are variable in nature - some months have higher costs than others. Some contracts acknowledge this by permitting the following. Expenses greater than the monthly benefit to be carried forward and claimed in a future month if benefit room is available. For example, the monthly benefit is $5,000 but expenses are $6,000. The $1,000 can be carried forward to a future month when expenses may be less. Benefit room that is not used in a month when claims are less than the benefit maximum to be carried forward. For example, the monthly benefit is $5,000 but expenses are $4,000. The $1,000 that was not needed can be carried forward to a future month when expenses may exceed $5,000. Benefit room that has not been used over the period of the contract to be carried to the end of the benefit period. For example, if expenses were less by $10,000 over the benefit period and the monthly benefit of the policy was $5,000, two more months of coverage could be provided if the business owner is still disabled. Example 1 Marie\u2019s BOE contract allows for a monthly benefit maximum of $6,000. In the first month of benefit eligibility, the business has qualifying expenses of $6,900. $6,000 of that amount will be reimbursed for the current month and the unclaimed $900 would be carried forward to the next month. If during the next month, a total of $6,600 of qualifying expenses were incurred, another $6,000 would be reimbursed and the $1,500 of unclaimed expenses ( $900 from month one and $600 from month two) would be carried forward to month three. And so on. On the other hand, if there were only $3,000 of qualifying expenses incurred in month three, $4,500 in benefits would be paid out for the month (the $3,000 incurred in month three plus the $1,500 in unclaimed expenses carried forward from the previous months). Example 2 If instead of $6,900 of expenses being incurred in month 1 there has been only $4,800 in qualifying expenses, the full $4,800 would have been reimbursed and $1,200 in potential benefits would have been carried forward to month 2. If $6,600 in qualifying expenses were incurred in month 2, the full $6,600 would have been reimbursed and the remaining $600 ( $1,200 + $6,000 \u2013 $6,600) would be available for carry forward to month 3, and so on. Other policies may carry forward unused benefit amounts, but only to be used at the end of the \u201cnormal\u201d benefit period (e.g., 24 months), in the event that the entire benefit maximum had not been claimed at that time and the business owner was still disabled. 5.3.1.9 Provisions/exclusions \u00b6 A BOE policy may include a variety of standard or optional provisions, including: Waiver of premium; Return of premium; Future purchase option; Clauses for presumptive disability Clauses for partial disability; Residual disability benefit. Standard exclusions apply, such as when disability arises from war, a self-inflicted injury, normal pregnancy, injuries or illness contracted in the course of carrying out criminal activities. 5.3.1.10 Tax treatment of premiums and benefits \u00b6 BOE policies are by and large owned, paid for and payable to the business owner or, in the case of partnerships or incorporated companies, to the business itself. Premiums are a tax-deductible expense for the payor; benefits are taxable income. Benefits paid under business life and disability policies are an exception and are paid tax-free to the business. Nevertheless, the expenses covered by a BOE policy are typically themselves tax-deductible as business overhead, therefore, the tax on the benefit and the deductions of expenses offset each other for tax purposes. Example Lucien\u2019s BOE policy provides for benefits of $6,000 a month, but only $4,200 of expenses are claimed for the first month that benefits are payable. That claim accounted for reimbursement to Lucien\u2019s business of $1,800 of business premises rent, $2,000 of employee salary and $400 of shipping costs for goods distributed. The $4,200 received by the business was treated as taxable income. On the other hand, the $4,200 of expenses paid is a tax-deductible expense. The net effect of the benefits paid and expenses paid is that the business had no tax to pay on the $4,200. 5.3.2 Business loan protection disability insurance \u00b6 Businesses and business owners can purchase a separate disability insurance to make business loan payments during a period of disability. Business loan protection disability insurance establishes the business or business owner as the policyholder. The policyholder pays the premiums and receives the policy benefit. The life insured is the business owner; the \u201cown occupation\u201d definition of disability applies. 5.3.2.1 Purpose \u00b6 The purpose of a business loan protection disability insurance policy is to pay business loans during the period the business owner is disabled. \u201cBusiness loan protection disability contracts\u201d are stand-alone contracts which offer loan protection as a periodic or lump-sum payment in order to cover the business owner\u2019s business loan payment obligations. The policy is best taken out when the loan is acquired. 5.3.2.2 Who needs the coverage? \u00b6 This type of policy is best for sole proprietors, partners, and sole owners of incorporated private businesses. When the revenue of the business is dependent on the good health of the business owner. 5.3.2.3 Eligible loans \u00b6 To qualify for coverage, the loan must meet the following criteria: Essential to business operations; Interest paid on the loan must be tax-deductible; Issued by a financial institution; bank, trust company, credit union or a loan company. 5.3.2.4 Who qualifies for such coverage? \u00b6 The business must: Have at least a three-year record of profitability; Meet a minimum net worth standard; Satisfy the occupational classification set by the insurer, for example, the policy might only be offered to professional firms. Loans that will be covered must be related to business operations such as mortgages on business property, equipment loans, lines of credit, and account overdrafts. 5.3.2.5 Benefits \u00b6 Benefit payments are payable as periodic (i.e., monthly) or lump-sum. Benefits may be paid for loan repayment after an initial waiting period: Periodic benefit payments are typically available up to 24 months; a standard payment is up to $10,000; A lump sum benefit payment of up to $250,000 but limited to no more than 75% of loan value may also be possible. A lengthy waiting period may apply (usually one year). Benefit payments are in place to pay the loan balance. Therefore, the benefits paid do not typically exceed the loan\u2019s amount. 5.3.2.6 Optional benefits \u00b6 Other optional benefits may be available such as a waiver of premium benefit\u2014the most common optional benefit. 5.3.2.7 Exclusions \u00b6 Standard exclusions due to disability arising from war, normal pregnancy, criminal activity or self-inflicted wounds, etc. apply. 5.3.2.8 Tax treatment of premiums and benefits \u00b6 Premiums are not tax-deductible. Benefits are tax-free. Example Hideki is an independent contractor, operating a proprietorship with two employees. Hideki\u2019s business involves digging trenches for the installation of water lines and drainage systems for building contractors and on private property for homeowners. In order to operate his business, Hideki needed to acquire a front-end loader and a small flatbed truck to transport it from site to site, at a total cost of $200,000. Hideki took out a five-year loan from the bank to finance the purchases. Although the work is not overly dangerous, there is always the risk of injury or illness that could interrupt Hideki\u2019s ability to work and earn an income. That, in turn, would impact his ability to make the monthly loan payments to the bank, raising the possibility that the bank could seize his equipment to protect its interests. With this in mind, Hideki applied for a business loan disability policy, with a 60-day waiting period and 60 months of maximum benefits, to protect his investment and the viability of his business. 5.4 Insurance to Address the Owner\u2019s Inability to Sell the Business \u00b6 Every business owner must eventually dispose of his business in terms of: Selling the business; Passing the business down to the next generation; Letting it die or retire with the business owner. It is in the owner and his family\u2019s best interest to pre-plan this eventuality, particularly if the business\u2019s value exceeds the owner\u2019s involvement. 5.4.1 Buy-sell agreements \u00b6 A buy-sell agreement spells out what will happen to the business if the owner or partner dies or is disabled. The document is prepared by a lawyer; the insurance agent suggests how to structure the disability buyout insurance to enable the purchase of the business interest of the disabled. See also the Life Insurance Module, Chapter 8, Section 8.4, which describes the use of buy-sell agreements in the context of the death of an owner or partner. 5.4.1.1 Purpose of an agreement \u00b6 The purpose of the buy-sell agreement is to provide a succession plan for the business\u2014that is, how to fairly accommodate disability of an owner/partner by ensuring they receive fair value for their interest in the business. The buyout mandated by the agreement will not usually take effect until the business owner has been disabled for a lengthy period of time, usually 12 months or longer, to ensure that the disabled owner is not able to participate in the business. The seller (the current owner, or the owner\u2019s estate, heirs or assignees) are bound by the agreement to sell the business interest upon occurrence of the specified event, which is a disability in this case; and the buyers in the agreement are legally bound to buy the interest. Example Lawrence, Daryl and Darrin were three cousins, all in their early forties, who formed a partnership to operate a dental practice. The practice was very successful, with the cousins sharing office space and net profits from the practice, but each owning their own dental equipment. They had often talked about where they hoped the practice would go in the future and how they would look after each other\u2019s families if something happened to one of them, but never took any specific action. Darrin was severely injured in an automobile accident never to be able to return to work or manage his own affairs. His wife, Emily, became responsible for managing his assets, including his dental equipment and his share in the partnership. Lawrence and Daryl wished to acquire Darrin\u2019s equipment, to be used by a young dentist they hoped to bring into the practice, and to buy out Darrin\u2019s partnership interest. Unfortunately, the two dentists and Emily were unable to come to an agreement on price because the two remaining partners lacked the necessary cash on hand to buy Darrin\u2019s interest outright. An installment purchase was finally worked out, which Lawrence and Daryl will be paying off for some years to come yet. Even so, Emily would not relinquish ownership of Darrin\u2019s dental equipment, hoping that her eldest son would be able to use it in his own dental office in a few short years. The remaining partners were forced to go to market to replace the equipment at a cost that was twice what they had hoped to pay for Darrin\u2019s. A lot of issues could have been handled with a buy/sell agreement. The agreement would spell out the terms of the buyout and the method of valuation of the practice and its assets, and and binding the partners and their estates and families to the terms of the agreement. The agreement could have been funded by means of a DI policy specifically designed to provide the capital needed for the buyout. 5.4.1.2 Parties to the agreement \u00b6 The agreement will be written in such a way that whoever becomes disabled becomes the seller. The buyer will depend on the type of business structure: For a sole proprietorship, it is most difficult to find a buyer for the business: the most logical buyers are employees; Partners with a partnership interest will look to their partners to buy their interest; Incorporated private companies will look first to other shareholders to buy the interest of the disabled owner/shareholder. 5.4.1.3 Elements of an agreement \u00b6 The agreement addresses the many variables that will comprise a fair buyout for all parties to the buy-sell agreement. These elements include the following. What has to happen for the buying and selling to occur? This is the requirement for the disabled to satisfy the own occupation definition of disability. Will the current owner be required to sell the business interest? Who is required to buy the business interest? When will the sale occur? This establishes the waiting period before the benefit is paid. What the price will be? How will the buyer(s) pay? Typically, the business buy-sell agreement provisions indicate that the agreement is effective in the event of the disability, critical illness, death or retirement of a current owner. \u201cDisability\u201d is defined under the \u201cown occupation\u201d definition. The buyout mandated under the agreement will not usually take effect until the business owner has been disabled for at least 12 months or longer, ensuring that the disabled owner will not recover and return back to the business. The current owner and the owner\u2019s estate, heirs or assignees are bound under the agreement to sell the business interest upon the occurrence of a specified event, giving the buyer the certainty that they will be able to buy the business. However, the agreement also compels the buyer to buy the business interest, according to the terms of the agreement, once the covered event has occurred, giving the seller the certainty that the business is sold at a fair price. Under a disability buy-sell the purchase and sale must take place within one year (at the very latest) of a current business owner becoming disabled. It is important to establish the price of a business interest in advance. A buy-sell agreement should commit the buyer and the seller to a price that cannot be negotiated when the buy-sell is triggered. The price is established in advance in the agreement as: A fixed price : The set price is determined under the agreement; This price may or may not be indexed annually; The least preferable method; May need adjustment over time as company fortunes rise or fall. A price formula : The parties agree on a formula to value business interest (e.g. a multiple of earnings); This formula is indicated in the buy-sell agreement. A third-party valuator : A third-party assigns a value at the time of selling that will be binding on all parties. A guarantee of the selling price is essential to the buyer and seller. Therefore, parties to the agreement take on the risk of an unknown price when they use the third-party valuator means of assessment. How will the buyer pay ? From personal assets; A loan they take on; Payments taken from the business after the buyer has taken over; Insurance on the life of the disabled owner. The buyer is the policyholder and beneficiary. 5.4.1.4 Types of agreement \u00b6 There are two basic types of buy-sell agreement. An agreement may be structured as a \u201ccriss-cross\u201d agreement in which each shareowner or partner buys disability buy-out insurance on all the other shareowners or partners. Each policyholder pays the policy premium and would receive policy proceeds when disability occurs. For example, the Best Company has three shareholders: Al, Bob and Carl. Al owns a policy naming Bob as insured and another policy naming Carl as insured. Bob owns a policy naming Al as insured and another naming Carl as insured. Carl owns a policy on each of Al and Bob. An entity purchase or share redemption plan in which the business buys disability buyout insurance on its shareholders. The business pays the premiums and receives the insurance proceeds. For example, the Best Company has three shareholders: Al, Bob and Carl. The Best Company has a policy on each of Al, Bob, and Carl. If any of them become disabled according to the terms of the buy-sell agreement, the company receives the insurance proceeds. 5.4.1.5 Taxation issues \u00b6 A cross-purchase sale creates a capital gain or loss for the seller on their shares in the year the sale is completed. A share redemption plan is taxed differently for partners than shareholders: A partner who sells his or her interest to the partnership will report a capital gain or loss in the year the sale is completed. A shareholder is taxed on the amount greater than the paid-up capital value of the shares. The sum is treated as a deemed dividend and taxed as such. 5.4.2 Disability buyout insurance \u00b6 The disability buyout insurance accompanies the buy-sell agreement and provides the funding for the purchase of the business interest of the disabled. The two should be initiated at the same time so that the features of both (waiting period, benefit amount, definition of total disability, structure of the payout, etc.) can be properly coordinated. 5.4.2.1 Definition of total disability \u00b6 The purpose of the buy/sell agreement and the DI policy used to fund it is to provide the capital required to buy out a business owner who is no longer able to perform withing the business. Therefore, the definition of total disability most frequently used as reference is the \u201cown occupation\u201d definition. In certain cases, this definition applies to \u201cown occupation and is not working\u201d meaning the insured owner is unable to carry out his regular duties within the business and is not working in any other occupation within or outside the business. 5.4.2.2 Waiting period \u00b6 The waiting period will be between 12 and 24 months before proceeds are paid. For example, Roger becomes seriously ill and cannot perform the regular duties of his occupation. After 12 months, the buy-sell agreement compels his partner to pay for Roger\u2019s interest in the company. The waiting period in a policy is based on the buy-sell agreement. The long waiting period is to give the business owner time to recover and return to active participation in the business, if possible. 5.4.2.3 Benefit and benefit period \u00b6 The benefit period for a disability buyout policy is typically only one day (but can be up to 10 years/age 65). The benefit is paid at the end of the waiting period to the business owner or business itself. It may be paid in a lump sum, instalments or a combination of the two. 5.4.2.4 Coverage amount \u00b6 Coverage is available up to $2 million. 5.4.2.5 Features of the policy \u00b6 Disability buyout contracts are conditionally renewable and non-cancellable. The premium cannot be changed by the insurance company. The policy must be offered for renewal up to the age specified in the policy or until a specific event occurs, such as the insured leaving the company. Benefits can be: Reduced after the insured attains a specified age, such as age 60; Increased by a future purchase option (FPO) to keep the benefit in line with an increasing business value. 5.4.2.6 Termination of coverage \u00b6 Coverage terminates when the insured is no longer an owner of the company or the company ceases operations. The insured may be able to convert some or all of the coverage to an individual policy without evidence of insurability. Financial need has to be proven. 5.4.2.7 Tax treatment of premiums and benefits \u00b6 Premiums are not tax deductible and they are not a taxable benefit to the insured. Benefits are tax-free. 5.5 Insurance to Address the Loss of a Key Employee \u00b6 Disability insurance is typically put in place to protect the income of an individual in the event of a prolonged period of disability. However, the business employing that individual is an entity unto itself and the income of the business may likewise need protecting in case of interruption due to the disability of an employee. 5.5.1 Key person insurance \u00b6 Key person insurance protects the employer of the key person if they become disabled, critically ill, or dies. The policyholder is the business. The business receives the benefit of the policy. 5.5.1.1 Who is a \u2018key person\u2019? \u00b6 As described in Section 5.2.3, a key employee is an employee whose activities are key to the success of the business and are very difficult to replace - especially in the short term and on a temporary basis. Their services could be as a business owner, a key executive, a technical expert, a systems designer, a trainer/motivator of the sales force, or a variety of other roles that are essential to the success of the organization. 5.5.1.2 Purpose of the coverage \u00b6 Key person insurance provides a benefit to compensate a business for the absence of revenue caused by disability of the key person. The key person is defined as a person whose skills and contributions are unique, and whose contribution is important to the success of the business. Key person disability insurance provides the employer with the necessary cash flow to offset potential losses to the business arising from the key person\u2019s absence from work due to disability. Various insurers place a maximum limit on ownership ranging from 10% to 50% before the individual is disqualified from key person coverage. The types of losses that the key person disability insurance is intended to offset are: Decline in productivity due to the loss of key person\u2019s services; Decline in productivity of other employees due to absence of support from key employees; Decline in sales or networking contacts; Costs of recruiting and training a replacement for the key person, if necessary. 5.5.1.3 Terms of the contract \u00b6 Disability of the key person uses the \u201cown occupation\u201d definition of disability. The policy is conditionally renewable; one condition is the continued employment of the key person by the business. 5.5.1.4 Riders \u00b6 Riders can be added to the policy such as the waiver of premiums, and recurring disability. A replacement expense rider may be available to cover the cost of hiring a replacement for the key person, if necessary. 5.5.1.5 Benefits \u00b6 The maximum benefit is the salary of the key employee to a limit of $15,000 per month. The addition of riders, such as a replacement expense rider, may increase the standard payout. 5.5.1.6 Waiting and benefit periods \u00b6 The waiting period for a key person insurance policy is usually 30 to 90 days. The benefit period is no more than 12 months. The employer will likely have to find a replacement if the insured is going to be off work for more than a few months. 5.5.1.7 Tax treatment of premiums and benefits \u00b6 Key person disability policies are usually owned by, paid for and payable to the employer. Premiums are not tax deductible. Benefits are received tax-free. Example Signs and Lines is an incorporated business with two co-owners and three full-time employees. The company is in the business of designing and installing logos, signs and decorator artwork for commercial enterprises. Mona, their graphic designer, is responsible for 45% of the company\u2019s annual revenue, with about $300,000 of receivables attributable directly to her annually. The two owners are involved primarily in management and promotion and the two other employees handle production, framing and delivery of goods. Realizing that the business depends heavily on the services of Mona, the owners have taken out a key person disability policy on her life, with a 60-day waiting period and a 12-month benefit period, paying $12,500 a month. This would be sufficient to cover overhead and salary expenses for the two other employees, to at least keep the business operating if Mona were to be disabled for a prolonged period of time. 5.6 Other Types of Business Insurance Plans \u00b6 Other types of business insurance plans may also be known as health spending accounts or health care spending accounts. Although these are not \u201cbusiness insurance\u201d in the sense that they do not insure the interests of the business or the business owner, they warrant brief consideration here. Each type of health spending plan pays benefits to the employee(s). 5.6.1 Health and welfare trusts (HWTs) \u00b6 A health and welfare trust (HWT) is an alternative to a group health insurance plan. HWTs are trustee arrangements funded for the sole purpose of providing the employees with health care benefits. The HWT typically provides employees increased flexibility in the choice of benefits than can be found under a typical group plan. Specific requirements for HWTs are set out in the Canada Revenue Agency\u2019s Income Tax Folio S2-F1-C1, Health and Welfare Trusts, dated July 27, 2015 and modified November 27, 2015. 5.6.1.1 Contributions to the trust \u00b6 Contributions are usually made by the employer only, on a mandatory basis, and may never revert to the employer. There is no statutory restriction on the amount of annual or cumulative contributions, although the Income Tax Folio S2-F1-C1 specifies that the employer\u2019s contributions \u201c\u2026must not exceed the amount required to provide health and welfare benefits to employees\u201d. There is no time limit specified during which the employees are required to utilize the contributions to acquire benefits. 5.6.1.2 Income tax implications \u00b6 Contributions are tax deductible for the employer (provided the HWT meets the requirements of Income Tax Folio S2-F1-C1); benefits are not taxable to the employee at any time. 5.6.2 Employee health trusts (EHTs) \u00b6 Employee health trusts (EHTs) are a variation of HWTs. Employee health trusts are complex plans used by medium-to-large employers. Contributions to the trust cannot revert to the employer and must be used to provide specified benefits for the employee and family such as paying premiums for individual or group health insurance. Contributions are tax deductible for the employer; benefits are taxable to the employees. Unlike HWTs, the trust that administers an EHT must in Canada 5.6.3 Personal health spending plans (PHSPs) \u00b6 Also known as private health services plans. Used by sole proprietors, partners and their families for health care benefits. An administrator is appointed to collect contributions. The contributions are used to directly pay health care expenses. Contributions have a specified maximum. They must also be spent for services within two years. Contributions are tax deductible for the employer; benefits are not taxable income. Most PHSPs include travel insurance coverage and an exceptional expense rider to cover such items as a semi-private hospital room. 5.6.4 Grouped disability/critical illness plans \u00b6 A grouped plan is an alternative to a group plan when there are too few employees for a proper group plan to be provided. The employer agrees to acquire, fund and hold disability, accident and sickness, and critical illness contracts for the benefit of two or more employees. Benefits claimed under the policies are paid directly to the employees. The grouped plan is restricted to a class of employees and each member of the class receives similar benefits. If the group is comprised exclusively of shareholders, the plan will lose its tax status in which premiums are deductible to the employee and employer-paid premiums are not taxable income for the employees. Shareholders may be members of a group with employees. If the plan is properly structured, contributions are tax deductible for the employer; benefits are taxable income for employees. Example The XYZ Corporation established a grouped disability plan for its staff in 2011. The plan, in turn, purchased individual disability income replacement policies on the lives of each of its employees. In respect of one employee, Hans, the company paid $800 in premiums in 2012. The company was able to tax-deduct the full $800, but Hans did not have to report a taxable benefit for the premiums paid in 2012. In 2013 Hans received $3,600 in income replacement benefits from the plan when he could not work for several weeks due to a knee injury sustained while playing football. Hans reported a taxable benefit of $3,600 in 2013 due to his disability claim. 5.7 Taxation of Benefits \u00b6 The benefit of a business-owned life insurance policy may be paid to the capital dividend account of the business. It may then be distributed as dividends. Taxable income for the employee is created only when the benefit is paid by a HWT and EHT. Otherwise taxation issues are addressed in the preceding slides within each section. Table 5.1 provides a summary of the income tax implications to the employer and employee arising from the payment of premiums and receipt of benefits under business use DI policies. 5.8 Integrating Business and Personal Disability Coverage \u00b6 Disability insurance coverage is available through: Government plans, such as Canada Pension Plan, which provides disability insurance coverage; Individual insurance policies such as an individual accident and sickness policy or a rider on a life policy; Groups, such as an employer; A business for business owners, partners, and shareholders. The agent must analyze coverage from all sources to ensure there are no duplication of service (and expense) and no needs that remain unfulfilled. The all-sources maximum must be respected: it limits coverage from all sources to no more than 85% of pre-disability income. 5.8.1 Owner\u2019s need for personal insurance \u00b6 Gaps/overlaps may occur when the client is the owner/operator of a business, particularly one with employees. Coverage levels and waiting and benefit periods need to be co-ordinated to avoid any gaps or overlaps in coverage. A disability program focused on protecting the employees would do little or nothing to cover business expenses, generate profits or protect the net income of the business owner. \u2022 A sole proprietor with a personal income replacement disability policy might find his income sufficiently provided for in the event of a prolonged disability, but if his business and employees are not also protected the proprietor might not have a source of income to return to when he recovers. Example Carly is a co-shareholder in an incorporated business with 30 employees. She has three co-owners. The company has key employee coverage on its owners, to ensure the viability of the business in the event of a prolonged disability. It also holds disability buyout policies on the lives of each, to fund a buy-sell agreement. The buyout policies have a 12 month waiting period, so the firm has also taken out disability policies on the shareholders, paying a benefit equal to 50% of their net income, to help the owners maintain their lifestyle during the period between the onset of disability and the triggering of the buyout. The contracts are owned and paid for by the corporation and are payable to it, which would, in turn, pay \u201csalary continuation\u201d to a disabled owner/operator. The plans have a 90-day waiting period and a nine-month benefit period. Since the disability benefits paid to Carly would be taxable, the after-tax income would be insufficient to fully sustain her during a year of disability. She needs to consider taking out a personal DI policy to supplement the coverage provided by her company. Her personal policy might have a waiting period of as little as 30 days and a 12-month benefit period. The level of monthly benefit should be in the range of $10,000 a month for the first 60 days (when no income would be coming from the company plan) and $5,000 a month ( $60,000 a year) for the balance of the 10 months. If Carly was to remain disabled, long-term, coverage would not be necessary after 12 months, as her interest in the company would have been bought out under the insurance funded buy-sell agreement. Additionally, it is important not to over-insure the business or the business owner. The majority of plans will include an \u201call sources maximum\u201d built into their benefit schedule, capping benefits from all plans at 85% of pre-disability income.","title":"Chapter 5 Insurance to Protect Businesses"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_5_Insurance_to_Protect_Businesses/#chapter-5-insurance-to-protect-businesses","text":"","title":"Chapter 5: Insurance to Protect Businesses"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_5_Insurance_to_Protect_Businesses/#51-forms-of-business-ownership","text":"The type of business structure an individual (or group of individuals) chooses for business has an effect on multiple issues such as: The simplicity and administrative costs of operating the business; The tax rate on business profits; and The amount of liabilities (including creditors) the business owner is exposed to.

Shares correspond to pro-rata interest in the net value of the corporation. Control of the corporation is affected through shared voting rights. Corporations may be small, closely held businesses or large, multinational operations. Corporations are taxed on their net income, often distributing their after-tax income to shareholders in the form of dividends, which are taxed in the hands of the business owner at substantially lower rates than salary or interest: Like policy dividends, stock dividends are not guaranteed; and Shares have value and an adjusted cost base that can lead to a capital gain or loss when they are sold.

Example Willy operates a business that has net income of $200,000 a year, only $150,000 of which is needed to maintain Willy\u2019s personal standard of living.

The extra $15,000 ( $42,500 \u2013 $27,500) accumulated after-tax annually would be subject to tax in Willy\u2019s hands if it was ever withdrawn from the corporation, but affords Willy much more investment capital in the meantime.","title":"5.1.3.1 Privately held"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_5_Insurance_to_Protect_Businesses/#5132-publicly-held","text":"Shares of a public corporation are traded freely on a public stock exchange (such as the TSX).

The seller (the current owner, or the owner\u2019s estate, heirs or assignees) are bound by the agreement to sell the business interest upon occurrence of the specified event, which is a disability in this case; and the buyers in the agreement are legally bound to buy the interest. Example Lawrence, Daryl and Darrin were three cousins, all in their early forties, who formed a partnership to operate a dental practice. The practice was very successful, with the cousins sharing office space and net profits from the practice, but each owning their own dental equipment. They had often talked about where they hoped the practice would go in the future and how they would look after each other\u2019s families if something happened to one of them, but never took any specific action. Darrin was severely injured in an automobile accident never to be able to return to work or manage his own affairs. His wife, Emily, became responsible for managing his assets, including his dental equipment and his share in the partnership. Lawrence and Daryl wished to acquire Darrin\u2019s equipment, to be used by a young dentist they hoped to bring into the practice, and to buy out Darrin\u2019s partnership interest. Unfortunately, the two dentists and Emily were unable to come to an agreement on price because the two remaining partners lacked the necessary cash on hand to buy Darrin\u2019s interest outright. An installment purchase was finally worked out, which Lawrence and Daryl will be paying off for some years to come yet. Even so, Emily would not relinquish ownership of Darrin\u2019s dental equipment, hoping that her eldest son would be able to use it in his own dental office in a few short years. The remaining partners were forced to go to market to replace the equipment at a cost that was twice what they had hoped to pay for Darrin\u2019s. A lot of issues could have been handled with a buy/sell agreement. The agreement would spell out the terms of the buyout and the method of valuation of the practice and its assets, and and binding the partners and their estates and families to the terms of the agreement.

This establishes the waiting period before the benefit is paid. What the price will be? How will the buyer(s) pay? Typically, the business buy-sell agreement provisions indicate that the agreement is effective in the event of the disability, critical illness, death or retirement of a current owner. \u201cDisability\u201d is defined under the \u201cown occupation\u201d definition.

However, the agreement also compels the buyer to buy the business interest, according to the terms of the agreement, once the covered event has occurred, giving the seller the certainty that the business is sold at a fair price. Under a disability buy-sell the purchase and sale must take place within one year (at the very latest) of a current business owner becoming disabled. It is important to establish the price of a business interest in advance. A buy-sell agreement should commit the buyer and the seller to a price that cannot be negotiated when the buy-sell is triggered. The price is established in advance in the agreement as: A fixed price : The set price is determined under the agreement; This price may or may not be indexed annually; The least preferable method; May need adjustment over time as company fortunes rise or fall. A price formula : The parties agree on a formula to value business interest (e.g. a multiple of earnings); This formula is indicated in the buy-sell agreement. A third-party valuator : A third-party assigns a value at the time of selling that will be binding on all parties. A guarantee of the selling price is essential to the buyer and seller. Therefore, parties to the agreement take on the risk of an unknown price when they use the third-party valuator means of assessment. How will the buyer pay ?

If Carly was to remain disabled, long-term, coverage would not be necessary after 12 months, as her interest in the company would have been bought out under the insurance funded buy-sell agreement. Additionally, it is important not to over-insure the business or the business owner. The majority of plans will include an \u201call sources maximum\u201d built into their benefit schedule, capping benefits from all plans at 85% of pre-disability income.","title":"5.8.1 Owner\u2019s need for personal insurance"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_6_Client_Profile/","text":"Chapter 6: Client Profile \u00b6 6.1 Personal Situation of the Client \u00b6 An agent must analyze the client\u2019s situation to determine the client\u2019s risks and needs. The client profile should cover the following aspects: Personal situation; Financial situations, including income and expenses; Insurance situation. An accident and sickness insurance recommendation will be based on the conclusions of that analysis. The following personal details need to be taken into consideration during a fact-finding interview: Personal factors unique to the client such as age, gender, and any hobbies; Marital status of the client; Dependents, if any, of the client; Client\u2019s occupation; Current health and health history of the client and their family; Client\u2019s retirement goals. 6.1.1 Personal details \u00b6 How do personal factors relate to insurance need? Age, gender, sports, hobbies, activities and pursuits have a direct bearing on risk. The probability of disability increases with age. It is also higher for women at all ages. A spouse may contribute alternate sources of income. Dependents need financial support in the event of the client\u2019s disability. Women live longer and, therefore, have a need for long-term care insurance that exceeds the needs of men. High-risk activities such as extreme sports require careful assessment since they can make an individual uninsurable, or insurable only with an exclusion. Given that disability insurance is income replacement insurance, the analysis must take into consideration how long the insured expects to work before retirement. 6.1.2 Marital status \u00b6 The agent should determine whether a client is currently single, married, living common-law, or has previously been married or in a common-law relationship. The client\u2019s marital status will have an impact on sources of income and expenses during periods of disability or illness. Financial obligations are greater for those who are married (whether the marriage is legal or common-law) than for those who are single. Married individuals must take into account any financial obligation they have to their spouse and dependent children. This obligation may be reduced by the income earned by the spouse. There may also be support obligations for a former spouse and children. A single person incurs the risk that comes with being alone: no one to provide care during disability, critical illness, or old age. A single person may need money to buy services that a married person might receive from a spouse. Example 1 Henri is single and earns $60,000 a year and would require 60% of his current income to survive during a period of prolonged disability. If he had no other source of income or income replacement, he would need $3,000 a month of disability insurance to support him during a period of disability (( $60,000 \u00d7 60%) \u00f7 12). Example 2 Henri\u2019s brother, Jacques, and his wife, Marie, each earn $60,000 a year and would require 60% of their combined incomes, or $6,000 a month, to live if either of them was to become disabled (( $60,000 \u00d7 2) \u00d7 60% \u00f7 12). However, in the event of Jacques\u2019s disability, Marie would still be earning $5,000 a month, and vice versa, leaving a shortfall of only $1,000 a month should one of them become disabled and unable to work. Each of Jacques and Marie might only require $1,000 a month of disability insurance to protect the family in the event of the disability of one or the other, although a higher level of coverage would likely be prudent, to guard against eventualities (one spouse might need to work part time to help to care for the other). 6.1.3 Dependents \u00b6 Who depends on the client for support? Who might depend on the client for support in the future? Dependents may include: A spouse, during a period of disability or later in life; Children, before they become financially independent of their parents; Other family members, including parents or siblings. 6.1.4 Occupation \u00b6 The risk of the client\u2019s occupation will determine: Types of disability policies that can be offered; The policy waiting period; The benefit period; The premium. Note that knowledge of a client\u2019s occupation is important in terms of insurance. However, the amount of critical illness and long-term care insurance required is not primarily determined by occupation. 6.1.4.1 Duties \u00b6 Occupations are classified according to their risk of disability. Risk relates not only to the physical environment (hazardous conditions, noxious chemicals, etc.) but also to the amount of exertion and stress to which the person is exposed. The duties of an occupation will also impact the insurance offer. Underwriters examine the physical requirements of the job, length of the work week, and annual vacation allotment. 6.1.4.2 Work history \u00b6 It is helpful for the agent to know his client\u2019s work history. For example, some jobs, such as mining, could potentially lead to postponed physical ailments. Has the client worked in a more hazardous occupation than currently? How long? How frequently does the client change jobs? 6.1.4.3 Future work plans \u00b6 Does the client plan to change jobs soon, or retire? A new job may present a different occupational classification. The amount of income the client earns from their work may change and if so, this change will affect the benefit needed. 6.1.5 Health \u00b6 Health conditions indicate a need for accident and sickness (A&S) products, however, issues arising from health issues or concerns may limit policies and their benefits. For example: Current or past health problems could lead to illness or injury, resulting in disability claims; Health factors such as diabetes, hypertension or smoking are risk factors for heart attack and stroke, which could lead to a claim under a critical illness policy; Factors like diabetes could lead to other debilitating conditions, which may require facility or home care under a long-term care policy; Those with health problems are likely to have increased numbers of claims and medical expenses under an extended health care policy. 6.1.5.1 Personal health history \u00b6 Risk assessment is based on the applicant\u2019s health history, including any past disability claims. The medical underwriting questionnaire of A&S coverage places importance on the applicant\u2019s present and past state of health. If the client\u2019s medical past is too complicated, the client might be subject to severe coverage restrictions. Full details about any former disability claims must be provided during the underwriting process. 6.1.5.2 Family health history \u00b6 Risk assessment also looks at the applicant\u2019s immediate family for conditions that may be prevalent or genetic. Longevity may be a limiting factor for long-term care insurance since a longer life span would indicate a higher probability for care, and over a longer period. Particularly in CI or LTC insurance, prevalent or genetic family risk factors would likely lead to a restriction of coverage and/or benefits or a decline of coverage altogether. 6.1.6 Retirement goals \u00b6 When the client plans to retire is an important factor for an agent to consider when that agent designs an A&S insurance program. The scheduled retirement date determines how long benefits would be payable under a disability income replacement program. 6.1.6.1 Travel and living abroad or living at home \u00b6 The quality of retirement life that the client anticipates dictates the A&S program design, particularly in respect of critical illness and long-term care insurance. If the client plans to travel extensively in retirement, there may be an increased need for critical illness and long-term care insurance. If the client is planning on living abroad for extended periods every year (e.g., winters in Florida) their situation will call for travel insurance, health insurance, and long-term care policies. Health costs in a foreign jurisdiction might be much higher than in Canada. 6.2 Client Income \u00b6 There are many sources of income to consider. Bear in mind that the purpose of reviewing all client income sources, both earned and unearned, is to understand where money comes from, its amount and dependability, and whether it will continue during a period of disability or illness. The client\u2019s income is a less important factor in assessing the need for CI and LTC insurance since the products are intended to provide benefits to pay for expenses, not replace income. 6.2.1 Sources of earned income \u00b6 For the pre-retirement client, aside perhaps from investment income, income from employment or self-employment will be the mainstay of providing for living expenses, savings and investments, etc. It is critical for the agent to be able to identify not only the source and amount of employment income but to assess its consistency and future viability. 6.2.1.1 Salary, bonuses and commission income from working \u00b6 It is important for the agent to obtain a breakdown of earned income from the client and distinguish between salary earned by the client, bonuses, and commission income. Salary is most stable and predictable. Bonuses and commissions may be highly variable and undependable, and hence, the consistency of bonuses and commissions needs to be assessed. Income from commissions should be looked at over several years to determine its consistency. 6.2.1.2 Business income \u00b6 Business income must be examined for consistency. If the client works for himself, in partnership with others, or is an employee with one organization but also has additional sources of earned income, the agent should look into details of the business itself and the history of the non-employment income source(s) to assess the viability and consistency of the business income stream. If business overhead insurance will keep the business afloat during a disability, the need of the business owner for an individual policy must be taken into consideration. 6.2.2 Sources of unearned income \u00b6 When considering a client\u2019s overall sources of replacement income, or income to defray medical or care expenses, earned income is generally the first thing that an agent will review. \u201cPassive\u201d income must also be taken into consideration: income available to the client even when he is not working. Passive income could include income earned by other family members, investment income, income received as the beneficiary of a trust or sources of cash flow that are not strictly \u201cincome\u201d but which could be utilized as a substitute for income. 6.2.2.1 Income earned by spouse \u00b6 The spouse\u2019s income contributes to income needs of the couple or family and may continue during disability of the other spouse. Spousal income may be reduced if the spouse must take time away from work to care for the disabled spouse. 6.2.2.2 Investment income \u00b6 Investment income (interest, dividends and capital gains) may be earned on either registered or non-registered investments. Income earned in a registered account, such as an RRSP, does not contribute to pre-retirement cash flow. Investment income from non-registered accounts contributes to income before disability and will continue after disability. Any investment that can be converted from an accumulation mode to payout mode in case of emergency may need to be factored into an income replacement calculation. Allowance also needs to be made for market downturns, when investment values might be depleted and it is not advisable to liquidate assets. 6.2.2.3 Support payments \u00b6 A divorced or separated client may be in receipt of either spousal or child support payments or both. These payments would be a factor in calculating both pre-disability and post-disability income, since payments to the client would still be payable regardless of whether the client was disabled, had suffered a critical illness or was in need of long-term care. It is important to know how much the payments are, whether they are taxable or tax-free income, how frequently they are paid, and for how long into the future they will be payable. Support payments could be a critical income source as part of the overall plan. As such, in the planning process it is important to consider is the payor\u2019s long-term ability to make those payments if the payor was to become disabled. 6.2.2.4 Pension income \u00b6 Pension income\u2014government, corporate or private\u2014can be a source of replacement income for a disabled earner or a resource to help defray the costs of a critical illness or long-term care. In the case of the pre-retirement client, it is important to ascertain what sources of pension income can be available in the future, when the pension can begin and how much would be payable at different start dates. Should the client become long-term or permanently disabled prior to retirement, future pension income could replace much or all of his income lost to disability. The amount of disability income replacement benefit would then be the amount required to fill the income gap between the date of a possible disability and the date(s) that the client\u2019s pension(s) could commence. 6.2.2.5 Royalties and other income sources \u00b6 Similar to investment and pension income, ongoing royalties and residuals for work or past work continue to be paid regardless of the client\u2019s ability to work in the present or the future. These payments must be taken into consideration in calculating the client\u2019s current and future income. The agent should also inquire as to the possibility that the client is, or will be in the future, the recipient of income from a trust or estate established by a grandparent, parent or other family member or individual. If such funds are being received currently, it is important to ascertain the amount of trust income received annually, the frequency of payments and the future duration of the payments. Example Clarence is named as income beneficiary for his father\u2019s estate, with the capital residue of the estate to be paid to Clarence\u2019s children at his death. At present Clarence\u2019s father, aged 78, is alive and relatively healthy for his age, so no income is forthcoming from the \u201cestate\u201d to Clarence, nor is it known when such income might commence or how much it might be. Such speculative income cannot be factored into Clarence\u2019s estate and financial planning, but its potential existence still should be recorded as part of an overall review. 6.2.2.6 Disability income \u00b6 The client\u2019s existing sources of disability income benefits must be taken into consideration when assessing the need for additional coverage. Existing sources of disability income could be private insurance plans, group plans, or government plans like CPP or the Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP) and Workers\u2019 Compensation and Employment Insurance. Details can be obtained from policies, group benefits booklets, Service Canada or provincial agencies responsible for managing government plans. 6.2.3 In-kind income \u00b6 In-kind income is income offered on an exchange basis for unpaid services instead of cash - for instance, from a stay-at-home caregiver. 6.2.3.1 Contribution to elder care from stay-at-home caregiver \u00b6 In the case of a client in need of in-home care due to illness, injury or the effects of ageing, the care services of a live-in family member can be considered to be a form of \u201cincome\u201d. The care provided for free replaces professional services. Such care could be in the form of cooking, cleaning, bathing or other personal or household services that the client might not be able to perform for himself. The \u201cincome\u201d provided by such services is indirect: the free care eliminating expenses that would otherwise be paid to a third party. 6.2.3.2 Community programs \u00b6 Many services are provided by publicly funded agencies and their value can be considerable including in-home care, rehabilitative care at community centres, Meals on Wheels, and like services available in the client\u2019s community. The simplest way to find information about the types of service available to the client is through an organization like the Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs) (Ontario). LHINs can provide contact information for such services and for visiting health professionals, including nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, dietitians, pharmacists, respiratory therapists and social service workers. 6.2.4 Other sources of income \u00b6 The concept of \u201cincome\u201d is classically defined as \u201c\u2026 the money or other gain periodically received by an individual, corporation, etc., for labour or services, or from property, investments, etc.\u201d However, in times of need personal savings and assets can also contribute to cash flow needs. 6.2.4.1 Emergency funds and other assets \u00b6 An emergency fund is recommended to cover three to six months\u2019 living expenses. If money has been set aside for emergency purposes and to help cover extraordinary expenses, it can be factored into the plan for benefits. Other assets may not be expressly designated as an emergency fund but, if they can be accessed quickly and with little or no negative tax consequences, they could also fulfill the role of, or augment emergency funds. 6.3 Client Expenses \u00b6 It was noted previously that disability income would be based on replacing 60% of the insured\u2019s active income from working. An alternative approach is to base the benefit on actual living expenses if they are lower than the 60% threshold. For instance, replacing income could require $5,000 per month of benefits. However, expenses are just $2,500 per month. Therefore, the disability benefit could be based on the lower sum and carry a lower premium. Critical illness benefits are a best-guess estimate of what the insured might need\u2014or want\u2014in the case of serious illness. The insured must be able to afford the premium as his cash flow will attest. Coverage for long-term care insurance is hard to estimate. Premium affordability will be key. Bear in mind that the purpose of reviewing all client expenses is to understand how much is required in a benefit or benefits, and when it is required. Example Sofia is a freelance translator and earns on average $60,000 of pre-tax income annually. Her portion of family expenses such as mortgage payments and groceries amounts to $2,000 a month. Because she would not be able to continue obtaining contracts if she was to become disabled, she wishes to purchase disability insurance. Based on an income approach, her agent could recommend monthly benefits of $3,000, i.e., 60% of her pre-tax monthly income ( $60,000 \u00f7 12 \u00d7 60%). Based on an expense approach, her agent could recommend monthly benefits of $2,000. Both would be appropriate, and the final decision would have to take into consideration other factors, such as affordability. 6.3.1 Living expenses \u00b6 Living expenses to be covered by a disability income or critical illness policy are the expenses incurred by living: housing, food, clothing, vehicle expenses, and so on. When a budget of living expenses exists, it will be far easier to estimate insurance coverage needs. 6.3.1.1 Mortgage statement or rental agreement \u00b6 A client\u2019s mortgage or rent payments are usually the largest single monthly expenditure. Thus, the amount paid and mortgage duration are key to living expenses. The agent must explore the client\u2019s terms of the mortgage or rental agreement to understand how this expense will be impacted by a period of disability or illness. 6.3.1.2 Bank statements \u00b6 Bank statements over a period of a year indicate the client\u2019s expenses and spending. The bank statements will indicate the minimum amount required to maintain the client and his family along with the family budget. Net worth and income and expense statements can be used instead of bank statements to show spending. 6.3.1.3 Budget \u00b6 A family or individual budget is helpful to show how money is spent, which expenses are mandatory and which expenses are optional. Expenses are allotted to categories such as housing, food, entertainment, and others limited to the individual, such as a club membership. Accuracy in determining expenses is important to determine coverage amount and duration. This example budget indicates the types of income and expenses that should be tracked on a monthly basis. *Money Instructor. Sample monthly household budget: http://content.moneyinstructor.com/437/sample-budget.htm 6.3.2 Savings and investments \u00b6 Saving and investing are a double-sided coin regarding cash flow during periods of disability or a debilitating illness. The client\u2019s savings and investment accounts can be used to substitute or supplement current income if earned income is reduced due to disability. Nevertheless, if the client typically contributes to these plans he may wish to continue the contributions, even during periods of reduced income. This guarantees the accumulation of sufficient retirement income or wealth for his estate. These plans could also be seen as a liability, with the contributions being a cash drain, similar to other personal and household expenses. The best way to establish the nature and extent of savings/investment plans is to review the client\u2019s documentation and statements regarding: Registered investment accounts; Non-registered investment accounts; Pension plans; Life insurance. 6.3.2.1 Registered investment account statements \u00b6 The client\u2019s RRSPS and TFSAs can be a source of capital to replace lost income or pay extraordinary medical or care expenses. Statements for registered investment accounts can show the character of individual investments, sums available, their liquidity (ability to be sold and turned into cash), maturity dates, and surrender charges. In the case of RRSPs or registered retirement income funds (RRIFs) allowance would have to be made for tax payable on withdrawals if consideration was being given to surrendering part or all of the accounts to supplement lost income or to pay medical or care bills. It should also be kept in mind that both capital investments and accrued income can be withdrawn from a TFSA tax-free. A registered disability savings plan (RDSP) can provide income for a person who is disabled and receives the Disability Tax Credit (DTC). A person who is the beneficiary of an RDSP would not qualify for disability or other health insurance. RDSPs are registered plans approved by the federal government to provide qualifying disabled beneficiaries with a tax-deferred savings program and support payments in their later years. A disabled person is eligible to be a beneficiary of an RDSP who: Is eligible for the Disability Tax Credit (disability amount); Is a Canadian resident; Is under 60 years of age (if 59, the individual must apply before the end of the calendar year in which he turns 59); and Has a social insurance number. Contributions are not tax-deductible. There is no annual limit for a private contribution to a plan. In 2018, the lifetime private contribution limit for an RDSP was $200,000. The federal government may pay a matching Canada Disability Savings Grant, depending on the amount contributed and the beneficiary\u2019s family income. The government may also pay a Canada Disability Savings Bond into the RDSPs of low-income and modest-income Canadians. Investment income earned in the plan accumulates tax-free. However, grants, bonds and investment income earned in the plan are included in the beneficiary\u2019s income for tax purposes when paid out of the RDSP. 6.3.2.2 Non-registered investment account statements \u00b6 Like registered accounts, non-registered investment account statements will show the type of investments and sum invested. Sale or surrender of investments held in the account may result in immediate tax charges. The statements from the account manager or fund should provide the current ACB for the client\u2019s account or investments, facilitating the calculation of capital gains reportable upon surrender of assets. 6.3.2.3 Pension plan statements \u00b6 A pension plan is a valuable asset to its owner. A client\u2019s pension plan may be a source of income to supplement earnings lost to disability or to help to pay medical bills or the costs of long-term care. Statements are provided to the owner annually confirming the value of pension savings, when the pension may begin, and how much will be received based on pension savings and age at retirement. 6.3.2.4 Life insurance statements \u00b6 Cash value life insurance can also serve as a valuable asset. The client is likely to be able to provide both the policy itself and the most recent annual statement from the issuing insurance company. Life insurance statements will disclose: The premium and frequency to which it is payable (i.e., monthly); The most recent policy dividend (in participating whole life policies); and The cash surrender value (CSV) of the policy at the last anniversary. Life insurance policies will show if the contract provides periods during which no premiums need to be paid to the policyholder (i.e., \u201cpremium holidays\u201d) and if there is a waiver-of-premium rider in place that would eliminate the premium expense after a three to six-month period. Cash value life insurance could be a source of cash flow during emergencies in the following ways: Annual policy dividends paid to the policyholder; The cash value could indicate an amount available as a policy loan; Premium holidays which lead to a reduction in expenses; and Waiver of premiums during disability. 6.3.3 Debt \u00b6 Debt load is the amount a person owes and is of particular interest to an insurance agent for the following reasons: Debt is typically paid on a monthly basis and is therefore very important to the budget and amount of cash flow needed in the event of disability; Debt requires regular monthly repayments, and ideally full repayment before retirement; A large debt load reflects on the insured\u2019s ability to manage cash and tolerate risk. 6.3.3.1 Personal line of credit and Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) statements \u00b6 The client may have an unsecured personal line of credit with his financial institution and/or a home equity line of credit, secured by his home. These credit lines are amounts that the client can draw upon at any time. These statements show how much can be borrowed, how much is borrowed, and the minimum monthly payment required to keep the account in good standing. Their cost of borrowing is far less than credit cards. Available balances can be used for credit card repayment to improve cash flow. As with credit cards, the unused portion of personal lines of credit can, in extreme cases, be regarded as a source of emergency funds. 6.3.3.2 Credit card statements \u00b6 Credit cards are available from different sources such as banks, credit unions, retail stores and gas stations. Most clients will have at least one credit card. A credit card statement will show how much can be borrowed, how much is borrowed, and the minimum monthly payment required to keep the account in good standing. The simplest way to review the status of a client\u2019s credit card accounts is to examine his three most recent monthly statements. This will demonstrate how often the client uses the cards, the level of purchases normally made, the average monthly payment, whether the client discharges the balance in full each month and the credit limit. If not, the most recent statement would provide information regarding the current balance on hand and the interest charged on the balance. Some cards provide accidental death insurance, job loss protection, and travel insurance which will be outlined in the statement. 6.3.3.3 Tax liabilities \u00b6 Tax may be due or owed for: Income tax as shown in the Income Tax Return (In Qu\u00e9bec, the provincial income tax return); Corporate income tax; GST/HST as shown in the GST return; Residential rental, or vacation property tax. 6.3.3.4 Other liabilities \u00b6 The client may also have support obligations to a spouse or dependants, lawsuits that will require a settlement, or the desire to support family members, such as parents. 6.4 Financial Situation of the Client \u00b6 Gathering all the foregoing information is intended to reveal whether: The client has sufficient resources to cover the loss of income for one year; The client has sufficient resources to pay the expenses of a medical emergency lasting one year. 6.4.1 Net financial position \u00b6 Net worth is determined as assets minus liabilities. However, many factors will impact the value of assets\u2014such as whether a forced sale of an asset would result receiving a lower value. It is important for the agent to ensure the approach taken is consistent throughout his analysis to produce a coherent recommendation. 6.4.1.1 Review of assets \u00b6 A net worth statement will ideally list all assets (rather than cash flow), valued at their current fair market value. The agent must determine what assets are currently available\u2014that is, they could be converted to cash within 12 months. Certain assets, like the family home, should not be considered saleable assets because they cannot be converted to cash immediately. 6.4.1.2 Debt \u00b6 The liability statement would include such items as mortgages, bank loans, credit card balances and unpaid taxes. Liabilities are examined to determine current and long-term obligations. The agent should determine if the client, in the event of a disability or medical emergency, has sufficient resources to cover his income loss, medical and/or care expenses for at least one year. The following example presents a sample format for a standard Net Worth Statement. 6.4.1.3 Cash flow statement \u00b6 The cash flow statement lists net income and all expenses (including debt liabilities). If income is more than expenses, then cash flow is available for disability or medical expenses. Details on expenses will illustrate which could be curtailed so that insurance premiums can be paid. The cash flow statement can be developed for a period of time as long as a year or as short as a month. It is most accurate when it is backed up with a budget based on actual spending patterns. The following example illustrates a cash flow statement drawn up over a period of three months: *When car payments are finished; cash flow increases. **Entertainment increases due to family holidays and miscellaneous costs are less for the month. - 6.5 Insurance Situation of the Client \u00b6 The next step in the agent\u2019s assessment of the client, is to assess the insurance coverage already in place (if any) and compare the current coverage with his client\u2019s overall needs. 6.5.1 Personal and/or group coverage in place \u00b6 A&S insurance is available in many forms such as individual policies, group insurance coverage and protection associated with debt, etc. The agent should know the client\u2019s current type and amount of coverage as well as the character of the client\u2019s coverage. 6.5.1.1 Type of policy/policies \u00b6 Insurance in place will be provided by various sources, such as the following: Individual personally-owned, lender-owned and corporately-owned policies; and Group insurance from an employer or another group plan (i.e., an association group). An employer\u2019s group plan could terminate without rights of conversion when the plan member leaves the employ of the employer, association coverage will not. Depending on the source of the coverage there may be inherent limitations on the coverage provided. Benefits range from: Monthly income as provided by a disability income insurance policy; Monthly reimbursement as provided by a business overhead policy; A lump sum for disability buyout; Reimbursement of costs for extended medical; A lump sum for critical illness; Monthly payment for long-term care. 6.5.1.2 Characteristics of coverage \u00b6 The agent should list each form of coverage for the client and its characteristics, such as benefits, duration of benefits, tax status, definition of disability and when coverage terminates. Comparing all characteristics will show the current and future needs for insurance. 6.5.1.3 Cost of coverage \u00b6 The cost of coverage will vary by type of policy\u2014for example, a group benefit will cost less than individual coverage. A client should not duplicate coverage if it causes benefits to exceed the all\u00ac-sources maximum. Financial resources should be directed to the most critical need first. 6.5.2 Government coverage \u00b6 In Canada, the federal and provincial governments have multiple benefit programs in place for participants who cannot work due to injury or illness. The following discussion provides an overview of the benefits available from these various government-sponsored plans. It is important for agents to stay up-to-date on the current contribution and benefit levels as well as eligibility requirements. Note that the features of government plans may be updated on a regular basis. 6.5.2.1 Employment Insurance (EI) \u00b6 Employment Insurance (EI), formerly known as Unemployment Insurance (UI), is provided by the federal government that offers temporary financial assistance to unemployed workers. This assistance includes providing sickness benefits to people unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine. To qualify for EI sickness benefits the employee must: Have worked at least 600 hours in the previous 52 weeks; Have lost at least 40% of their income due to sickness, injury or quarantine. Benefits begin on the 8 th day of disability after a one-week waiting period and are payable for a maximum of 15 weeks. Thus, EI benefits will not likely be a major portion of most clients\u2019 disability program. EI is a second payor to other sources of disability benefits (such as group insurance, CPP, workers\u2019 compensation) except personally owned policies. For example, if a benefit is paid by a group plan equal to the EI benefit, nothing is received from EI. EI contributions are based on the employee\u2019s eligible income and are made by the employee and employer. Self-employed individuals pay 100% of the contribution. Employers can deduct contributions from tax. Benefits are taxable income. 6.5.2.2 Canada Pension Plan (CPP)/Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP) \u00b6 The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP) offer disability benefits to plan members under the age of 65. The CPP is a contributory plan provided by the federal government to those younger than 65 who have made a CPP contribution. The QPP replaces CPP in Qu\u00e9bec: Disability must be severe and prolonged to receive the benefit: A severe disability prevents work in any capacity; A prolonged disability is long term and usually results in death; Both conditions must exist. Contributions are based on qualifying income and are made by an employee and an employer with a 50/50 shared contribution. Self-employed workers pay 100% of the contribution. When the payment of disability benefits is approved, the benefits are payable for each month, commencing with the fourth following month in which the plan member became disabled. Benefits are payable until: Recovery of the disabled plan member; Disabled plan member reaches age 65; or Death of the plan member. Employers can deduct contributions from tax. Benefits are taxable income. At 65 the disability pension transitions to the retirement pension. The CPP and QPP determine a maximum for both the disability benefit and retirement benefit. 6.5.2.3 Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00b6 Funded by employers for their employees. Administered provincially; benefits vary by province. Benefit received is typically 80% to 90% of pre-disability net income. Employers can deduct contributions from tax. Benefits are tax-free. 6.5.2.4 Tax treatment of contributions paid and benefits received under government programs \u00b6 The tax treatment of contributions paid and benefits received under the three public insurance and pension plans varies by type of plan and with who is the payor of the contributions. Tables 6.1 and 6.2 provide a brief summary of the tax rules. Table 6.1 Taxation of contributions paid for government programs Table 6.2 Taxation of benefits received from government programs The recommendation is finalized based on personal needs, client financial situation, and existing insurance coverage. The analysis of existing insurance coverage will show: Coverage meets needs; Coverage exceeds needs; Any overlap in coverage between sources; Coverage is inadequate for needs: Benefits may be inadequate; Waiting periods may be too long; Benefit periods are not long enough; Unsuitable restrictions.

Married individuals must take into account any financial obligation they have to their spouse and dependent children. This obligation may be reduced by the income earned by the spouse. There may also be support obligations for a former spouse and children. A single person incurs the risk that comes with being alone: no one to provide care during disability, critical illness, or old age. A single person may need money to buy services that a married person might receive from a spouse. Example 1 Henri is single and earns $60,000 a year and would require 60% of his current income to survive during a period of prolonged disability.

An agent has a duty of care to develop recommendations that are suitable to the client\u2019s needs and to present the recommendations in a way that ensures the client understands the nature of the problems, and the solutions offered, so the client is able to make an informed decision. An insurance recommendation is based on: The underlying reason that has been identified for insurance; How premiums can be managed; Whether there are modifications imposed for non-standard risks; The quotes for the insurance documenting the recommendation; A review of available policies; Whether the recommendation requires revision based on client feedback; The recommendation and all supporting information should be filed in the client\u2019s documentation file\u2014an important resource for answers in the future. 7.1.1 Basis for the recommendation \u00b6 Using the client profile, the agent identifies opportunities for an insurance recommendation. Existing policies should be reviewed first to see whether changes could be made that will bring them in line with identified needs. Failing that new policies are recommended. 7.1.2 Recommendations to manage premiums \u00b6 A&S premiums are often higher than clients expect. Creative thinking may be required to bring premium costs down in order to secure a client\u2019s commitment to purchase. 7.1.2.1 Extending waiting period, shortening benefit period, reduced benefits \u00b6 The premium can be reduced by: A longer waiting period; A shorter benefit period; A lower benefit. Insurance Recommendation, Contract and Service Needs Care must be taken while increasing the waiting period or shortening the benefit period to ensure that the new extended waiting period will still allow the client to manage till the benefits begin, or that the shortened benefit period would meet the client\u2019s needs considering the uncertainty of the duration of a disability or a need for care. Usually, the option of reducing benefit is a \u201clast resort\u201d solution. 7.1.3 Head office modifications for non-standard risks \u00b6 Risk of the insured will be classified by the underwriting process as: Standard; Non-standard; Uninsurable. Non-standard risks can become insurable if: Exclusions are imposed; For example, a disability claim arising from skydiving will be excluded. Limitations are imposed; For example, the benefit period of the policy is limited to five years instead of the 10 that was applied for. The premium is rated (that is, increased); A deductible is applied to claims. For example, an extended health plan could be offered with an annual deductible. Usually, the client gets to know of these specific changes to the policy as applied for when the policy is issued. The agent must explain these changes during the delivery of the policy. 7.1.3.1 Suggesting exclusions, limitations and ratings \u00b6 Exclusions and limitations are both elements that the insurance company might integrate into the contract being offered to the client to limit the insurer\u2019s otherwise excess risk exposure with a non-standard life. A rating is simply applying a premium to the contract that is higher than would be warranted if the applicant was rated \u201cstandard\u201d. The higher premium allows the insurer to build up a higher reserve\u2014to help offset the higher risk of having to pay benefits. 7.1.3.2 Suggesting deductibles \u00b6 An alternative, or complement, to modifying the benefits available under the plan is to require the insured to share in the cost of the covered treatments or benefits otherwise payable by imposing a deductible (i.e., an amount of the claim that must be paid by the insured before any benefits are forthcoming from the insurance company). Deductibles would be most common in extended health plans: plans which would normally require the insurer to pay, or reimburse the insured for, covered goods or services. Instead of being covered for the first dollar of claims, the insured is required to cover a dollar amount of the covered items himself, usually with a new deductible being applied each coverage year. In this way, the insurance company\u2019s exposure to payouts is somewhat reduced. Example Elvira\u2019s group extended health insurance plan offers coverage of up to $2,500 a year for preventative and restorative dental services, after allowing for a $200 annual deductible per calendar year. Elvira\u2019s first claim this year was $300, for X-rays, cleaning and one filling. She had to pay the first $200 herself, under the deductible and was reimbursed the additional $100. For any subsequent dental claims during the same calendar year, no deductible would apply. 7.1.4 Providing quotes \u00b6 Quotes can be presented to the client for: A single \u201cbest choice\u201d product solution: The agent researches the market and makes product comparisons in order to determine the best product solution in line with the client\u2019s needs. He then presents this best option to the client based on his research. The agent should maintain a record of his research and the reasons behind his final decision. The recommendation, in this case, is final and the client decides whether to accept the recommendation or not. Two suitable but different solutions: The client is involved in the decision-making process based on the agent\u2019s preliminary research. The agent\u2019s role will be to compare competing product similarities and differences. Which route to take is a matter of personal choice of the agent but the agent who offers complimentary choices must prepare a clear comparison that highlights the main points of each policy. The agent should focus on the similarities and differences between the policies when making his comparison. Trying to compare more than a few basic points may lead to the client not being able to make a decision. The agent can help him make an informed decision between the policies being considered once the applicant has a clear understanding of the elements of each contract. 7.1.5 Documenting the recommendation \u00b6 A client file should be opened from the very first contact between agent and client. All conversations and correspondence, both written and verbal, should be recorded in the file. Research about competing products should also go into the file. This is evidence that the agent has carried out his or her due diligence. 7.1.5.1 Rationale for recommendation \u00b6 Client expectations must be noted along with the rationale for the recommendation that was made and for those not made. It may be essential at a future date to be reminded of the reasons a specific course of action was not taken. For example: \u201cThe reason we did not proceed with the critical illness policy was the client\u2019s expressed desire not to buy the CI policy but to acquire more life insurance.\u201d Example Agent Horst had to defend himself against a client complaint after another agent had reviewed the product that Horst had recommended, suggesting that Horst had not done due diligence in his research and therefore had not made the \u201cbest\u201d recommendation for his client. Example (Cont.) In fact, Horst had compared five similar products that could meet his client\u2019s needs and recommended the one that he felt was the best fit. Horst had wisely kept copies of his product research and a grid that he created to compare the products from a variety of perspectives. These documents proved invaluable in defending the fact that he did his due diligence and made a valid recommendation. 7.1.5.2 Client expectations \u00b6 A client\u2019s expectations about his or her insurability may not match with the underwriters\u2019 assessment of the client\u2019s insurability. The opinions expressed by clients may lead to expectations about: The insurance product and coverage details they think is most suitable; The risk they present; The premium they deserve. The client file should document these expectations and how the agent took them into consideration. If a policy is delivered that is significantly different than the client\u2019s expectation, the agent may want the client to sign a waiver acknowledging the difference. 7.1.6 Presenting complementary policies \u00b6 Because insurance products address specific needs, it is quite possible for a client to require more than one type of policy. For example, a client may need a disability income policy plus a long-term-care policy. If it is not possible to proceed with the recommendation for multiple policies, the most-pressing need should be addressed first. Example Elijah owns a computer software consulting firm with three employees: two part-time employees and one full-time employee named Malik. Malik\u2019s services are critical to the success of the business. If this key employee was to die or become disabled for a lengthy period of time, business revenues would suffer significantly, perhaps to the point where the business would have to be wound up. At the same time, Malik has a wife and two children who are wholly reliant on him for their financial support. Elijah feels that the business could survive for at least 6 months without Malik\u2019s contribution, but his family would be in serious financial straits after only 60 days. The business would need replacement cash flow of $10,000 a month for up to 2 years whereas the family would need $3,000 a month for at least 5 years if the disability lasted that long. It would appear that one disability contract would not meet the needs of both the business and the family, so Elijah\u2019s agent recommended that the company take out two policies: a key person disability contract for $10,000 a month with a 180-day waiting period, payable to Elijah\u2019s company, and a disability policy for $3,000 a month with a 60-day waiting period, payable to Malik. 7.1.7 Revising the recommendation \u00b6 If an initial recommendation is unsuitable, the agent must find ways to revise the recommendation to make it acceptable to the client, while ensuring that it meets the client\u2019s coverage needs as closely as possible. 7.2 Application for Insurance \u00b6 The application is the first step in the process of creating an insurance contract. Contracts are subject to contract law and imply a set of rights and obligations on all parties to the contract. A copy of the application should be placed in the documentation file. 7.2.1 Attention to detail required \u00b6 The application requires thorough and accurate answers to all questions, as underwriting of the application is generally based upon the answers provided. The agent must ask the applicant all questions on the application form, and record the client\u2019s answers completely and accurately. Inaccurate or incomplete information on the application could result in a delayed underwriting process or coverage being declined. From a practical and legal standpoint, the applicant and insured rely on the agent\u2019s expertise in regard to the interpretation of the questions being asked on the application and an explanation of the nature of the answers expected. How does the agent show the necessary attention to detail in the application? The agent correctly specifies the type of insurance and its coverage; The agent ensures the correct parties (i.e., the policyholder, life insured, and beneficiary) are properly named under the policy; The agent quotes a premium to the applicant and stresses that it is preliminary and will be finalized after underwriting; The agent adds riders correctly according to the client\u2019s wishes and informs the client that underwriting for riders is separate from the base policy, and rider premiums will be in addition to the premium for the base policy. 7.2.1.1 Naming of beneficiary \u00b6 Most A&S individual policies name the same person as the policyholder, life insured, and beneficiary. Example Concerned about not burdening his children financially, Andre is applying for a long-term care policy on his own life, to cover nursing home fees and other medical costs should he need care in his elder years. Andre will be the owner, the life insured, and the beneficiary of the policy. Business policies will be different. Often the business will be the policyholder. The life insured may be a shareholder, owner, or employee. The beneficiary may be the business, a shareholder, or an owner. Ensure the correct beneficiary information is stated so that premiums will be charged and benefits will be paid as the business expects. Ensuring the beneficiary information is correct is also important for tax reasons. Example Hanif runs a privately incorporated business with three employees. He has struck different compensation arrangements with each employee and has taken out individual disability insurance policies on two of them, Alfred and Blanche, for different purposes. Example (Cont.) The policy on Alfred is a key person plan, designed to compensate the business for the loss of his services should he become disabled for a period of time. Hanif\u2019s business should be both the owner and the beneficiary of that policy. Neither the payment of premiums by the employer nor the payment of benefits (if any) to the employer would have a tax impact on the employee who is the life insured under the policy. A second policy, on the life of Blanche, is intended to replace her personal income should she become disabled, thereby relieving the business of any obligation to continue Blanche\u2019s salary even though she is not productive and contributing to business revenues. The business should be the owner of the policy. If Blanche is named as beneficiary of the policy, she should report the premiums that the business pays on the policy as a taxable employment benefit. Otherwise, the business could be named as beneficiary and use the policy benefits to replace the salary otherwise payable to a disabled Blanche. But in that case the entire benefit paid to Blanche would be taxable, not merely the premiums paid on the policy. Either outcome is acceptable, but Hanif and Blanche would need to know the tax consequences arising from the structure chosen. 7.2.2 Agent\u2019s contribution to application \u00b6 The agent should be proactive in the application process, asking for information that he knows the head office underwriting department may require, even it is not specifically requested on the application. The agent may choose to record his thoughts from the client interview. Note that the agent may be the only the insurance company representative with whom the applicant has face-to-face contact, thus, the agent\u2019s impressions and concerns are very important to the underwriting process. The agent intervenes in the following aspects of the application: Agent\u2019s comments; Medical questions; Inspection report; and Hazardous sports and occupations questionnaires. 7.2.2.1 Agent\u2019s comments \u00b6 Agents are provided with a comments section on the application for extra information that cannot be answered with yes/no responses. Comments provided by the agent may be favourable or unfavourable to the applicant. For example, during the application process, the agent may notice that the client\u2019s clothes smell like cigarette smoke but the client claims not to be a smoker, an agent should draw the insurer\u2019s attention to it. Continuous exposure to second-hand smoke may have a lasting negative effect on a proposed insured\u2019s health, which could also impact premiums. It is essential for the agent to reveal any additional information that affects underwriting and acceptance or denial of the application. 7.2.2.2 Medical questions \u00b6 The agent assists the applicant with the completion of the \u201cnon-medical\u201d form: a questionnaire that requires the applicant to respond to a series of questions about his and his family\u2019s health history, either in lieu of or as a precursor to undergoing a medical examination. Medical questions can prompt the agent to ask for extra details. For example, a medical check-up could be scheduled (i.e., routine) or unscheduled (i.e., due to a medical problem) and could result in tests, medical procedures, drugs or therapy. Simply knowing there was a medical check-up does not provide the full and accurate picture of the reasons for the check-up and its outcome. Example A question on the non-medical form on an application asks, \u201cWhen was the last time you visited a doctor, and what was the reason for the visit?\u201d The applicant, who was also to be the life insured under the policy, answered, \u201cLast July, for a check-up.\u201d The agent recorded the applicant\u2019s answer and moved on to the next question. However, this left a number of unanswered questions in the mind of the head office underwriter: Was this an annual or semi-annual scheduled check-up or was there a specific problem that triggered the visit to the doctor? If the latter, what was the specific problem? What were the symptoms, if any? What did the doctor conclude? Were you subsequently sent for tests? If so, which tests? What feedback did you or your doctor receive? Was any medical procedure required? Were any drugs or therapies prescribed? What was the result of the treatment, if any? An answer simply recording the date of the applicant\u2019s last doctor visit might have satisfied the needs of the question, in its simplest form, but would not have satisfied the underwriters. 7.2.2.3 Inspection report \u00b6 An Inspection Report is ordered by the underwriter from a third party (e.g. input from the applicant\u2019s employer, neighbour, etc.). It is used to provide details on lifestyle issues\u2014such as participation in dangerous sports. 7.2.2.4 Hazardous sports and occupations questionnaires \u00b6 If the applicant admits to participation in hazardous sports or works in a dangerous occupation, a separate questionnaire at the time of the application must be completed asking for details of the activity and how often the applicant currently engages in the activity and plans to in the future. The underwriter can choose to manage the risk with an exclusion rider or by denying the policy. 7.2.3 Necessary documents and procedures \u00b6 Health information and confirmation of income must be provided for individual disability insurance. Almost all types of insurance require the applicant to provide documentation in support of health, income or insurance needs, and perhaps to undergo special medical procedures. All types of business insurance also have similar requirements for documentation. Extended health care relies primarily on the health questionnaire. 7.2.3.1 Medical exam \u00b6 Medical evidence of insurability may be provided by medical tests and/or an examination as part of the underwriting process. It will be required when: Coverage exceeds a certain limit; The life insured has attained a specified age; Medical history reveals a medical condition. Example In completing the non-med questionnaire on an application for long-term care insurance, Jorge disclosed the fact that he had a \u201cminor\u201d heart attack four years ago. In order to determine the extent of the damage to his heart muscle, the insurance company asked for an Attending Physician\u2019s Report and a doctor\u2019s medical with a stress test. 7.2.3.2 Confirmation of income \u00b6 When the purpose of the insurance is income replacement (for instance, through a disability income insurance policy), income amounts and sources must be verified by: Income questions on the questionnaire; Copies of personal income tax returns and the Canada Revenue Agency Notice of Assessment; T-4s issued by an employer and T-5s issued for investment income. Businesses must provide financial statements for, at least, the preceding three years. 7.2.3.3 Replacing existing coverage \u00b6 If a new A&S policy is proposed to replace an existing A&S policy, the agent must ensure the replacement is in the best interests of the client. The agent will be required to do a thorough comparison of many policy features and benefits. These include the premium, coverage, exclusions, riders, expiry date, waiting periods, and benefit period. For critical illness insurance, the definitions for what is conventionally referred to as the \u201cbig four\u201d covered conditions (i.e., heart attack, cancer, stroke and coronary artery bypass surgery), and any other medical conditions insured by the policy, should be reviewed in depth. 7.3 Underwriting by Insurer \u00b6 Underwriting assesses the applicant\u2019s: Financial underwriting as shown by income; Medical underwriting as shown by health. 7.3.1 Factors affecting premiums \u00b6 Insurance companies consider several different factors when pricing disability and other A&S products. Note that the extent to which the insurance companies can control the prices varies. The considerations outlined below impact premiums are set by insurers: 7.3.1.1 Morbidity rates \u00b6 Morbidity is the instance of disability\u2014injury or illness\u2014in the population at large. The morbidity rate is the likelihood that a person, according to age, gender, occupation or some other factor, will suffer from a disease, illness, injury, or sickness. The mortality rate, in contrast to the morbidity rate, is the rate of death. As noted, morbidity tables are used by actuaries to estimate future claims as accurately possible. Actual numbers of claimants may vary \u2013 greater or less than estimated \u2013 with the potential variance becoming more severe if the mix of lives insured by the insurance company varies significantly from the mix of lives in the population as a whole. The tables only show the number of past claims, their causes and their duration: not the dollar amount of exposure per claim. Some insurers are more successful estimating morbidity rates than others, and consequently, their premiums reflect their accuracy. This may mean their premiums are higher or lower than competitors. 7.3.1.2 Ratings and exclusions \u00b6 As noted previously, ratings and exclusions are a way for the insurance company to manage the risk of a claim. 7.3.2 Financial underwriting \u00b6 Coverage that insurers will issue is restricted to a percentage of pre-disability income from all sources and is coordinated with benefits available from all other sources. The applicant must be a good candidate for premium payments after issue and into the future. This requires verification of the applicant\u2019s income and expenses. The life insurance company can lose money on a policy that is issued and lapses within several years. 7.3.3 Medical underwriting \u00b6 When medically underwriting a client and assessing the risk of whether to insure a given applicant, insurance companies evaluate the health of an applicant through: Performing a medical examination by a doctor or a paramedical professional; and Often (but not automatically) asking for supplementary reports from the applicant\u2019s personal physician as well as input from the Medical Information Bureau (MIB). 7.3.3.1 Attending Physician\u2019s Statement (APS) \u00b6 An Attending Physician\u2019s Statement (APS) is a report from the applicant\u2019s doctor, outlining details of a condition or treatment incurred in the past. The personal physician of the life insured provides the APS. It is requested by the underwriter, and the insurance company pays for the statement. The need for an APS is determined by: The applicant\u2019s age; The policy coverage; Medical history of the applicant or their family. Additionally, the insurer may request additional information or tests, such as a medical exam by a paramedic or physician, blood or urine tests, or an electrocardiogram. 7.3.3.2 Medical Information Bureau (MIB) \u00b6 The Medical Information Bureau (MIB) is an organization serving the life and health insurance industry by compiling historical data on lives insured and those applying for insurance. The insurer reports coded information to the MIB when an individual applies for insurance and also seeks such coded information currently on file with the MIB. An applicant must give permission for their information to be shared with the MIB. The information shared with the MIB provides general \u201cmarkers\u201d that indicate a possible health problem and could trigger the insurer to seek additional input from medical professionals. The MIB may also collect information about coverage currently in force, or currently being applied for, and instances where coverage was declined on an applicant. With this information, insurance companies can protect themselves against applicants seeking: To \u201cover-insure\u201d themselves; To obtain coverage to which they are not entitled (due to medical conditions not disclosed to the insurer). This prevents applicants who have been turned down or rated by one insurance company from applying to a second insurer without disclosing either the decline/rating or the reason for it. MIB data can lead to an underwriter requesting substantiating information from a doctor or other sources; the data itself cannot be the reason to deny a claim or apply a higher (rated) premium. 7.4 Insurance Contract \u00b6 The issue of the contract by the insurance company to the applicant is the second step in the process of preparing a contract: The policy is an \u201coffer\u201d that requires acceptance by the applicant; The contract is completed when the policy is accepted and the policy premium is paid; The contract is the basis for all transactions between the policyholder and the insurance company. 7.4.1 Need for prompt delivery \u00b6 It may take many weeks for the policy to be underwritten and issued by the insurance company. Once issued, the agent is expected to promptly deliver the contract in person to the applicant. From the day of delivery, the policyholder has 10 days in which to review the policy and decide whether to keep it. If it is returned\u2014or rescinded\u2014by the policyholder, they will receive a full refund of their premium paid. If the insured receives her policy on Friday, June 10, she has until Friday, June 24 to return or rescind her policy because the weekends are not considered working days. 7.4.2 Need for agent awareness of change since the signature of the application \u00b6 The provincial insurance acts have specific requirements that must be met before a contract of life or A&S insurance is legally in force, such as the following: The insurance contract is delivered to the policyholder; The initial premium payment is made; and That no changes to the financial situation of the insured and the health of the life insured between application and delivery. The agent must ask the insured if there has been a change before handing over the policy. If the answer is \u201cyes\u201d the policy must not be delivered. The change should be noted on the contract, and the contract must then be returned to the insurance company. Example Agent Todd was delivering a newly issued critical illness policy to Lucille. In response to questions asked by Todd in the delivery interview, Lucille acknowledged that she had experienced chest pains, diagnosed as angina, starting about two weeks after she had submitted her application for insurance. Rather than deliver the contract to Lucille, Todd took particulars of Lucille\u2019s change in health (dates, the diagnosis, name of the doctor involved, etc.) and forwarded a copy of his notes, with his report and the contract, to the insurance company for a reassessment. 7.4.2.1 Dealing with rated cases \u00b6 A rated policy (i.e., increased premiums, exclusions, reduced benefits, etc.) will likely not meet the applicant\u2019s expectations. This disappointment can lead to the policy being rescinded. To avoid rescission, the agent should: Mention the possibility of a rating if medical or other issues arise during the application process; Point out when the rating is temporary and can be eliminated when circumstances improve; Point out gently that the rationale for applying for the coverage has not changed and indirectly imply that the need for coverage is now greater since additional risk factors have been found. 7.4.3 Providing contract disclosure \u00b6 The agent is the insurance expert; the client requires the agent\u2019s expertise to fully understand the policy with regard to its: Benefits; Riders; Key definitions of covered coverage (particularly in regard to CI insurance); Exclusions. Particular attention should be paid to exclusions and definitions to minimize conflict between the insured and the insurer at the time of the claim. 7.4.3.1 Factors that limit coverage (statutory provisions) \u00b6 Regardless of how many policies an insured may own, coverage will be limited to the following: Benefits from one contract cannot duplicate those from another; Disability coverage from all sources to a prescribed maximum of pre disability income from all sources; Provisions outlining the priority of payor; CI policies have no specific limits on the amount of benefit; Long-term care insurance to actual expenses (up to the maximum). Example Jorge has disability insurance coverage through his group plan at work that will pay him benefits of up to $2,500 a month (50% of salary) for up to 2 years after a 30-day waiting period. If he wants more comprehensive coverage than that, he could, for example, take out an individual policy that would top up his coverage by another $500 a month (totalling 60% of salary) for 2 years and then increase to $3,000 a month for an additional 3 years. This would give him $3,000 a month of coverage for the full 5 years through the 2 plans combined. He could not, however, collect more than $3,000 a month from the 2 policies combined. 7.4.3.2 Tax treatment of premiums and benefits \u00b6 The agent should not provide tax-specific information that is beyond his or her area of expertise. A client seeking tax advice should be referred to a tax specialist such as a tax lawyer. 7.4.4 Policy feature opportunities \u00b6 Opportunities for sales may arise when the insured takes advantage of the following contractual features: The future purchase option (FPO) rider; The insured may need coverage greater than the FPO provides. This can be addressed by taking out a new policy. Conversion options; Used when a group plan member converts the group coverage to an individual policy. Must occur within the 30 days following departure from the group plan. Elimination of ratings or exclusions. The removal of a rating or exclusion is an opportunity to review overall coverage. Example Two years ago Consuela purchased $2,500 a month of disability insurance coverage. The coverage was based on her income of $90,000 a year. At the time, she could have qualified for up to $4,500 a month of benefits, but some extraordinary personal expenses limited the funds that she had available for insurance. The policy she purchased has a future purchase option for up to $500 a month of additional coverage, without medical underwriting, provided she qualifies financially for the additional coverage. The first option to increase coverage comes up later this month. Consuela met with her agent and confirmed that she would like the extra coverage; in fact, her cash flow would permit her to afford $4,000 a month of insurance benefit now. Consequently, she agreed to exercise the $500 option and to apply for an additional $1,000 of coverage with full underwriting. 7.5 Policy Claims \u00b6 The claims process is a very important part of the application process to the policyholder. The claim\u2019s timing and content by the insured will be crucial to its success and credibility. It is very important for clients to ensure that all the information they write down on the claim form is complete, accurate and entirely truthful. Note that careless or false statements could lead to the insurer carrying out a lengthy adjudication process. During the claims process and when assisting the client (for example, when helping the client fill out his claims form), it is important for the agent not to put himself in the position of a conflict of interest\u2014as a representative of both the insurer and the insured. The agent should be careful to follow the carrier\u2019s procedures if he assists the clients in the claims process, particularly when helping the client with the completion of his claims form. This is a delicate legal matter. 7.5.1 requirements for a claim \u00b6 How is a claim made? The insurance company is notified of the injury, illness, or diagnosis as soon as possible following the event. The claims form is delivered to the disabled client by the agent or by mail. The claims form is completed by the disabled client. It is sent to the insurance company with original receipts or other supporting information. The insurance company seeks additional information, such as an attending physician\u2019s statement, about the medical condition causing the claim. The insurance company pays the claim in full or part or denies the claim. Standard contract limitations will apply and cause the claim to be denied, for instance if the injury is self-inflicted. Material misrepresentation on the application will result in the claim being denied. The income of the insured could reduce the claim if they earn less at the time of disability than when the application was made. 7.5.1.1 Receipts \u00b6 If benefits being applied for require reimbursement for medical or other services already rendered (such as dental work, chiropractic care, prescription drugs, etc.), the insurance company will want original copies of receipts for the expenditures, in order to verify both the amount and appropriateness of the claim. These receipts should be forwarded by the claimant to the insurance company along with the appropriate claims form. 7.5.1.2 Medical proof of diagnosis or treatment \u00b6 All types of accident and sickness contracts require the occurrence of some medical event prior to the payment of benefits. For instance: Disability policies require an inability to work and earn an income due to injury or illness; Critical illness policies require that the life insured suffer a covered condition or medical event (heart attack, stroke, etc.) triggering a claim; Long-term care policies pay benefits based on covered expenses for an insured unable to fulfill at least two of the activities of daily living (ADLs); Business overhead expense contracts require an inability to work and contribute to the business\u2019s productivity on the part of the life insured, due to injury or illness; and Extended health policies may require an assessment of medical treatment (such as extensive restorative or cosmetic dental procedures) before expenditures are authorized for reimbursement. The insurer will not, of course, simply take the insured\u2019s word for the fact that he is suffering a disability, etc., it is going to want supporting medical evidence for the diagnosis. This will, at a minimum, require a report from the attending physician regarding the nature, degree and prognosis of the event that triggered the claim. In some cases, the insurer may also request additional tests or a physical examination by a physician of their choice, to verify the condition. In addition, particularly in the case of disability, the insurance company may also want ongoing proof of treatment to rectify the situation. This again would require reports from the physician or other practitioner (chiropractor, physiotherapist, etc.) treating the claimant. 7.5.1.3 Review factors that reduce benefits \u00b6 It may be that, at the time of the claim, the client receives benefits less than the maximum provided for under the contract, or no benefits at all. It is important that the agent assists the client to understand any such discrepancies. Possible reasons for a modification of benefits payable would include situations related to standard contract limitations seen in previous chapters (such as suicide, alcohol or drug abuse, criminal activity, etc.). Similarly, all contracts provide that benefits are not payable if it is determined that the applicant made a material misrepresentation at the time of application. Furthermore, in cases where financial underwriting is required to determine the amount of benefits payable, reduced benefits may result from a change in the insured\u2019s financial situation. For example, disability benefits could be reduced if the insured\u2019s income at time of claim is less than was reported at the time of application. 7.6 Client Service \u00b6 Due to the ample competition in the marketplace, there are many companies and agents that can provide the product solution that the client needs. Good service is what makes the difference. The client communicates primarily with the agent, placing the agent at the forefront of the service relationship. Offering efficient and prompt service to the client is an important part of a long-standing successful relationship between the client, the agent and the insurance company. 7.6.1 Agent\u2019s service role \u00b6 An insurance agent\u2019s first role is to recommend solutions to meet clients\u2019 needs. An agent also has a role in servicing a client once a policy is in force. The agent\u2019s service role includes: Providing claim forms and other relevant documents; Being prompt and accurate; Developing a strategy for ongoing awareness of client situation and needs; Determining suitability of recommendations and/or the need for change; Documenting services provided; Staying in touch with the client on an annual or semi-annual basis. 7.6.1.1 Providing claim forms and other relevant documents \u00b6 The agent provides service when changes are required to the policy such as a change of address or beneficiary, electing an option (such as a future purchase option), or filing a claim. The agent may provide claim forms and other documents and, except perhaps for the claim form, they may assist the client to complete the forms and forward them to the insurer. A note with respect to services provided should go into the documentation file. 7.6.1.2 Importance of promptness and accuracy \u00b6 Promptness at the time of application is essential to ensure the applicant does not experience injury or illness that would prevent the application from being made. As previously noted, accuracy and thoroughness are essential at the time of application and policy delivery. All policy changes must be handled promptly. 7.6.1.3 Strategy for ongoing awareness of client situation and needs \u00b6 Agents should seek annual reviews with policyholders to keep on top of possible changes and opportunities. Policyholders must be encouraged to share information that could impact the policy with the agent. Example Agent Seng stresses with his disability insurance clients that they must contact him immediately if there is a significant change in their employment status: change of income level (up or down), change of employer, change of duties, or should they become unemployed. All such information should be copied and placed in the documentation file. 7.6.1.4 Documenting services provided \u00b6 As previously noted, documentation is critical for all actions taken by the agent in respect of each client. The documentation file provides an essential record that can protect the interests of the agent and the insurance company.","title":"Chapter 7 Insurance Recommendation Contract and Service Needs"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_7_Insurance_Recommendation_Contract_and_Service_Needs/#chapter-7-insurance-recommendation-contract-and-service-needs","text":"","title":"Chapter 7: Insurance Recommendation, Contract and Service Needs"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_7_Insurance_Recommendation_Contract_and_Service_Needs/#71-insurance-recommendation","text":"The following steps come after fact finding (as described in Chapter 6).

The premium is rated (that is, increased); A deductible is applied to claims. For example, an extended health plan could be offered with an annual deductible.

Deductibles would be most common in extended health plans: plans which would normally require the insurer to pay, or reimburse the insured for, covered goods or services. Instead of being covered for the first dollar of claims, the insured is required to cover a dollar amount of the covered items himself, usually with a new deductible being applied each coverage year. In this way, the insurance company\u2019s exposure to payouts is somewhat reduced. Example Elvira\u2019s group extended health insurance plan offers coverage of up to $2,500 a year for preventative and restorative dental services, after allowing for a $200 annual deductible per calendar year. Elvira\u2019s first claim this year was $300, for X-rays, cleaning and one filling. She had to pay the first $200 herself, under the deductible and was reimbursed the additional $100.

Example Elijah owns a computer software consulting firm with three employees: two part-time employees and one full-time employee named Malik. Malik\u2019s services are critical to the success of the business. If this key employee was to die or become disabled for a lengthy period of time, business revenues would suffer significantly, perhaps to the point where the business would have to be wound up. At the same time, Malik has a wife and two children who are wholly reliant on him for their financial support. Elijah feels that the business could survive for at least 6 months without Malik\u2019s contribution, but his family would be in serious financial straits after only 60 days. The business would need replacement cash flow of $10,000 a month for up to 2 years whereas the family would need $3,000 a month for at least 5 years if the disability lasted that long. It would appear that one disability contract would not meet the needs of both the business and the family, so Elijah\u2019s agent recommended that the company take out two policies: a key person disability contract for $10,000 a month with a 180-day waiting period, payable to Elijah\u2019s company, and a disability policy for $3,000 a month with a 60-day waiting period, payable to Malik.","title":"7.1.6 Presenting complementary policies"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_7_Insurance_Recommendation_Contract_and_Service_Needs/#717-revising-the-recommendation","text":"If an initial recommendation is unsuitable, the agent must find ways to revise the recommendation to make it acceptable to the client, while ensuring that it meets the client\u2019s coverage needs as closely as possible.","title":"7.1.7 Revising the recommendation"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_7_Insurance_Recommendation_Contract_and_Service_Needs/#72-application-for-insurance","text":"The application is the first step in the process of creating an insurance contract.

Example Concerned about not burdening his children financially, Andre is applying for a long-term care policy on his own life, to cover nursing home fees and other medical costs should he need care in his elder years. Andre will be the owner, the life insured, and the beneficiary of the policy. Business policies will be different. Often the business will be the policyholder. The life insured may be a shareholder, owner, or employee. The beneficiary may be the business, a shareholder, or an owner. Ensure the correct beneficiary information is stated so that premiums will be charged and benefits will be paid as the business expects. Ensuring the beneficiary information is correct is also important for tax reasons. Example Hanif runs a privately incorporated business with three employees. He has struck different compensation arrangements with each employee and has taken out individual disability insurance policies on two of them, Alfred and Blanche, for different purposes. Example (Cont.) The policy on Alfred is a key person plan, designed to compensate the business for the loss of his services should he become disabled for a period of time. Hanif\u2019s business should be both the owner and the beneficiary of that policy. Neither the payment of premiums by the employer nor the payment of benefits (if any) to the employer would have a tax impact on the employee who is the life insured under the policy. A second policy, on the life of Blanche, is intended to replace her personal income should she become disabled, thereby relieving the business of any obligation to continue Blanche\u2019s salary even though she is not productive and contributing to business revenues. The business should be the owner of the policy. If Blanche is named as beneficiary of the policy, she should report the premiums that the business pays on the policy as a taxable employment benefit. Otherwise, the business could be named as beneficiary and use the policy benefits to replace the salary otherwise payable to a disabled Blanche.

Group plan pricing is determined by: General actuarial statistics; and Previous claims (when available) Therefore, the insurance company must consider: The group\u2019s makeup; The business\u2019s nature; Comparative businesses. The employee data sheet contains some of the required information on members as well as the group itself (discussed later in this Section). 8.1.1 Makeup of the group \u00b6 Groups are underwritten based on the character and makeup of the group. The multiple identities of the group establish the coverage and premium of group members since they are not typically underwritten medically or financially (as is done with individual policies). Thus, while dealing with groups, the insurer will deal with factors such as size (number of members), average age, gender and turnover rate. 8.1.1.1 Number of members \u00b6 The number of members in the group influences the insurance company\u2019s ability to estimate future claims and, therefore, to efficiently price premiums. Risk is more easily assimilated into large groups opposed to small groups. In a large group, say with thousands of members, the \u201claw of large numbers\u201d is likely to work and the claims of the group are likely to be as per actuarial norms or historical experience because the risk is spread over a much wider range. Therefore, the premiums for large groups can be more accurately determined. For small groups, with 25 lives or fewer members, for example, the claims of the group cannot be expected to keep in line with actuarial norms. Thus, smaller groups are often pooled with experience of similar small groups for pricing. Therefore, smaller groups are likely to have a higher premium than larger groups. 8.1.1.2 Age/Gender \u00b6 Age and gender are risk factors for different types of claims and are important in determining the premium for the group, particularly disability and long-term care. Groups with more female members face higher premiums because the claims from a primarily female group are higher for health and disability claims than a primarily male group. Groups with older members face higher premiums than groups with younger members because older members are likely to file more claims for drug and long-term care claims. 8.1.1.3 Turnover rate \u00b6 The turnover rate is the rate at which existing members leave the group and new members join. The past turnover rate is a good predictor of the future group makeup\u2014the percentage of group members likely to leave the group and be replaced by others annually. A low turnover rate is considered 5% to 10% of the group annually. A group with a high turnover rate will be penalized with higher premiums and longer waiting periods. 8.1.2 Nature of the business \u00b6 The type of business is critical to the premium cost and benefits provided by the group plan. For example, a construction business requiring hands-on activity exposes its employees to a greater physical risk than an office business where employees primarily work at their desks. Note that individuals who work in \u201cwhite collar\u201d jobs may experience longer working hours as well as more work-related stress than others. These occupations may lead to the risk of more claims. Low-risk occupations are rewarded with lower premiums and more attractive benefits. 8.1.3 Comparative businesses \u00b6 When a group is applying for insurance for the first time, the claims experience statistics available may be unreliable or non-existent for the group characteristics. The insurer will then look into their statistics of groups in the same or comparative business to estimate the future claims and establish benefits and premiums. 8.1.4 Employee data sheet \u00b6 The employer is required to complete an employee census report that compiles information provided by the individual group members about their: Age\u2014used to determine eligibility for certain benefits. Gender\u2014could be a significant factor in pricing. Occupational class\u2014the plan may have different benefits packages for different classifications of employees (i.e., factory workers versus executives). Dependents\u2014required if the group plan has a standard or optional coverage including the spouse/children of the plan member. Social Insurance Number\u2014required when benefits or premiums are a taxable benefit to the group member. Salary/earnings\u2014used to determine membership classes of benefits and disability income benefits. 8.2 Products and Services \u00b6 Group insurance products include: Disability income replacement: Short-term disability (STD); and Long-term disability (LTD). Extended health benefits: Prescription drugs; Vision care; Dental; Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D); Critical illness (some group plans only); Long-term care (less common than other coverages); Employee assistance plans (EAPs)\u2014some group plans only. 8.2.1 Elements of an Employee Assistance Plan (EAP) \u00b6 Many employers provide an Employee Assistance Plan (EAP) to employees as part of the group plan to offer counselling services outside more traditional benefits like disability and extended health services. An EAP is not insurance coverage but is instead a counselling service providing: Psychological counselling for psychological problems; Addiction counselling for drug or alcohol addiction; Marriage counselling for marital stress; Legal counselling for personal legal services including divorce, the preparation of a will, etc. An EAP is an attractive employee benefit. The addition of an EAP to a group plan is an acknowledgement that employees may have personal or work-related stress that could negatively impact their ability to do their jobs efficiently. Some employers provide on site EAP counselling services, but most employers provide services off-site through third-party providers to reduce cost as well as to reinforce the fact that the employee\u2019s use of the program is kept confidential. The benefits are in the form of consultation with a professional counsellor. The services are typically subject to annual deductibles, a co-insurance and perhaps a maximum number of hours of services per year. Example Sasha works for a large medical supply company that is in fierce competition with another major supplier. Market forces are putting a lot of financial pressure on her company and the senior executives are in turn putting a lot of pressure on their employees. As a consequence, Sasha is suffering from stress-induced stomach complaints, headaches and minor depression. Fortunately, her company has an excellent group benefits plan with an EAP. Through this program, Sasha is entitled to up to 10 hours of counselling with a psychologist, to help her develop coping strategies to deal with the pressure and avoid having to submit a stress-related disability claim. Though the statistics are uncertain, the EAP is implemented by the employer with the understanding that the EAP costs are outweighed by both the reduction in sick days as well as by the employees\u2019 increased productivity. Premiums are based on an experience rating. Experience rating is based on past claims experience for the group. Premiums are tax deductible for the employer. Benefits are not a taxable benefit to employees unless the benefits are provided for services related to: Physical or mental health of the employee or a person related to the employee; Retirement or other financial counselling; Employment placement for a terminated employee. Benefits for counselling for legal or financial matters are generally treated as a taxable benefit. 8.2.2 Group insurer\u2019s services \u00b6 The insurance company supports its plan sponsors by: Plan member enrolment; Premium billing; Claims adjudication (that is, assessment of the claim). 8.2.2.1 Plan member enrolment \u00b6 Employees complete an enrolment form to join a group. This occurs when employees join the employer-sponsor or when they have satisfied the qualification period (usually three months after starting work). This is often handled by the human resources department in larger organizations. Non-contributory plans: Enrolment is mandatory due to the predetermined benefits already in place; All benefits and costs are equal; The sign-up process is simple and typically only includes a completion of enrolment cards provided by the insurer. Contributory plans: Most group plans are contributory; 100% participation is not required (some predetermined percentage of the employees must sign up before the plan can be put into place); No need to actively solicit members to participate in the plan; Employers often provide a 30\u201360-day window for employees to sign up. The insurance company assists employees with information and assistance as needed in order to ensure that the client fully understands plan benefits and options, particularly in terms of deciding on additional coverage. Underwriting is often required when a plan member seeks out additional coverage. 8.2.2.2 Premium billing \u00b6 The insurance company sets the premium for each group and bills the sponsor for the premium on a monthly basis. Non-contributory employer/employee plans: The insurer bills the employer one amount monthly that the employer is then required to remit to the insurer. Contributory plans: The insurer bills the employer one amount monthly that the employer is then required to remit to the insurer; The insurer informs the employer of each plan member\u2019s contributory portion of the premium. That contribution is deducted directly from the payroll for each member, and the employer is required to remit the total premium to the insurer. 8.2.2.3 Claims adjudication \u00b6 The adjudication of group claims is the company\u2019s primary administrative function. This involves a series of steps when a claim is submitted: The claims form is compared to the contract to ensure the claim is contractually covered. The claim is de-nied if it is not covered in the contract. If the claim is covered by the contract, an assessment is made of the benefit: whether it qualifies to be payable as well as how much is to be paid, and to whom. The claimant may be required to provide the insurer with additional information. If the claim is approved, the insurer must make the correct payments to the insured. If the claim does not qualify for the plan benefit, it is denied. The benefit is then paid. The insurance company will observe the maximum benefit and benefit period of the contract to ensure they are not exceeded. The company will also monitor on an on-going basis wheth-er the claimant qualifies for the benefit. For example, whether the claimant satisfies the definition of disability under the terms of the contract. 8.2.3 Group brokerage services \u00b6 A group broker is used to match the needs of a group plan sponsor with insurance companies that offer group plans. The group broker\u2019s value comes from his familiarity with the marketplace. The broker gathers the required data regarding the group\u2019s makeup and past claims. The broker then discusses with the sponsor which benefits are negotiable and non-negotiable. On his client\u2019s behalf, the group broker collects quotes from different insurance companies (the group sponsor). He determines which company or companies are most in line with his client\u2019s needs and then makes a recommendation with the selected firm on behalf of the group. It is then the group broker\u2019s responsibility to act as the contact between the client and the account executive regarding the insurance company in question. 8.3 Coverage \u00b6 A group sponsor may seek a replacement for the firm providing its group insurance plan if it believes the client: Pays too much; Needs additional or more flexible benefits to be available; Has had too many claims denied and/or poor service in the past (i.e., there is a dissatisfaction with service including claim turnaround times). A group agent or broker will consider the following in shopping the market for a new plan: An in-depth analysis of the benefits offered (plan design); An evaluation of the group\u2019s claims experience; The overall level of satisfaction with the current group provider. 8.3.1 Existing coverage \u00b6 A group agent should have a clear understanding of the existing plan\u2019s coverage including any insufficiencies that it may have. Evaluation of the existing group coverage relies on three separate elements: An in-depth analysis of the benefits offered (plan design); An evaluation of the group\u2019s claims experience; Overall satisfaction level with the current group provider. 8.3.1.1 Existing plan design \u00b6 The existing plan coverage is examined to review past coverage as well as an analysis of needs should the plan sponsor wish to consider the offering of other insurers. The agent should ask: What does the existing plan provide? Why is there dissatisfaction with the plan? The answers to these questions can steer the group agent towards a provider that better meets needs. An in-depth analysis of the existing plan should include the type of coverage, the scope of coverage (covered conditions, products and services, benefit limits, definitions, deductibles and co-insurance factors, etc.) and the type of funding in place. 8.3.1.2 Claims experience \u00b6 Past claims are a major contributor in order to determine premium pricing and plan design. Premium pricing reflects the amount of claims a group makes. Therefore, a group that makes a lot of claims will typically have to pay higher premiums when the plan is renewed or when seeking out a new insurer. The plan design may be at fault for a high rate of claims if the plan offers generous benefits and maximums, and does not offset costs through the use of waiting periods, deductibles and co-insurance. Many factors need to be considered and the following questions need to be answered: Is the coverage very broad? Are the definitions of a covered event, product or service very liberal? Are benefit maximums very high? Are there deductibles, co-insurance factors and waiting periods designed to minimize claims? 8.3.1.3 Satisfaction with current provider \u00b6 Concerns about the current provider must be considered before approaching a replacement or a new carrier. 8.3.2 Proposed new coverage \u00b6 Price should not be the only determining factor for switching to a new group carrier Therefore, it is important to conduct an in-depth examination of the plan design in order to determine whether value or price is the main element of the proposed plan. 8.3.2.1 New plan design \u00b6 A true comparison must be made of each element of the existing plan against the proposal of a new provider. Simply comparing premiums is not enough. A comparison between disability plans asks: What is the definition of disability of each plan? What is the waiting period? What is the short-term disability benefit period and how much income is replaced? How about the long-term disability benefit period and income replacement? Is rehabilitation offered? Drug benefits can be an on-going drain on a plan, especially when dependents are covered. An analysis of the existing and new plan asks: What is the deductible of each? Co-insurance? What drugs are covered? Brand name or generic coverage? Pay-direct or reimbursement? The same exercise should be carried out for each product (for example, extended health, vision, dental benefits, long-term care, critical illness and EAP) that will comprise a part of the future plan. 8.3.3 Funding formulas \u00b6 The group sponsor has three choices of how to pay for the group plan: Non-refund accounting; Refund accounting; Administrative services only. 8.3.3.1 Non-refund accounting \u00b6 Non-refund accounting refers to the more traditional form of funding a group insurance plan through the use of a fully insured (pooled) plan. The insurance company assumes the complete responsibility for paying all claims. Premiums are set by insurance companies based upon the predicted periodic cost of claims; these predictions are based on past claims experience. As its name suggests, there is no refund of premiums to the sponsor when claims are less than premiums paid. Claims greater than premiums are the responsibility of the insurer. However, if claims exceed premiums, the sponsor may find premiums increase at the time of renewal. 8.3.3.2 Refund accounting \u00b6 Refund accounting is also known as the retention accounting method of funding. Premiums are based on the group\u2019s past claims experience and are set based on future anticipation of claims: A partial refund of premiums is received by the sponsor when claims are less than premiums paid; The insurance company has the opportunity to recoup its losses at the time of contract renewal when claims are more than anticipated and premiums paid. 8.3.3.3 Administrative Services Only (ASO) \u00b6 The group sponsor pays all claims when it has an Administrative Services Only (ASO) contract. The administration of the plan is handled by the insurance company. There is no insurance element to the plan as the plan sponsor is assuming all risk of paying the claims. The plan sponsor outsources the administration (record keeping, pricing, adjudicating and paying claims, etc.) to an insurance company. ASO is suitable for organizations with a very large number of employees, substantial assets and cash flow. 8.3.4 Responsibility for premium payment \u00b6 Employer/employee plans can be structured either as a contributory plan, with premiums shared between the employer and the employee, or as an employer-pay-all non-contributory plan. Group association plans are typically fully contributory: the premium is fully paid by the member. 8.3.4.1 Non-contributory \u00b6 The plan sponsor pays the premiums. It is usually a requirement that 100% of qualifying employees join the plan and there is little or no opportunity for the group members to vary their benefits from a set schedule. 8.3.4.2 Contributory \u00b6 The plan sponsor and the plan member share the premium cost. Membership in the plan is optional although a minimum number of employee members will be required to participate in the plan and there is little or no opportunity for group members to vary their benefits from a set schedule of benefits. Contributory plans offer more flexibility in selecting benefits although some base coverage may be mandatory. In a fully contributory plan, plan members pay 100% of premiums. This is the form of payment for group-association plans, such as a plan offered by a professional group to its members. 8.4 Costs \u00b6 Several factors determine the overall costs of group insurance: Premium rates; Taxation and group plan registration; Claims experience and other product cost drivers. These elements are briefly discussed in the following sections. 8.4.1 Premium rates \u00b6 Several factors affect group premium rates, such as: Makeup of the group The number of members in a group influences the insurer\u2019s ability to estimate future claims. The group members\u2019 average age, gender and turnover rate greatly influence premium pricing. Nature of the business The level of benefits offered and premium pricing under the group plan depends on the nature of the business, specifically the type and level of risk that employees are exposed to. Group benefits offered Premium pricing is directly linked to nature and the level of benefits offered - increased coverage yielding typically higher premiums. Past claims experience The carrier will want to predict future claim rates on past claims experience in order to determine the right premium. 8.4.1.1 Manual rating \u00b6 If a group is acquiring insurance for the first time, its premiums will be based on the claims experience for similar groups. This method is also called \u201cpooled\u201d pricing. 8.4.1.2 Experience rating \u00b6 When a group is renewing its plan, premiums will be based on the claims experience of the group. Here the assumption is that the group is sufficiently large for past claims experience to be statistically meaningful. 8.4.1.3 Blended rating \u00b6 The premium is set through typically blending rates from both the manual rating and experience rating. The degree to which the past claims experience influences the pricing is dependent on how credible the past experience is considered to be. 8.4.1.4 Credibility \u00b6 Credibility refers to a way of establishing how reliable experience rating is in a particular case. Credibility is the result of a low turnover and a history of group plan ownership by the sponsor. Together, they provide the best indicator of future claims and become a credibility \u201cfactor\u201d in determining the premium. A large group with a number of years of claims experience may have a high credibility. A small group with high turnover rates will have a much lower credibility. Groups with no previous coverage will have a null experience credibility rating and, as a result, premium rates would be based exclusively on a manual rating approach. Example The Master Mobile Company has a workforce of 37 employees and an annual employee turnover rate of 18%. The company has had a group benefits plan in force for four years. Their claims experience credibility has been rated at 40%, meaning that insurance premiums will be based 40% on their previous claims experience and 60% on the standard manual rate for a group of their size in a comparable industry. 8.4.2 Taxation and group plan registration \u00b6 Group A&S plans have tax implications that must be considered while determining the overall cost of the coverage for the plan sponsor and plan members. The issues to be considered are: Employee payment of long-term disability premium; Registration of short-term disability plan with Employment and Social Development Canada; Group premium tax. 8.4.2.1 Employee payment of long-term disability premium \u00b6 The tax ramifications of premiums and benefits are an important factor to consider when forming a long-term disability plan. Employer-paid premiums for group A&S products are a tax-deductible expense for employers, in spite if they are a taxable benefit for the covered employees. The taxation of disability benefits hinges on who pays the premium: Employer pays 100% of premium = taxable income for the employee; Employee pays 100% of premium = tax-free income for the employee; Employer and employee share premium = tax-free income for the employee equal to his premium contribution; balance is taxable income. Example Shawna is a member of the group insurance plan where she works, which provides her with disability benefits of $1,200 a month. Shawna and her employer share the cost of disability premiums 50/50. Since the inception of the plan each has paid $3,600 in group disability premiums and, until last year, Shawna never had a claim. She was sick last January and was off work for 10 months, receiving $9,600 in disability benefits, her first $3,600 of benefits (equal to the premiums that she had paid into the plan) were tax-free while the other $6,000 of benefits was a taxable benefit to Shawna. In most contributory group plans, the employee\u2019s portion of the group premiums paid is structured to pay 100% of the group disability premiums first. 8.4.2.2 Registration of short-term disability plan with Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) \u00b6 Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is responsible for overseeing the federal Employment Insurance (EI) program. Among the benefits provided to persons eligible for EI is a sickness benefit paid for a maximum of 15 weeks, following a one-week waiting period. An employer may reduce its EI premiums if it provides short-term disability coverage equal to or greater than the EI benefit: This is because EI is the second payor and its benefit would not be paid when the group STD plan is paying a benefit; The STD plan must be registered with ESDC for the employer to receive the partial reduction in EI premiums otherwise payable. 8.4.2.3 Group premium tax \u00b6 Part of the premium includes the provincial premium tax, typically charged at 2% to 3% of the net premium. The tax applies whether the employer or plan member pays the premiums. The tax is part of the overall premium quoted rather than being broken out as a separate charge. Example Jorge pays $150.81 per month for his group long-term disability insurance coverage. The $150.81 monthly charge represents the base premium for the coverage of $147.06 plus a 2.55% premium tax of $3.75 ( $147.06 \u00d7 2.55%). 8.4.3 Claims experience and other product cost drivers \u00b6 Anticipated claims are the basis for premiums. As noted previously, plan design can contribute to lower premiums by: Including deductibles and co-insurance; Benefits that are perceived as free to the member\u2014no deductible or co-insurance factor\u2014are more likely to be claimed. Extending the waiting period for disability; This can eliminate costs associated with short-term claims. Eliminating brand-name drugs, high-cost drugs, and non-prescription drugs from a drug benefit plan; Making a plan non-contributory. So that members do not feel a sense of entitlement to use something they paid for. 8.5 Claims Administration \u00b6 It is a group insurer\u2019s responsibility to administer claims made. What is the process for paying a claim? The claimant notifies the insurer of claims, and provides the insurer with claim forms and proof of claims (i.e., a doctor\u2019s note); The insurer verifies the plan is in force, the member is enrolled in the plan, and the requested benefit is provided by the plan; The claim is adjudicated and when approved, paid by the insurer. For large groups communication with group sponsor and members would be the responsibility of the representative of the insurer. Small groups may need the agent to communicate with plan members. 8.6 Coordination of Benefits \u00b6 The coordination of benefits (COB) is a clause in the master contract. It specifies rules for members who are covered by more than one group plan (often through family coverage via a spouse\u2019s plan) so that benefits are not duplicated. A member submits a claim first to his own plan. If it is not paid in full by his plan, it is then submitted to the second plan (usually the plan of a spouse). The second plan pays the lesser of: What it would have paid if the claim had been filed first with that plan; The sum of the total expense minus any benefits already received. Claims for dependents in all plans (children) are submitted first to the plan whose parent has a birth date earliest in the year. For example, Deena and Adam\u2019s son, Josh, goes to the dentist and the bill for his services is $440. Deena\u2019s birthday is October 12. Adam\u2019s birthday is May 2. Therefore, the claim for Josh\u2019s expenses is submitted first to Adam\u2019s plan. Example Jasmine and Abdul are a married couple, both working in the computer industry, but each for a different company. Each of them is a member of a group plan that offers benefits to employees and their spouses. The plans are provided by two different insurance companies. Both plans offer dental benefits, including restorative services, like caps and bridges. Jasmine\u2019s plan has a $100 annual deductible on dental claims and a $1,500 annual maximum on restorative services. Abdul\u2019s plan has a $50 annual deductible on dental claims and a $2,000 annual maximum on restorative services. Last year Jasmine fell while hiking and damaged her front teeth. The dentist bill for the restorative work was $2,500. It was the first dental claim against either plan for the year. As the patient in question, Jasmine claimed first against her group plan carrier. She was responsible for the first $100 of expenses, under the plan\u2019s deductible. Of the other $2,400 of expenses, her plan reimbursed her $1,500\u2014the maximum allowable in one year for restorative services. That left Jasmine with $1,000 of dental expenses that her group plan did not cover. The couple then submitted the entire $2,500 bill to Abdul\u2019s plan as well. If it had been the primary carrier, Abdul\u2019s plan would have covered $2,000 of the claim, after allowing for the $50 deductible. Since Abdul\u2019s plan, as second payor, is required to cover (under the coordination of benefits rules) the lesser of what it would have paid had it been the primary carrier ( $2,000) and the amount of the claim not covered by Jasmine\u2019s plan ( $1,000), the plan covered $1,000 of the expense. By combining the two plans, Jasmine was fully reimbursed for her dental expenses. 8.7 Agent\u2019s Service Role \u00b6 In some cases, the agent associated with a group plan is not actively involved in group business. His main responsibility, in this case, is the identification of a group prospect and introducing that prospect to a group representative. The agent receives a commission when the group plan is successfully put in place. However, if the agent is actively involved in both selling and servicing the group plan, the agent has the following responsibilities: Remaining up-to-date on the client\u2019s situation and needs; and Documenting the services provided. The introduction of a new plan in a workplace requires the agent to educate members about the plan and its benefits. 8.7.1 Ongoing awareness of client situation and needs \u00b6 The agent should plan regular meetings with the client to keep on top of issues as they arise and change. It is important for the agent to prepare a plan for recurring client-agent contact. This plan will help the agent to: Strengthen client-agent relationships; Assist the client with any concerns regarding the insurance company; Encourage client referrals; Request quotes from other providers and make recommendations if the client wishes to \u201cshop\u201d the plan. Contact should be made 90 days before the annual renewal date to check for changes needed in the renewal contract or to seek another provider. 8.7.2 Documentation of service provided \u00b6 As noted previously, documentation of the interaction with the client at all steps of the service process is very important for the protection of the client, agent and insurance company. The agent\u2019s file should include copies of all written communication, including emails, quotes and letters. It is important for the agent to record: Dates of contact with the client; What the agent discussed with the client; What action was taken; How the matter was solved. Note that it is essential for the agent to make special note of any contentious issues between the client, insurance company and agent. This documentation is kept in order to guarantee that: The client was properly served throughout the entire service process; and To keep a record in case a complaint is made in the future about the agent or the insurance company.","title":"Chapter 8 Group Plan Specifics"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_8_Group_Plan_Specifics/#chapter-8-group-plan-specifics","text":"","title":"Chapter 8: Group Plan Specifics"},{"location":"accident/Chapter_8_Group_Plan_Specifics/#81-understanding-the-group","text":"Group plan members actively working are automatically given coverage under the employee group plan.

Therefore, the premiums for large groups can be more accurately determined. For small groups, with 25 lives or fewer members, for example, the claims of the group cannot be expected to keep in line with actuarial norms.

An EAP is not insurance coverage but is instead a counselling service providing: Psychological counselling for psychological problems; Addiction counselling for drug or alcohol addiction; Marriage counselling for marital stress; Legal counselling for personal legal services including divorce, the preparation of a will, etc. An EAP is an attractive employee benefit. The addition of an EAP to a group plan is an acknowledgement that employees may have personal or work-related stress that could negatively impact their ability to do their jobs efficiently. Some employers provide on site EAP counselling services, but most employers provide services off-site through third-party providers to reduce cost as well as to reinforce the fact that the employee\u2019s use of the program is kept confidential. The benefits are in the form of consultation with a professional counsellor. The services are typically subject to annual deductibles, a co-insurance and perhaps a maximum number of hours of services per year. Example Sasha works for a large medical supply company that is in fierce competition with another major supplier. Market forces are putting a lot of financial pressure on her company and the senior executives are in turn putting a lot of pressure on their employees. As a consequence, Sasha is suffering from stress-induced stomach complaints, headaches and minor depression. Fortunately, her company has an excellent group benefits plan with an EAP. Through this program, Sasha is entitled to up to 10 hours of counselling with a psychologist, to help her develop coping strategies to deal with the pressure and avoid having to submit a stress-related disability claim.

Jasmine\u2019s plan has a $100 annual deductible on dental claims and a $1,500 annual maximum on restorative services. Abdul\u2019s plan has a $50 annual deductible on dental claims and a $2,000 annual maximum on restorative services. Last year Jasmine fell while hiking and damaged her front teeth.

Insurance law in Canada stems from three primary sources: Canadian Constitution \u2013 takes precedence over everything else; Common Law \u2013 originates from England; Legislation and regulation. The Canadian Constitution takes precedence over all other sources of law. All laws created, provincial and federal, must comply with the Constitution. Under the Constitution Act, 1867, the Constitution distributed legislative powers to create laws between the federal and provincial levels of government. Insurance law is considered to be an exclusive provincial matter under the Canadian Constitution. Common Law is law developed by judges based on the decisions of courts and similar tribunals (case law). Whereas, statute law is a civil law system based on laws adopted through the legislative process or regulation issued by the executive branch of government. Common Law is applicable everywhere in Canada except for Qu\u00e9bec where civil law based on the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec has jurisdiction. The principles relating to contract, torts, property, trusts and agencies are governed by Common Law. 1.1 Life and Accident and Sickness Insurance in Its Legal Context \u00b6 The Insurance Act defines an insurance contract as: \u201cThe undertaking by one person to indemnify another person against loss or liability for loss in respect of a certain risk or peril to which the object of the insurance may be exposed, or to pay a sum of money or other thing of value upon the happening of a certain event, and includes life insurance.\u201d 1.1.1 Life insurance \u00b6 Life insurance covers the financial risk of death. 1.1.2 Accident & Sickness insurance \u00b6 Accident and sickness insurance covers health risks such as: Disability; Long-term care needs; Critical illness; Prescription drugs; Accidental death; Accidental dismemberment. 1.1.3 Insurers \u00b6 Insurance contracts are created and underwritten by business corporations or mutual insurance corporations which are licensed by the government to act as insurers. 1.1.4 Agency relationship \u00b6 An agency relationship exists when a \u201cprincipal\u201d designates authority to an \u201cagent.\u201d This relationship of delegated authority is called \u201cagency.\u201d In all provinces and territories (except Qu\u00e9bec), the relationship between a life insurance company (principal) and a life insurance agent (who sells that company\u2019s policies) is an agency relationship. The agent acts on behalf of the insurance company (principal) by selling its insurance products. 1.1.5 Agents \u00b6 Insurance agents are either employed by individual insurers or are independent representatives of specific insurance companies contracted to sell that company\u2019s products to clients. The terms and limitations of the agent\u2019s authority are outlined in the written contract each agent signs with each company he represents. Insurance agents fall into one of two categories: Independent agent: Can represent a specific insurance company to sell that company\u2019s products to clients or can sell insurance policies from multiple insurance companies; Agents process their business through a managing general agent (MGA); MGA reviews the agent\u2019s insurance applications and submits to the insurer on behalf of the agent; The insurance company pays the MGA, who then pays the agent a commission according to the terms of their contract. Captive agent: Sells insurance products from a single company or bound by contractual stipulations or employment arrangements to represent a single MGA or insurance marketing entity; Is an employee of a specific insurance company and only sells that company\u2019s products; May be a self-employed worker having concluded a distribution agreement with an insurer or an insurer\u2019s affiliate (with an exclusivity clause) The terms and limitations of the agent\u2019s authority are outlined in the written contract each agent signs with each company he or she represents. 1.1.6 Managing general agent (MGA) \u00b6 MGAs perform many functions that facilitate business between agents, their clients and insurers. Those functions include: Supporting and assisting agents with obtaining contracts with insurers; Securing contracts with insurers so agents can sell their products; Processing and tracking business submitted by the agent; Providing sales support for agents; and The collection and payment of commissions; Training agents. 1.1.7 Agency \u00b6 An insurance agency has the following characteristics: Is either a partnership or a corporation; Holds a licence from the regulator(s); Must have at least one licensed insurance agent for the category for which the insurance agency holds a licence. Agents who want to expand their business by hiring, training and supervising other agents must apply for a corporate agency life licence and meet the requirements of the specific province where they intend to operate. Whether it is a partnership or corporation, a life insurance licence is required for any employee (or individual) who: Solicits insurance; Obtains or takes an application for insurance; Negotiates for or procures insurance; Transmits insurance applications and/or policies; Offers or assumes to act in the negotiation of insurance; Negotiates insurance continuance or renewal; Collects or receives a premium; Develops an illustration for life insurance. An insurance agency must be licensed in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. 1.1.8 Regulation of insurance and licensing \u00b6 Insurance legislation and regulation in Canada is governed by the provinces and territories. The name of the applicable regulatory and statutory framework varies from province to province. Under provincial and territorial insurance legislation: Designated actuaries are given extensive powers and responsibilities, including reporting on the financial soundness of a life insurer\u2019s business operations; Designated actuaries must belong to the Canadian Institute of Actuaries, and they must conform to its practices and processes Insurance agents must be licensed. 1.2 General Legal Principles Applicable to a Life Insurance Agent \u00b6 While each province has its own legislation, insurance legislation is very similar across all the provinces and territories (except Qu\u00e9bec) as they were formed based on a model statute created in the 1920s in cooperation with the \u201cUniform Law Conference.\u201d The law that applies to the interpretation of an insurance contract will be the law of the province or territory where the policy was contracted. These legal principles that govern insurance arise from Common Law or statutory law (statutes) and are addressed in the sections that follow: Capacity and status of persons; Natural persons, partnerships and legal persons (corporations); Minors and guardians; Power of attorney (POA) Marriage and common law unions; Divorce and separation; Wills, estates and successions; Trusts and trustees; Bankruptcy. 1.2.1 Capacity and status of persons \u00b6 The law requires that anyone, of any age, who is seeking to enter into any contract, must have \u201clegal capacity.\u201d Capacity means: A person\u2019s ability to provide valid consent; and that The individual is capable of understanding the terms of the contract and that they are entering into a binding agreement. The following excerpt from the Substitute Decisions Act (Ontario) illustrates the legal definition presumed for \u201clegal capacity\u201d: A person who is eighteen years of age or more is presumed to be capable of entering into a contract; A person who is sixteen years of age or more is presumed to be capable of giving or refusing consent in connection with his or her own personal care. Individuals who are mentally incapable lack the legal capacity to give valid consent, and therefore lack the legal capacity to enter into an insurance contract. There is no recognized maximum age at which a person is presumed to be incapable of giving valid consent age. 1.2.2 Natural persons (individuals), partnerships and legal persons (corporations) \u00b6 A \u201cnatural person\u201d is defined as a human being. A \u201cpartnership\u201d is an arrangement between two or more parties carrying on business together for the purpose of making a profit. In a partnership, all partners can sign a contract on behalf of the partnership and each partner is financially responsible for the contracts entered into by the partnership. A \u201clegal person\u201d is defined as a corporation \u2013 it is a separate legal entity distinctly separate from those who manage it or own it. Corporations have most of the property rights of individuals, and can enter into contracts, and buy, sell, and own all kinds of property. Business corporations are owned by shareholders. Shareholders can be individuals, other corporations or partnerships. According to the federal or provincial laws under which they are established, corporations are governed by a board of directors elected by the shareholders. Usually the executive officers, such as the president or secretary, are authorized (by a corporate bylaw or a resolution of the board of directors) to represent the company in specific transactions or activities. Insurance applications require the signatures of two signing officers. 1.2.3 Minors and guardians \u00b6 A \u201cminor\u201d is defined as a person under the \u201cage of majority.\u201d The age of majority varies from one province or territory to another. It is the age of 18 in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Qu\u00e9bec, and Saskatchewan and the age of 19 in British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and the Yukon. Provincial insurance legislation says that to purchase an insurance policy, a person of 16 years of age or older has the capacity to enter into a contract for insurance on his or her own behalf. Parents of minors aged 15 and under have an \u201cinsurable interest\u201d in their children \u2013 meaning that they may apply for and be the policyholder of a life insurance policy that will pay a death benefit upon the death of their children. Guardians for minor children may be appointed by: The child\u2019s parents; A court having jurisdiction. Court-appointed guardians are important in insurance practice for two main reasons: If an insurance death benefit is payable to a minor, the minor\u2019s guardian may be entitled to accept the payment from the insurance company; In applying for insurance on behalf of a minor, the guardian will be answering questions, completing the application and providing consent for the release of medical information on behalf of the minor. If there is no person capable of giving (and authorized to give), a valid discharge to the insurer for the insurance money, the insurer shall, within 30 days after receiving the evidence required, pay the money and any applicable interest into court to the credit of the minor. When paid to the court, the money will be managed by the Public Guardian and Trustee, if there is no trustee, or court-appointed guardian to receive it. 1.2.4 Power of attorney (PoA) and enduring power of attorney \u00b6 Adults may voluntarily appoint a legal representative (while they are still capable of doing so) to represent them and make decisions on their behalf when they are coming to their end of their life or in the case they become incapable. This is referred to as appointing a power of attorney. There are two types of powers of attorney: Power of attorney: A legal document made by one person who appoints a person called an \u201cattorney,\u201d to deal with the business and property of another person and to make financial and legal decisions on that person\u2019s behalf; A power of attorney ends if the person who gave the power of attorney becomes mentally incapable of making decisions. The attorney is also called the \u201cagent,\u201d and the person appointing the attorney is called the \u201cprincipal.\u201d Enduring power of attorney: A legal document made by one person (the principal) who appoints another person (the attorney or agent) to make financial and legal decisions for the principal. However, an enduring power of attorney will continue even if the principal becomes mentally incapable of making decisions. To create an enduring power of attorney, the document must be properly signed, and must state: Whether the attorney (the person appointed to make decisions) can act while the person is capable or only while the person is incapable; That the attorney\u2019s authority continues despite the incapability of the person. Depending on the terms of the document, a property power of attorney may come into effect immediately; or it may require someone, such as a doctor, to \u201ctrigger\u201d its effect by determining that the person who has granted the power of attorney has become incapable of managing his/her own affairs. The Power of Attorneys Act states that an attorney has the power to deal with the owner\u2019s property but not to make a will on their behalf. A beneficiary designation made by an attorney will be refused by most insurers unless a court order states otherwise or, in the case of an annuity contract, when a transfer of money takes place, in the presence of an existing beneficiary designation, from another financial institution made with the former financial institution. Otherwise, the attorney would be able to revoke a beneficiary designation made by the principal by transferring monies from one financial institution to another. Before accepting the instructions given by a power of attorney, insurance agents should obtain a certified true copy of the power of attorney document from a notary public, and then have it reviewed by the insurance company involved. If asked to do so, agents should not act as a power of attorney for a client. This arrangement is not covered by professional errors and omissions insurance, and could put the insurance agent in a conflict of interest with the client and, potentially, in trouble with the insurance regulator. If an adult becomes incapable and has not appointed a personal representative, in order to manage that individual\u2019s affairs, a court may appoint: A guardian; or A trust company. Trust companies can manage an incapable individual\u2019s financial affairs but not their personal care aspects. Court-appointed guardians: Are subject to the terms of the court; Are able to transact insurance business on existing policies on the behalf of the incapable adult individual; Are required to propose a property management plan for the incapable adult individual that is then subject to review from the court; Differ from a power of attorney in that guardianship only comes into effect after a person has been declared incapable; Cannot come into effect while a person is still mentally capable whereas a power of attorney can. A power of attorney for personal care (a \u201cliving will\u201d) is a legal document in which a specific person is named to act on an individual\u2019s behalf with respect to medical treatment and personal care needs. A living will: Simply addresses a person\u2019s treatment and personal care wishes; Does not necessarily designate authority to anyone else; Does not need to be written in any specific way. 1.2.5 Marriage and common-law spouse \u00b6 The rights of common law and married couples differ significantly upon relationship breakdown: In most provinces and territories, common-law partners can acquire the right to seek spousal support. However, common-law partners do not have rights to property division; Married couples have the right to spousal support and property division; Marriage is a formal legal status that is acquired and terminated under federal law. The legally recognized state of marriage immediately has significant effects on property ownership and civil rights that are subject to provincial and territorial law. In Canada, any two persons may become married, but individuals may only be legally married to one spouse at a time. Married status is retained until the death of a spouse, the annulment of the marriage or until a legally valid divorce is granted by court order. As such, separation does not legally end a marriage. Marriage creates both legal rights and obligations, which couples may amend or adjust through domestic or marriage contracts (i.e., prenuptial agreement). Common law couples can also enter into a domestic contract, sometimes called a \u201ccohabitation agreement.\u201d This is strongly advised to protect individuals living in common law arrangements as cohabitation agreements often deal with property division on relationship breakdown and succession rights upon death. 1.2.6 Divorce and separation \u00b6 In the event of divorce or separation, the value of an insurance policy may become subject to the division of property. However, insurance proceeds received are treated similarly to inheritances and gifts and may be excluded from the division of property. Grounds for divorce are governed by the Divorce Act and the right to spousal and/or child support payments on divorce also arises under the Act. An annulment ends a marriage but has a different meaning - the marriage is legally treated as never having been in effect. However it has the same legal effect as divorce - the marriage is dissolved and the divorced or unmarried persons are free to remarry. The effect of a divorce or separation on insurance needs analysis and beneficiary designation planning is an increasingly complex and important part of insurance law. 1.2.6.1 Family Property \u00b6 \u201cFamily property\u201d refers to property that was acquired during the marriage (or relationship), or is used or enjoyed by the family of married spouses, or that generates income that supports the family. Family property is presumed subject to equal division when the marriage relationship breaks down. Property that was acquired prior to the relationship, or that came from an inheritance during the marriage, usually gets protection from division. The rules are specific to the particular jurisdiction where the couple resides when the relationship ends and may be subject to judicial discretion (meaning a judge may order an unequal division of property). 1.2.7 Wills, estates and successions \u00b6 \u201cSuccession law\u201d refers to the body of provincial law that deals with deceased persons\u2019 estates and the rules governing what happens to their property after death. An \u201cestate\u201d is the collection of property and property rights that a deceased person owned. The person appointed to be in charge of someone\u2019s estate is known the executor (male) or executrix (female) or estate trustee (gender neutral). This appointment is made in one\u2019s will. If there is no will, or no willing and able executor, someone must apply to the court to be put in charge of the estate. This person will be recognized as an administrator or estate trustee. The executor: Must pay the debts and taxes owing of the deceased; Must manage and distribute the remaining assets according to the terms of the will of the deceased person. When a person dies, not all property owned by that individual is controlled by their will: Property held in \u201cjoint tenancy\u201d with one or more persons usually passes outside the will where the surviving joint tenant assumes full ownership of the property; Registered plans with a named beneficiary, including registered retirement savings plans (RRSP), registered retirement income funds (RRIF), and tax-free savings plans (TFSA), pass directly to the named beneficiary; Life insurance payable to a named beneficiary also passes outside the will and goes directly to the named beneficiary. However, when \u201cestate\u201d is listed as the beneficiary on a life insurance policy, the proceeds are distributed under the terms of the will; Financially dependent persons, such as a surviving spouse or children, can sue the estate for support if the deceased person owed them a duty of support and failed to make \u201cadequate\u201d provision in their will. The prior rights of financial dependants and spouses allow them to be adequately provided for even though they may receive life insurance as a named beneficiary. Such insurance may be considered part of the estate and made subject to an order for the support of dependants. Surviving spouses under pension law also obtain rights that have priority over designated beneficiaries, legatees and heirs, which are also received outside the will or the estate. 1.2.7.1 Testate and intestate successions \u00b6 A person may or may not have a valid will when they die: \u201cTestate\u201d is when someone dies and they have a valid will; \u201cIntestate\u201d is when someone dies without a valid will. Separation of married partners has no effect on a will and signing a separation agreement may allow alimony claims to be made against the other spouse\u2019s estate, but it does not usually affect voluntary gifts made by will or the designation of beneficiaries. If clients wish to disinherit a former legal former spouse (marriage) after separation, they need to change their will and their beneficiary designations, and need to sign a separation agreement Divorce does not affect the validity of a will. However, it is treated as though the former spouse predeceased the testator (only the provisions in the will that refer to the spouse are revoked). Likewise, a divorce does not revoke the designated beneficiaries, except in Qu\u00e9bec. A will made before marriage is automatically revoked upon marriage, unless the will was made with the marriage in mind (with a statement making reference to the upcoming marriage and the name of the spouse) Where there is a will, the executor will distribute the estate according to the terms of the will. Where there is no will, the estate administrator will distribute the estate in accordance with the applicable provincial rules of intestacy. If a policyholder\u2019s beneficiary designations contained in a will are revoked, and there is no valid beneficiary designation, the insurance or registered plan proceeds will become payable to the policyholder\u2019s estate. When the policyholder dies without a will, the estate will be distributed according to the provincial law that determines who inherits on intestacy. 1.2.8 Trusts and trustees \u00b6 A trust is established when one party (the settlor) gives another party (the trustee) property to hold for the benefits of a third party (the beneficiaries). Therefore, three parties are required to be part of a trust: Settlor\u2014the person who created the trust and from whom the assets come; Trustee\u2014A \u201ctrustee\u201d has legal title (as opposed to equitable title or beneficial ownership) to the property given to them \u201cin trust\u201d and in under legal obligation to act when the need arises; and Beneficiary\u2014the person who benefits from the trust. There are two main types of trusts: Inter vivos trust \u2013 established during a person\u2019s lifetime; and Testamentary trust \u2013 established upon death in the deceased person\u2019s will. Insurance proceeds can be used to create a trust fund or contributed to an existing trust fund. This is not the case for guardians and powers of attorney \u2013 they have certain powers over a person\u2019s property, but they do not take title to the property. Example Rob gives money to his lawyer, to be used towards Rob\u2019s purchase of a house. The money is put into the lawyer\u2019s trust account, so only he has control over it, and it is in his name. But there is no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind about who the money belongs to, or what it is to be used for. If the lawyer dies, or goes bankrupt, the trust money is unaffected, because it does not belong beneficially to the lawyer. Trustees can own any type of property that individuals can, so they can also hold an insurance policy, pay the premiums (from trust monies) as long as necessary, and then either transfer ownership of the policy to the beneficiary, or collect and handle the proceeds of the insurance in accordance with the terms of the trust. Insurance agents should not hesitate to direct clients to the clients\u2019 own legal advisors to provide for trust and estate planning. 1.2.9 Bankruptcy \u00b6 \u201cInsolvent\u201d means that a person is unable to meet their financial obligations as they come due (rent, bills, loan payments, mortgage, etc.). Note that a person may still have assets and income and be insolvent. When a person is unable to pay their debts, they may decide to make a formal declaration of bankruptcy, or they may be legally declared bankrupt. Either case leads to the appointment of a bankruptcy trustee. The trustee in bankruptcy collects the available assets of the bankrupt person and uses them to the benefit of the bankrupt\u2019s creditors according to the rules in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. It is also possible for an estate to be bankrupt, in which case the beneficiaries inherit nothing. Life insurance, or financial products that qualify as life insurance, including life annuities and segregated funds, may qualify for special protection against creditors in the event of an insolvency or bankruptcy of the policyholder. Naming an irrevocable beneficiary designation provides an opportunity to create creditor protection, even for beneficiaries outside the protected family class. In such situations, the policy itself (which could have substantial cash values) is not subject to seizure and cancellation by execution creditors. While a designation in favour of a spouse, child, grandchild or parent of a person whose life is insured, or any of them, is in effect, the insurance money and the rights and interests of the insured therein and in the contract are exempt from execution or seizure. Pension funds (including LIRA, LIF and annuities purchased with pension fund money) are also generally exempted from seizures. In some jurisdictions, registered products, such as RRSP and RRIF, are exempt from seizure, even without beneficiary designation, and even if issued by financial institutions other than life insurance companies. In every Canadian jurisdiction, other than Qu\u00e9bec, it is possible for the owner of certain registered products, such as RRSP, RRIF and TFSA, to designate a beneficiary (in that case, the beneficiary will receive the death benefit outside of the estate and avoid probate fees). 1.3 Legal Principles Required for the Validity of the Contract \u00b6 A contract or agreement established under Common Law principles is enforceable when: Intention to enter into a binding agreement exists for both parties; The subject matter of the contract is legal; Both parties are of mental capacity; and There is agreement by both parties. 1.3.1 Civil fault \u00b6 Civil fault is an action or omission which causes someone loss or harm for which the wrongdoer is liable. For example, if a life insurance agent breaches his or her privacy obligations, the client could take a civil action against the agent. The loss or harm in a tort is not limited to physical loss and may also include such items as: Injury to reputation (defamation of character); Economic injury; Emotional injury; Violations of privacy; Violations of property; Violations of constitutional neglect. 1.3.2 Limitation periods \u00b6 A \u201climitation period\u201d is a time frame during which a court action must be started. If court action is not started within this period, the right to sue is permanently lost. Once someone discovers that a civil wrong has been done to them, the limitation period clock starts ticking. There are different limitation periods for different torts as dictated in each province. Example John died. His beneficiary Betty filed a claim for a life insurance benefit. The insurer refused to pay, claiming John had misrepresented his health on his application. Betty will only have a finite length of time to launch a lawsuit. 1.4 Public Insurance and Retirement Regimes \u00b6 Both the federal and provincial levels of government have set up programs that contribute to the social \u201csafety net\u201d for citizens and others. Insurance agents need to understand all aspects of these public insurance and retirement regimes and take into account relevant information and coordination of benefits. \u201cCoordination of benefits\u201d is designed to prevent someone from getting paid twice for the same expense: It could arise when both spouses (and their family members) are entitled to benefits (drugs, medical, dental); It could also arise when an individual has multiple plans, such as private and public coverage; When coordination benefits, one benefit plan pays first at the specified coverage and the second plan only covers any remaining portion. 1.4.1 Federally sponsored or facilitated programs \u00b6 The following federally sponsored plans exist: Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and disability; Old Age Security (OAS) and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS); Employment Insurance. The purpose of the CPP, OAS and GIS plans is to provide a secure modest base upon which to build additional retirement income. They are not intended to meet all the retirement income needs of Canadians. It is the agent\u2019s role to guide their clients with other insurance products which may be used to achieve retirement objectives (such as tax planning, estate planning, financial security, investment and/or creditor protection) such as RRSPs, annuities, life insurance, etc. The purpose of the Employment Insurance (EI) program is to provide temporary income support to those who are between jobs; cannot work for reasons of sickness, childbirth, or parenting, or who are providing care or support to a family member who is gravely ill with a significant risk of death. It is the agent\u2019s role to guide their clients with other insurance products which may supplement EI should benefits offered under this federal plan be insufficient to meet the client\u2019s needs (i.e., disability, accidental death and dismemberment and long-term care insurance). 1.4.1.1 Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and disability \u00b6 Intended to provide a modest level of retirement income. Funded by employer and employee contributions (not by government revenues). The contributions made by the employer are deductible on the employer\u2019s income tax return. The employee can claim a tax credit for the amount of the employee contribution. Spouses may split CPP benefits. An individual who is eligible for benefits can start receiving benefits any time between age 60 and age 70. If between the ages of 60 and 65, the pension benefit is reduced. If applied for after the age of 65 and up to the age of 70, the individual will receive an enhanced pension benefit. Benefits are taxable for the employee when received. Self-employed individuals must pay both the employer and the employee contributions. A tax deduction can be claimed for the amount of the employer\u2019s portion and a tax credit can be claimed for the employee\u2019s portion. 1.4.1.2 Old Age Security (OAS) and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) \u00b6 OAS: Intended to help provide a modest level retirement income; Funded by government revenues (individuals and employers do not contribute); Benefits are based on the amount of time an individual has lived in Canada; An individual who is eligible for benefits can start receiving benefits any time between age 65 and age 70; Benefits are taxable for the recipient. GIS: Provides additional income to very low-income individuals who are already receiving OAS; Benefits are nontaxable for the recipient. 1.4.1.3 Employment Insurance (EI) \u00b6 Provides benefits (financial assistance) Canadians who were previously employed but lost their job (through no fault of their own). All employees must contribute. Self-employed individuals are not eligible for EI. Benefits are taxable. 1.4.2 Provincially or territorially sponsored or facilitated programs \u00b6 The following provincial level plans will be addressed: No-fault automobile insurance; Workers\u2019 compensation; Universal health care and drug plan. While the purpose of such plans varies, all provide public coverage to individuals in certain circumstances and avoid lawsuits. 1.4.2.1 No-fault automobile insurance \u00b6 No-fault insurance is a provincially sponsored plan whereby a resident of the province (the policyholder) and his or her passengers are not only reimbursed by the policyholder\u2019s own insurance company without proof of fault, but also restricted in the right to seek recovery through the civil-justice system for losses caused by other parties. Main difference from fault-based insurance (and subsequent litigation) is that with no-fault insurance the insured person is compensated (for health care and income replacement benefits) by their own insurance company. British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Qu\u00e9bec have government-run insurance programs, whereby the province provides the basic insurance benefits (which vary from one jurisdiction to another) in the event of an accident, and private insurers compete to sell top-up coverage. 1.4.2.2 Workers\u2019 compensation \u00b6 Provides compensation and rehabilitation benefits to workers on a no-fault basis (that is, neither the employer nor employee need to be found at fault). The rules vary from province to province. Benefit payments are funded by mandatory employer contributions. Workers give up the right to sue their employer when they receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. 1.4.2.3 Universal health care and drug plan \u00b6 The provincial health care plan provides medically necessary care and treatment available through publicly funded doctors and hospitals. The provincial plan also covers prescription drug costs for those with low income, seniors, the disabled and residents in long-term care facilities and hospitals. There is no harmonized federal plan. The provinces and territories remain responsible for the management, organization and delivery of health care services. There are 13 separate provincial and territorial plans. Anyone who is covered under one provincial plan can enjoy benefits Canada-wide. 1.5 Other Relevant Provincial and Territorial Legislation for Life Insurance Agents \u00b6 It is essential for agents to be continually aware of the obligations that apply to them. Poor awareness of such obligations may hurt clients and result in severe consequences for an agent, which could include monetary penalties, suspensions or revocation of the agent\u2019s insurance licence. The obligations of an insurance agent are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4. 1.5.1 Privacy Act \u00b6 Life insurance agents have access to a large amount of client information that is both sensitive and personal. Privacy legislation is intended to regulate how advisors manage such information. The Privacy Act is federal legislation governing how the federal government handles personal information. 1.5.1.1 PIPEDA - Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act \u00b6 Governs how businesses collect, use or disclose personal information during the course of their business activities. Controls how federally regulated businesses must act in handling employee personal information. Ensures that only relevant information that is necessary for business transactions be collected. Furthermore, the information should be properly disposed of (i.e., shredded) when it is no longer needed. Where provinces have chosen to pass laws similar to PIPEDA, those laws take precedence in the province. Three provinces have passed laws for privacy and three others have adopted legislation protection personal health information. Provinces have also appointed Privacy Commissioners whose mandate is directed at maintaining the privacy of health care information. They are also involved with freedom of information activities on behalf of citizens seeking to obtain public government information. 1.5.2 Human Rights Legislation \u00b6 Under provincial and federal human rights legislation, discrimination on the basis of a number of personal and/or group attributes and characteristics is prohibited. On a federal level such legislation includes the Canadian Human Rights Act. Discrimination is forbidden on the basis of gender, religion, skin colour, national origin, family status, marital status, sexual orientation, and age. Insurers, however, are permitted to discriminate in providing insurance coverage as long as they can justify it on reasonable and bona fide grounds. 1.6 Other Relevant Federal Legislation for Life Insurance Agents \u00b6 As life insurance agents conduct business with clients, they should take into consideration: The Criminal Code; The Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act; The National Do Not Call List; and Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation. 1.6.1 Criminal Code \u00b6 The Criminal Code is a Canadian federal law defining behaviour and actions that constitute a crime,\u201d and are generally more serious offences, including those that may result in jail time as well as fines. 1.6.2 Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) \u00b6 The Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act is designed to detect and prevent illegally obtained money from entering the Canadian banking system. Insurance products can be used as wealth creation, storage and transfer tools. As such, insurance agents have a personal responsibility to report suspicious transaction and suspected possession of terrorist property to FINTRAC \u2013 Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada. 1.6.3 National Do Not Call List (DNCL) \u00b6 DNCL \u2013 Do Not Call List: Individuals may register their phone numbers for the DNCL requesting not to be called by telemarketers; Telemarketing calls to numbers in the DNCL are prohibited; Calls to businesses are not prohibited; Life insurance agents who wish to prospect via telemarketing must register and subscribe to the National DNCL. A telemarketer calling on behalf of an insurance agent must comply with the DNCL. 1.6.4 Anti-spam legislation \u00b6 Effective July 1, 2014, federal legislation prohibits the sending of spam emails \u2013 \u201ccommercial electronic messages\u201d (CEM) where the sender does not first have the recipient\u2019s consent. All CEM emails must give the recipient an option to unsubscribe, which must be honoured within 10 business days. Agents should establish and document, from their very first dealings with clients, the practices to be followed when dealing with their clients\u2019 personal information. The Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, SC 2017 prohibits anyone from forcing a person to undergo a genetic test as a prerequisite for providing them with goods or services, for entering into or maintaining a contract with them or for offering or maintaining specific terms within the framework of contract. The law contains the same prohibition on the communication of results of a genetic test.","title":"Chapter 1 Legal Framework"},{"location":"ethics/Chapter_1_Legal_Framework_Governing_Life_Insurance/#chapter-1-legal-framework-governing-life-insurance","text":"Insurance agents need to be familiar with the legal aspects of insurance. Insurance law in Canada stems from three primary sources: Canadian Constitution \u2013 takes precedence over everything else; Common Law \u2013 originates from England; Legislation and regulation. The Canadian Constitution takes precedence over all other sources of law. All laws created, provincial and federal, must comply with the Constitution. Under the Constitution Act, 1867, the Constitution distributed legislative powers to create laws between the federal and provincial levels of government. Insurance law is considered to be an exclusive provincial matter under the Canadian Constitution. Common Law is law developed by judges based on the decisions of courts and similar tribunals (case law). Whereas, statute law is a civil law system based on laws adopted through the legislative process or regulation issued by the executive branch of government. Common Law is applicable everywhere in Canada except for Qu\u00e9bec where civil law based on the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec has jurisdiction.

If there is no person capable of giving (and authorized to give), a valid discharge to the insurer for the insurance money, the insurer shall, within 30 days after receiving the evidence required, pay the money and any applicable interest into court to the credit of the minor.

This is referred to as appointing a power of attorney. There are two types of powers of attorney: Power of attorney: A legal document made by one person who appoints a person called an \u201cattorney,\u201d to deal with the business and property of another person and to make financial and legal decisions on that person\u2019s behalf; A power of attorney ends if the person who gave the power of attorney becomes mentally incapable of making decisions. The attorney is also called the \u201cagent,\u201d and the person appointing the attorney is called the \u201cprincipal.\u201d Enduring power of attorney: A legal document made by one person (the principal) who appoints another person (the attorney or agent) to make financial and legal decisions for the principal. However, an enduring power of attorney will continue even if the principal becomes mentally incapable of making decisions. To create an enduring power of attorney, the document must be properly signed, and must state: Whether the attorney (the person appointed to make decisions) can act while the person is capable or only while the person is incapable; That the attorney\u2019s authority continues despite the incapability of the person. Depending on the terms of the document, a property power of attorney may come into effect immediately; or it may require someone, such as a doctor, to \u201ctrigger\u201d its effect by determining that the person who has granted the power of attorney has become incapable of managing his/her own affairs. The Power of Attorneys Act states that an attorney has the power to deal with the owner\u2019s property but not to make a will on their behalf. A beneficiary designation made by an attorney will be refused by most insurers unless a court order states otherwise or, in the case of an annuity contract, when a transfer of money takes place, in the presence of an existing beneficiary designation, from another financial institution made with the former financial institution. Otherwise, the attorney would be able to revoke a beneficiary designation made by the principal by transferring monies from one financial institution to another. Before accepting the instructions given by a power of attorney, insurance agents should obtain a certified true copy of the power of attorney document from a notary public, and then have it reviewed by the insurance company involved. If asked to do so, agents should not act as a power of attorney for a client. This arrangement is not covered by professional errors and omissions insurance, and could put the insurance agent in a conflict of interest with the client and, potentially, in trouble with the insurance regulator. If an adult becomes incapable and has not appointed a personal representative, in order to manage that individual\u2019s affairs, a court may appoint: A guardian; or A trust company. Trust companies can manage an incapable individual\u2019s financial affairs but not their personal care aspects. Court-appointed guardians: Are subject to the terms of the court; Are able to transact insurance business on existing policies on the behalf of the incapable adult individual; Are required to propose a property management plan for the incapable adult individual that is then subject to review from the court; Differ from a power of attorney in that guardianship only comes into effect after a person has been declared incapable; Cannot come into effect while a person is still mentally capable whereas a power of attorney can. A power of attorney for personal care (a \u201cliving will\u201d) is a legal document in which a specific person is named to act on an individual\u2019s behalf with respect to medical treatment and personal care needs. A living will: Simply addresses a person\u2019s treatment and personal care wishes; Does not necessarily designate authority to anyone else; Does not need to be written in any specific way.","title":"1.2.4 Power of attorney (PoA) and enduring power of attorney"},{"location":"ethics/Chapter_1_Legal_Framework_Governing_Life_Insurance/#125-marriage-and-common-law-spouse","text":"The rights of common law and married couples differ significantly upon relationship breakdown: In most provinces and territories, common-law partners can acquire the right to seek spousal support.

Married status is retained until the death of a spouse, the annulment of the marriage or until a legally valid divorce is granted by court order. As such, separation does not legally end a marriage.

The person appointed to be in charge of someone\u2019s estate is known the executor (male) or executrix (female) or estate trustee (gender neutral). This appointment is made in one\u2019s will.

Either case leads to the appointment of a bankruptcy trustee. The trustee in bankruptcy collects the available assets of the bankrupt person and uses them to the benefit of the bankrupt\u2019s creditors according to the rules in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. It is also possible for an estate to be bankrupt, in which case the beneficiaries inherit nothing. Life insurance, or financial products that qualify as life insurance, including life annuities and segregated funds, may qualify for special protection against creditors in the event of an insolvency or bankruptcy of the policyholder. Naming an irrevocable beneficiary designation provides an opportunity to create creditor protection, even for beneficiaries outside the protected family class. In such situations, the policy itself (which could have substantial cash values) is not subject to seizure and cancellation by execution creditors. While a designation in favour of a spouse, child, grandchild or parent of a person whose life is insured, or any of them, is in effect, the insurance money and the rights and interests of the insured therein and in the contract are exempt from execution or seizure.

The policyholder is also the \u201cinsured\u201d (which may be different than the \u201clife insured\u201d). A life insurance policy is simply the contract between an insurer (insurance company) and the policyholder. Depending on the type of insurance, there may be other persons referenced or involved (such as the life insured, the beneficiary, a contingent beneficiary, a successor owner or an assignee). 2.1.1 Insurer \u00b6 The insurer is the life insurance company that issues the insurance policy. Through corporate purchases and amalgamations, the insurer may change over the life of the policy. When there is a change in the insurer, the rights and obligations under a policy are assigned to and assumed by the new insurer. The new insurer is required by regulators to issue certificates of assumption to affected policyholders. All terms of the policy continue to be binding on the parties to the policy. 2.1.2 Policyholder \u00b6 The policyholder is the legal owner of the life insurance policy: The policyholder can be an individual or a corporation; There can be multiple policyholders for a single policy where each policyholder may own different portions of the policy. For example, a business owner can structure a universal life policy so that the business itself (the corporation) becomes the owner of the death benefit but the business owner retains ownership of savings and investment component. Example 1 Thelma and Arthur are spouses. They co-own a policy on both their lives, which will pay the death benefit when the second life insured dies. Example 2 Elliot and Alice are siblings. After a meeting with their father and their agent, they have opted to own and pay for an annuity policy with their father as beneficiary. This annuity provides for the care and financial needs of their father who retired with limited income. This ensures that as siblings, they will both have access to policy information and that any beneficiary changes to the policy must be approved and signed jointly. Example 3 Roger owns ABC Bikes Inc., a cycling equipment company. The company needs financial protection against the death of Roger, who is a key person in its operations. Roger purchases insurance on his life and assigns the ownership of the death benefit to the company. Roger retains ownership of the savings and investment component, where he will be able to shelter personal investment capital for retirement. The company and Roger divide the cost of the insurance on a reasonable basis, with the help of their accountant. 2.1.2.1 Successor policyholder \u00b6 When the policyholder is not the life insured, a policy may also have a successor policyholder (sometimes called the contingent policyholder, successor-owner or subrogated owner): The successor policyholder becomes the policyholder if the original policyholder dies before the life insured dies (i.e., before the policy pays a death benefit); If the policyholder has not named a successor policyholder, then the new owner will be his estate and therefore indirectly his estate beneficiaries. Example Roger owns a policy on his own life and one on the life of his spouse, Susan. Roger wants ownership of the policy on Susan to pass to her if he dies first, and not to his children, so he appoints Susan as the successor owner by an amendment to his policy. While Susan is not a party to the policy during Roger\u2019s life, after his death Susan will acquire all of the rights and privileges that Roger had under the policy. 2.1.3 Life insured \u00b6 The life insured is the person whose life is insured \u2013 the policy pays the death benefit when this person dies. There may be multiple lives insured under one policy. For life insurance to be valid at issue, the policyholder must have an insurable interest in the life of the life insured. 2.1.4 Beneficiary \u00b6 The beneficiary is the person (or corporation) who receives the insurance proceeds when a death benefit is paid according to the insurance policy. Anyone can be named as a beneficiary. A preferred beneficiary includes: Spouse (including the common-law spouse); Child; Grandchild; Parent of the life insured. The preferred beneficiary is also known as \u201cprotected\u201d or \u201cfamily class\u201d beneficiaries. Designating individuals from this class as beneficiaries of a policy protects the death benefit and the policy itself from execution and seizure by creditors. The policyholder may later name or change a beneficiary using a beneficiary designation or change form issued by the insurer unless the existing designation is irrevocable. Beneficiary designations are revocable unless designated as irrevocable. With revocable beneficiary designations, a different beneficiary, including another protected class beneficiary can be named without the beneficiary\u2019s permission. There may be restrictions on a policyholder changing beneficiary designations, such as a separation agreement, or even a Court order, despite the fact that a designation may be shown on the records of an insurer as revocable. It is important for agents to be aware that insurers will pay the death benefit based on the most recent beneficiary designation recorded on file, or to the estate in accordance with the most recent will or estate document filed with the insurer if there is no beneficiary designation. An individual can also designate his/her estate as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. In this case, the executor or estate trustee would distribute the proceeds according to policyholders\u2019 will or the relevant provincial law if the policyholder died intestate. 2.1.4.1 Irrevocable beneficiary designations \u00b6 Where a beneficiary designation has been designated as irrevocable, such a declaration must be filed with the head office of the insurer to become valid. When the designation is irrevocable, the policyholder (policy owner) must first obtain the consent of the beneficiary before making a change of beneficiary. If the beneficiary does not consent to the change, the policy owner cannot change the beneficiary designation. According to The Insurance Act in Nova Scotia, to make a valid irrevocable beneficiary designation, the irrevocable beneficiary designation must contain, attached to the policy, the following declaration signed by the insured: I understand that the effect of my designating a beneficiary irrevocably is that, under the provisions of the Insurance Act, while the beneficiary is living, I may not alter or revoke the designation without the consent of the beneficiary and I may not assign, exercise rights under or in respect of, surrender or otherwise deal with the contract without the consent of the beneficiary. It must also contain the following declaration signed by the agent: I certify that I have fully explained to the insured the nature and effect of making an irrevocable designation of beneficiary and such explanation was given to the insured not in the presence of the beneficiary and that the insured indicated that he was aware of the irrevocable nature of the designation so made by him. A policy with an irrevocable beneficiary designation is exempt from execution of judgment and seizure by creditors. 2.1.4.2 Restriction in legislative definition of beneficiary \u00b6 Some Insurance Acts define \u201cbeneficiary\u201d as \u201ca person, other than the insured or the insured\u2019s personal representative to whom the death benefit should be paid.\u201d A policyholder or his/her estate does not qualify as a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d under the Insurance Act. Meeting the requirements of the statutory definition could be critical in determining whether a life insurance policy can enjoy potential creditor protection. In all provinces and territories except Qu\u00e9bec, creditor protection hinges on the relationship between the life insured and the beneficiary (not between the policyholder and beneficiary). Example 1 Ted owns a policy on the life of his wife Laura and has named himself as the beneficiary. Ted is the policyholder, i.e., the person who entered into the policy with the insurer. Ted, therefore, does not qualify as a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d under the statutory definition. He will still receive the insurance money if Laura dies. If Laura owned the policy on her life, so that she was both the insured, as well as the life insured, and she named Ted as her beneficiary, he would qualify as a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d under the legislative definition. Example 2 Rick purchases a policy on his own life. He is both the policyholder and life insured. He designates his spouse Renee as beneficiary. She qualifies as a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d under the statutory definition, since she is not the policyholder. The proceeds are therefore presumed to be protected from the creditors of Rick\u2019s estate. Also, since Renee is the spouse of the life insured (Rick), Renee is also within the protected class of beneficiaries. Accordingly, the rights and interests of Rick in the contract itself during his lifetime are also exempt from execution or seizure. 2.1.4.3 Loss of protection \u00b6 The designation of a beneficiary, including a protected class beneficiary, is subject to being set aside and ignored if it is made in an attempt to defeat, delay, or hinder creditors. Thus, designations that are made in an attempt to defeat creditors may be subject to challenge, despite the insurance provisions. The same would apply to the purchase of a life annuity or segregated fund, which otherwise would benefit from protected status. Example Rick owns a life policy with a very large cash value payable to his estate. He learns that a lawsuit from a business supplier has gone against him, and the creditor is about to obtain a judgment against him, so he designates his son Roger as a beneficiary. Roger is within the protected family class of beneficiaries, but the timing of Rick\u2019s action shows it was intended to frustrate his supplier\u2019s claim. Therefore, the designation may be subject to challenge. 2.1.4.4 Contingent beneficiary \u00b6 A contingent beneficiary or secondary beneficiary can be named so that if the primary beneficiary dies before the life insured dies (i.e., before the insurance policy pays a death benefit) then the contingent beneficiary becomes the one entitled to receive the benefits payable. If there are multiple beneficiaries (primary or contingent) and one or more die before the life insured, the policy provisions, beneficiary designation form provisions (also part of the policy) or statutory provisions (in default of policy provisions), may determine how the proceeds are redistributed. If there is no valid primary or contingent beneficiary designation in effect on the death of the life insured, the insurance proceeds will be paid to the current policyholder or to its estate if the policyholder dies after the primary and contingent beneficiary. 2.1.5 Group insurance policies \u00b6 A group insurance policy insures the lives or health of a group of individuals: Spousal and dependent coverage are often available with many group plans; The group of individuals is typically restricted to the employees of a company or members of a group such as a union or association. 2.1.5.1 Plan sponsor \u00b6 In a group insurance policy, the plan sponsor enters into the master contract (insurance policy) with the insurer (insurance company). The plan sponsor is typically an employer, union, association, or some other entity that represents the group. The plan sponsor is also known as the group insured or the group policyholder. The plan sponsor decides on the terms of the insurance policy (and potential insurance benefits available) for the members of the group. 2.1.5.2 Insurer \u00b6 The insurer (the life insurance company) does not have individual policies with each member of the group. Rather, there is a single contract between the insurer and the plan sponsor (group policyholder). 2.1.5.3 Members and scope of coverage to other insured persons \u00b6 The group life insured refers to any person whose life is insured under the group policy. Group plans define who is eligible for coverage, which typically includes the members (also called \u201cparticipants\u201d or \u201cenrollees\u201d) of the group and their families. With employer-sponsored plans (as opposed to a union or association), a basic level of coverage is typically mandatory for each employee. Many plans offer the ability to apply for \u201coptional\u201d increased insurance coverage, which is subject to individual underwriting. Membership in an employee group plan is mandatory so that the insurer can count on a relatively constant number of lives, upon which the premiums may be calculated. Another reason is to prevent the \u201canti-selection of the risks.\u201d An employee must enroll in the plan within a defined period of time after gaining eligibility status. Subject to the provisions of the plan, making coverage changes is usually limited to an annual event, or perhaps to times when there are life changes in the group life insured\u2019s situation, such as marriage, births or adoptions. 2.1.5.4 Beneficiaries \u00b6 The group life insured may designate a beneficiary (or multiple beneficiaries) to receive the insurance benefit for which they are the life insured under the group policy. 2.2 Formation of Policy \u00b6 In common law, for a contract to be formed, there must be: An agreement as to what is being contracted (the terms of the contract); An exchange of value, including a promise, to make the insurance policy binding. For example, with life insurance, the exchange of value is that the insurer promises to pay a benefit upon the occurrence of a specified condition, and the policyholder agrees to pay the premiums. 2.2.1 Rules about forming an individual insurance contract \u00b6 The process of forming any contract is often described as having two steps, called \u201coffer\u201d and\u201cacceptance.\u201d The offer may be outstanding for a limited period of time, according to its terms. If not accepted, it may be withdrawn. With an insurance contract, the concept of offer and acceptance is unique. An insurance agent presenting a proposal to a potential client is not representative of an offer of insurance in the standard offer-acceptance principles of contracting. Rather, in practice, the completion of an insurance application by an individual is generally considered an offer where the individual becomes the offeror. Then, in practice, the offer is generally accepted when the insurance carrier issues the contract and the contract is delivered to the applicant. However, under the law of the Canadian common law jurisdictions, it is the insurer\u2019s tender of the policy which constitutes the \u201coffer,\u201d and the \u201cacceptance\u201d takes place only when the applicant decides to take (receive) the policy. Tender of delivery by the insurer is its offer and indicates its willingness to insure the risk not a binding contract, which is consummated only when the insured accepts the policy on delivery. The insurer and the applicant have clearly effected the contract, and that is the point of view where it may be said that the contract is \u201cmade.\u201d In comparison with ordinary contracts, life insurance policies have several additional requirements before they are considered to be valid and in effect. The requirements are: Application for insurance and representation of risk; Temporary or conditional insurance coverage; Changes in insurability; Acceptance of application by insurer; Payment of initial premium; Delivery of policy. 2.2.1.1 Application for insurance and representation of risk \u00b6 It is the policyholder and the insurer who are the parties to the policy. When completing an insurance application, it is important that agents not paraphrase. Questions should be asked to the client exactly as written in the application, so as to ensure a complete and accurate response for the insurer. The answers recorded in the application are used as a benchmark against which \u201cchanges in insurability\u201d are later measured when the insurance policy is issued. All of the answers provided by the applicant (and the proposed life insured when both the proposed life insured is different from the applicant) on both the application form and any additional document such as a questionnaire constitute representations to the insurer that it will rely upon during the underwriting process. 2.2.1.2 Temporary Insurance \u00b6 When applying for insurance, it typically takes several weeks (sometimes months) for an insurer to complete their underwriting process and issue a policy. However, applicants can sometimes obtain temporary coverage during this process. If the applicant can answer \u201cno\u201d to three or four temporary insurance questions confirming good health and no illness or hospital visits. The temporary coverage is typically for 90 days, is subject to terms and conditions outlined in a separate temporary coverage agreement and expires once the policy applied for, is approved, or declined. 2.2.1.3 Changes in insurability \u00b6 Change in insurability \u2013 If the client has a \u201cchange in insurability\u201d between when the application was made and when the policy is delivered, then the policy does not take effect. Even if it was delivered, accepted and the first premium had been paid. A change in insurability corresponds to a change in risk, and, therefore, the insurance company is entitled to know about any such changes before being bound to the coverage. This is the case whether the policyholder and the life insured knew about the change in insurability, or not. Example George applied for life insurance in October. In November, he went to his physician to get a routine influenza shot. The insurance policy was to be delivered in early December. If George is asked by the agent about changes in his insurability, he could truthfully answer \u201cnone,\u201d even if he is not entirely sure what that means. But, if George is asked whether anything has happened that would change an answer in his application, he must answer \u201cyes\u201d and disclose his medical appointment and influenza shot, since applications typically ask about the date of the last visit to the doctor and any treatment prescribed or recommended. The insurance company can then decide if the updated information changes anything; in this case, they would give the agent permission to go ahead and deliver the policy. 2.2.1.4 Approval of application by insurer \u00b6 If the insurer decides to make an offer of insurance, they will notify the applicant of their underwriting decision and prepare a policy to be delivered if the applicant indicates they wish to go ahead. The policy tendered may include changes from the presumed terms and conditions the applicant contemplated when they applied. This may include a different underwriting classification, either better or worse than requested in the application. It could contain exclusions to the proposed coverage and changes to the premium to be paid by the applicant if the offer is accepted. 2.2.1.5 Delivery of policy \u00b6 The insurance policy will be printed out and sent to the agent for \u201cdelivery\u201d to the applicant, together with any instructions relating to delivery requirements. If there are no delivery requirements and money has already been received, it may be sent directly to the applicant. The insurance policy is not in force until all delivery requirements have been obtained and the first premium paid. If a premium was submitted with the application, and the application is accepted, then the insurance comes into force on an effective date (the policy in-force date) determined by the insurer. If no premium has been submitted and the policy is being applied for as cash on delivery (COD), then the insurance will not be in force until payment is received by the insurer after the insurance policy has been delivered. 2.3 Term and Termination of Policy \u00b6 An insurance policy may be cancelled at any time by the policy owner. In specific circumstances it may be cancelled by the insurer. 2.3.1 Rescission: 10-day-free look \u00b6 When an insurance policy is delivered to the client, the client has 10 days to review the policy and decide if he or she wants to keep the coverage or not. During this time, the client can change his or her mind and return the policy for a full refund. If the client chooses to exercise this \u201cright of rescission\u201d then the policy is annulled (the technical term is rescission), which means the contract is withdrawn and cancelled. The 10-day-free look applies to all individually owned life and A&S insurance policies. Therefore, a policyholder can rescind an insurance contract within 10 days of signing or accepting delivery of the policy, without penalty and with a reimbursement of the premiums paid. For individual annuity contracts relating to segregated funds, there is also a 2-business-day rescission right. 2.3.2 Surrender \u00b6 Individual insurance contracts are unilateral \u2013 the policyholder can \u201csurrender\u201d a policy, for any reason, at any time. The insurance company cannot. The termination of a policy results in the policyholder and beneficiary surrendering all their rights under the policy. Any cash surrender value (CSV) associated with the policy will be paid out to the policyholder, according to the terms of the policy, when the policy is terminated. Whether a policy has a cash surrender value depends on the type of permanent insurance and policy funding levels. 2.3.3 Expiry or termination \u00b6 An insurance policy (or a portion of it) may simply terminate or expire as per the terms of the contract. For example, a T10 policy will terminate after 10 years. Although it may be renewed, the option to renew may no longer be offered when the client reaches a certain age (for example, 80 years). Even guaranteed renewable and convertible term policies will have a limit, after which, they cannot be converted to permanent insurance, and an age threshold, beyond which they cannot be renewed. They also have a termination date, at which point the policy and its coverage simply expire, according to the terms of the policy. 2.4 Termination by the Insurer \u00b6 In certain circumstances, insurance policies can also be cancelled by the insurance company: Termination for fraud, misrepresentation or concealment; Termination for non-payment of accident insurance premiums; Termination for non-payment of premiums. 2.4.1 Termination in the event of fraud, misrepresentation or intentional concealment \u00b6 Insurance fraud occurs when the applicant and/or the proposed insured person commits any of the following: Makes a deliberate misstatement; Deliberately fails to inform the insurer of a material fact; and/or Obtains insurance for which the policyholder or insured person does not otherwise qualify. For example: Failing to disclose that the life insured/applicant had been recently treated for an illness or disease such as cancer; Claiming to be a non-smoker when the person in fact smokes; or Claiming they need the insurance for personal reasons when in fact the policyholder intends to sell it to someone else. Misrepresentation and concealment can be thought of as a genuine mistake. On the other hand, fraud is a deliberate attempt to mislead the insurer. Depending on whether or not the misrepresentation was innocent or fraudulent, and depending on when it was discovered by the insurer: During the application process; Within the first two years; or After two years, several different potential outcomes are possible. 2.4.1.1 During the application process \u00b6 If the client makes an innocent misrepresentation of some factual information during the application process, the insurer is entitled to adjust the coverage to the appropriate amount of coverage for the level of premium if the truth had been known, or to simply not proceed with the applicant. Example Josephine did not want to write her true age on the application form and said she was of five years younger than she really is. When her agent verified the application form with her identification, he saw the misrepresentation of age, corrected the application and adjusted the coverage sought accordingly. Insurance Acts contains statutory protection against termination for misstatement of age including when the applicant has lied and the mistake in age was somehow not discovered until the policy was already in force. The insurer would be entitled to amend the contract and adjust the coverage to match the premiums paid or adjust the premiums to the correct amount for the true age. 2.4.1.2 Within the first two years \u00b6 If a misrepresentation (other than age) was discovered during the first two years of the policy, the policy could be cancelled (voided) by the insurer. This two-year period is known as the statutory incontestability period. After the two-year incontestability period, the insurance company can no longer cancel a policy for an inadvertent misrepresentation or concealment. If the misrepresentation is an intentional and deliberate attempt to mislead the insurer (insurance fraud) then the incontestability period does not apply and the insurer can cancel the policy at any time for fraud. Example Jacob takes out a new life insurance policy in September. In answering the questions about tobacco usage, Jacob denies ever using any form of tobacco. He forgot that he smoked a cigar at the charitable golf tournament he participated in last month. A picture in the local paper shows him with a cigar in hand, celebrating with his winning foursome. His agent sees the picture, contacts Jacob and explains the risks he may be running by not clarifying his mistaken answer with the insurer. Jacob elects to complete a tobacco usage questionnaire, confirming his single usage of a cigar and has his agent brings his mistake to the attention of the insurance company. The insurer decides to take no action. The two-year incontestability period ends and Jacob is now protected against the insurance company changing its mind about his inadvertent misrepresentation. 2.4.1.3 After two years \u00b6 Once the policy has been in force for two years (the incontestability period), the insurer can only cancel the policy based on fraudulent misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment. Example Arne dies of bowel cancer three years after buying a policy. A thorough review of his medical history in response to the claim for the death benefit reveals that Arne had a previous round of bowel surgery for cancer four months before he applied for the insurance. But he stated on the application that he had never had any indication of, or treatment for, cancer. Arne committed insurance fraud \u2013 deliberate misrepresentation and concealment. The insurance company refuses to pay the death claim. 2.4.2 Termination for non-payment of sickness or accident insurance premiums \u00b6 For insurance to remain in effect, a policyholder must pay premiums when they are due according to the insurance contract. If a policy has been issued or a renewal certificate has been delivered, even in error, and the premiums have not been paid, the policy will stay in force until a termination notice is sent. The insurer (insurance company) may terminate the policy by mailing a postage prepaid, registered, written notice of termination to the last known address of the policyholder; The insurance policy will be cancelled (and the coverage will be ended) after the 10 days\u2019 written notice. The ten days are measured from the day after the insurer mails the notice of termination. As such, the coverage will end on the 11 th day. 2.4.3 Termination for non-payment of life insurance premiums \u00b6 If life insurance policy premiums are not paid in a timely fashion, any term life policy or permanent life policy with no cash values will also terminate, subject to a 30-day grace period. There may be exceptions in the case of specific types of life policies that have cash values which permit for non-payment of premiums provided the cash value can support the premiums owed. The cancellation is not final, however, since the insurer is obliged to reinstate the individual life insurance under the following conditions: The client applies for the reinstatement within two years of the date of the cancellation; and The insurer determines that the insured still meets the insurability conditions of the cancelled contract. 2.5 Assignment of a Policy \u00b6 A policyholder has the right to assign a policy - assign or transfer ownership \u2013 to another party. However, the right to assign is not unlimited. For example, in some provinces, practices, such as trafficking, which refer to certain forms of trading, buying and selling life insurance policies, are prohibited. There are two types of assignments: Absolute assignment; and Collateral assignment. 2.5.1 Absolute assignment \u00b6 Absolute assignment means a transfer of ownership of an insurance policy. A change in ownership is a disposition for tax purposes, and may result in taxable policy gains for the original owner (assignor) when ownership is relinquished. The new owner has all the rights of the original policyholder (the assignee), including: The right to designate a new beneficiary; and The right to withdraw money from the policy. These are variously called viatical settlements, life settlements, or Stranger Owned Life Insurance (STOLI). Individuals may be induced to sell their existing policies or obtain a new insurance policy for the purpose of selling as a means of raising necessary funds. 2.5.2 Collateral assignment \u00b6 Collateral assignment refers to the fact that some insurance policies (those with cash values) may be acceptable to third party lenders as collateral for a loan. The assignment of ownership of the policy to the lender, as collateral, restricts the policyholder from doing anything with their policy that could affect the value of the security. When the loan is ultimately repaid, the collateral assignee releases their right to the policy and full ownership reverts to the original policyholder. If the life insured dies before the loan is fully repaid, the lender is entitled to only a portion of the death benefit \u2013 the amount required to pay back the loan. Any remaining amount is paid to the insurance beneficiary. 2.6 Product Specific Policy Provisions \u00b6 Specific policy provisions of the following products as they relate to insurance of different types will be reviewed: Individual life insurance; Group life and health insurance; Individual and group accident and sickness insurance; Annuities; Segregated funds (individuals variable insurance policies); Pension products and other group annuity products. 2.6.1 Individual life insurance \u00b6 Basic provisions contained in all life insurance policies are usually summarized within the policy, and include: The name of the insured and the life insured; The amount of insurance proceeds payable (death benefit) by the insurer and the conditions under which the amount becomes payable; The amount and frequency of premium The grace period; The particulars of potential dividend payments (in the case of a participating policy) The conditions for policy reinstatement (if the policy lapses) If applicable, the options of: Surrendering the contract for cash; Obtaining a loan or an advance payment of the insurance proceeds; Obtaining paid-up insurance or extended insurance; Renewal and conversion privileges, including include whether the cost of the coverage on renewal is fixed in advance or not and how it would be determined on renewal or conversion. 2.6.1.1 Statutory conditions \u00b6 Provincial and territorial insurance acts stipulate that the following documents constitute the entire agreement between the parties involved in a life insurance contract: Application; Policy; Any document attached to the insurance policy when issued; Any amendment (also called rider, endorsement or addendum) to the policy agreed to in writing after the policy is issued. 2.6.1.2 Reduction \u00b6 Some policies contain provisions that reduce the coverage over time, such as a death benefit that reduces as the life insured reaches a specific age(s). Example Regina purchased a reducing term policy that ran to age 70; the policy death benefit contractually reduced to $25,000 at age 60, further reduced to $10,000 at age 65, and will terminate coverage at age 70. 2.6.1.3 Exclusion \u00b6 An exclusion is a specific provision where, if death caused by some exclusion in the insurance policy, then the life insurance policy does not pay any death benefit. Example Nicky purchased a large individual life policy; but due to her having a pilot\u2019s licence and her frequent involvement with both flying in private planes and practising underwater sports, the policy contained two exclusions: 1 death caused by or as a consequence of underwater diving and 2 death caused by flying in a plane as other than a fare-paying passenger, i.e., as a pilot or crew member. 2.6.1.4 Exclusions \u2013 contractual or imposed by law \u00b6 Exclusions may be imposed by law (as opposed to being imposed in the life insurance contract) and are established by decisions made by the courts. They may relate to actions that are deemed a violation of public order, or because the beneficiary or insured caused or ran the very risk insured against, which constitutes grounds for denying the claim for, or the payment of, insurance proceeds. 2.6.1.5 Pre-existing conditions exclusions \u00b6 Some policies contain exclusions for death resulting from a pre-existing condition or related pre-existing condition. Such exclusions are more common in disability policies, which means that the insured would not be covered for a condition for which they have already been diagnosed. 2.6.1.6 Suicide clause \u00b6 If a life insured commits suicide, a life policy may or may not pay, depending on when the individual committed suicide. If the suicide occurs within the first two years that the policy is in effect, it will typically not pay. After a policy has been in effect for a stipulated period of time, typically past two years, the insurer would pay the death benefit even if the death were due to suicide. 2.6.1.7 Living benefits \u00b6 Some insurance policies allow a portion of the death benefit to be paid to the policyholder in advance of death in the case of a terminal illness or shortened life expectancy. Further, if the life insured becomes totally disabled, the policyholder may be able to withdraw any policy cash values on a tax-free basis. 2.6.1.8 Cash surrender value (CSV) \u00b6 Certain types of permanent insurance (such as a participating whole life insurance policy) allow for the accumulation of cash inside the policy. The cash surrender value (CSV) is the amount of cash that the policyholder will receive if the policy is cancelled (surrendered). Cash can be accumulated on either a guaranteed basis or on a non-guaranteed basis which is determined by the performance of an investment account inside the policy. The CSV will be reduced by things such as outstanding policy loans, unpaid premiums, and insurance policy surrender charges. 2.6.1.9 Distinction between collateral loans and insurance policy loans \u00b6 Other than the limits imposed by the institution making the loan, there is no other limit on the size of the loan when an insurance policyholder uses an insurance policy as collateral for a loan. The amount of the loan will usually be a percentage of the CSV. Unlike a collateral loan, an insurance policy loan has limits because of the way life insurance policy transactions are taxed. If too much money is borrowed from an insurance policy, the policyholder could receive policy gains which are taxable as regular income. 2.6.1.10 Riders (policy amendments) \u00b6 Riders are additional features or benefits added to a policy. Also referred to as \u201cadditional benefits\u201d or \u201cattached benefits.\u201d A rider may change existing benefits, or provide additional, increased coverage. 2.6.2 Group life and health insurance \u00b6 In a group insurance arrangement, a single insurance policy called the master policy covers the plan members (or participants) and their eligible dependants \u2013 the group of people eligible for coverage under the plan members. The plan sponsor is the entity that enters into the insurance contract with the insurance company. The plan sponsor is also known as the group policyholder or group insured. The plan sponsor decides which benefits and features will be included with the group insurance policy. 2.6.2.1 Determination of the plan member group \u00b6 The group must be clearly defined to determine who is entitled to coverage. 2.6.2.2 Premiums and cost sharing \u00b6 When the group policyholder is an employer, the employer is responsible for paying the premiums owed to the insurer (even though the cost sharing might be 50% by the employer and 50% by the employee). Non-payment of premiums can result in the termination of the master contract. The individual members have no contact with the insurer and have no responsibility (or no ability) to pay premiums to the insurer. The plan sponsor typically collects premiums from the plan members and then makes the premium payments owing to the insurance company. Premiums are not guaranteed and can change annually. Example Quality Corp. had a terrible year. Five young employees were injured or became disabled through sickness, and went on long-term disability (LTD) benefits. Upon renewal, the group benefits insurer determined that the premium for the LTD benefit coverage had to rise very substantially. The agent provides renewal terms to Quality Corp. and is asked questions on the changes to the premiums. The agent who has discussed renewal terms with the insurer informs his client that the insurer must set aside rather large reserves to fund a potential long-term disability, especially if a claimant is young and in the early stage of their working life. Those costs must be passed along to the group plan. 2.6.2.3 Types of group insurance \u00b6 There are many types of group insurance coverage, including: Life insurance; Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) insurance; Short term disability (STD) and long-term disability (LTD) plans (income replacement plans); Critical illness (CI) coverage; Health care and dental care. Coverage under these kinds of plans usually has defined annual dollar limits and is sometimes stipulated in a collective agreement between the employer and the union that represents the employees. The plan sponsor can adjust the coverage to suit their budget and the age and preferences of their employee population. Many employers offer the employee a dollar budget to allocate to their own choice of coverage, called flexible benefits. 2.6.2.4 Administrative services only (ASO) \u00b6 ASO refers to a plan structure where the employer itself funds the benefits for employees (self-insurance) rather than purchasing insurance from an insurance company. In this case, plan sponsors often hire an insurer to process, adjudicate and administer claims and payments. However, the employer (not the insurer) funds any benefits payable. Since July 1, 2014, long-term disability plans for federally regulated employees must be insured. 2.6.2.5 Certificates \u00b6 In a group insurance structure, the individual members of the group have no contact directly with the insurer. In this case, the insurer provides a certificate to each group member. The insurer provides the certificates to the employer, who then distributes to the individuals. The certificate contains individualized information for that particular group, including: The name of the insurer; Identification of the contract; The amount (or the method of determining the amount) of insurance on any person whose life is insured under the plan (member, spouse, or dependent); The circumstances in which the insurance terminates; The rights of the group plan member (or spouse or dependent, if applicable) upon termination. 2.6.2.6 Booklets \u00b6 Sometimes plan sponsors will provide booklets to help outline the details of the group insurance plan. Booklets are summaries of policy details \u2013 not insurance policies. When a group insured person who is under the age of 65 leaves the group, he/she must be given the opportunity to convert his or her group life insurance policy into an individual insurance policy without any medical underwriting. This right must be exercised within 31 days from when the plan member\u2019s life is no longer covered under the group insurance contract. 2.6.2.7 Access to copy of policy \u00b6 Within the same group plan, different \u201cclasses\u201d of employees may be entitled to different levels of benefits. The employer may not want those details provided to all group members and can choose to restrict access to policy details for specific classes of employees. For example, executives at a company may have access to a much more comprehensive insurance plan than entry-level staff. In this case, the entry-level staff would likely not be provided with the details or particulars of the executive plan. There is not the same legislative entitlement to a copy of the master or group policy, as there is for individual insurance policies. 2.6.2.8 Laws applicable to members (residence) \u00b6 Companies may have employees and offices in multiple provinces and territories. The law of the province where a group life insured lives when he becomes a member of the plan is the law that applies in determining that individual\u2019s rights and obligations under the plan. 2.6.2.9 Term and termination \u00b6 Almost all group insurance policies are annually renewing term insurance policies. Group members qualify for coverage the group coverage becomes available to them. There is very little security for continuation of the coverage, unless they die or are already receiving long-term disability benefits before the group plan terminates. Group policy premiums are not guaranteed and can increase annually at the time of contract renewal. The plan sponsor can change or reduce the benefits coverage or change insurer. Group benefit coverage terminates with the termination of the master policy (except for persons already on claim or eligible to make a claim). Individual coverage will generally terminate when an individual leaves membership in the covered group (i.e., terminates employment) or becomes ineligible for membership. 2.6.3 Individual and group accident and sickness insurance \u00b6 Individual or group accident and sickness (A&S) insurance is used to protect against the following risks: Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D); Disability; Drug insurance; Critical illness (CI); Long-term care (LTC). 2.6.3.1 Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) \u00b6 AD&D insurance covers the risk of suffering a defined physical loss or death due to an accident. Physical losses can include loss of limbs, hearing or eyesight. The insurance policy states the death benefits and the benefits payable for dismemberment (or paralysis) are often expressed as a percentage of the death benefit payable. For example, consider a policy with a death benefit of $100,000 and a 50% benefit payable for the loss of a limb. In this case, if the insured loses his arm, he would receive $50,000. Processing a death claim may take some time as the insurer needs to determine if the death was accidental and not caused by some exclusion. The definition of \u201caccident\u201d for insurance purposes is complex and often includes many restrictions and exclusions: Insurers might not pay if the death or dismemberment is a result of the following exclusions: Death from or involving sickness; Illness; Bodily or mental infirmity or disease; Suicide or self-inflicted injury; War (declared or undeclared); Riot; Events involving the ingestion of alcohol, drugs, poison or sedatives; Events involving the commission of a criminal offence or assault; Extreme sports, racing; Certain surgical mishaps. Personal accident insurance can provide hospitalization benefits and income after an accident. 2.6.3.2 Disability specifics \u00b6 Individual disability insurance coverage can be detailed and complex, with a combination of factors including full and partial disability, as well as a temporary or permanent reduction in the ability to earn an income. FIO \u2013 Future Income Option is a benefit that may be added to some policies which gives the policy owner the option to increase his/her coverage whenever he/she earns an increase in income. This ensures the policy continues to adequately cover the individual over time. Disability coverage takes effect when the insurance policy is delivered and the applicant pays the premium and confirms that he or she is still in good health (i.e., no change in health since the time of application). 2.6.3.3 Drug insurance \u00b6 Individuals may choose to purchase their own health insurance covering the cost of expensive medication. In such cases, they would be both the policyholder and the life insured. Such private plans cover the cost of medication and prescription drugs and often vary widely regarding coverage, features and benefits. 2.6.3.4 Critical illness (CI) \u00b6 This type of insurance protects against the risk of suffering a life-threatening illness. A CI policy typically pays a lump sum benefit if the insured person is diagnosed with a critical illness, such as cancer, heart attack, or stroke. The person must survive for a period usually 30 days to be entitled to the benefit payment. Insurance policies often include up to 25 critical illnesses and conditions. CI policies often have additional features and benefits such as a return of premium (ROP) upon death or cancellation of the policy if no claim had been made. 2.6.3.5 Long-term care (LTC) \u00b6 This type of insurance protects against when the insured can no longer safely and independently perform a number of Activities of Daily Living (ADL), or suffers from a loss of mental function and must be supervised. Benefits are often paid on a weekly or monthly basis. Benefits are not intended to replace income, and can be spent in any way the policy owner chooses. All LTC plans have a waiting period \u2013 the period of time an individual must wait before they can make a claim. The waiting period is also known as the elimination period. In Canada, all LTC policies have a waiting period - typically 30, 90, or 180 days: Activities of daily living include: Feeding oneself; Getting dressed; Grooming and hygiene, including bathing; Getting in and out of bed; Using the toilet. Disablity and LTC insurance can cover individuals in many different living arrangements, including: At home care; Adult day care; Retirement home; Assisted-living setting; Long-term care facility. LTC insurance can include coverage for the following: Nursing care; Rehabilitation and therapy; Personal care \u2013 help performing ADLs such as bathing and eating; Homemaking services such as cleaning, laundry, and preparing meals. 2.6.3.6 Parties \u00b6 Similar to the case with other types of insurance, the policy owner might not be the same person as the life insured under an LTC policy. There may also be co-owners of an insurance policy. In some cases, a corporation or partnership may own accidental death, disability or critical illness coverage on a key employee, partner or shareholder. 2.6.3.7 Rights of parties \u00b6 The rights of the policyholder and the beneficiary are governed by the insurance policy. The provincial and territorial insurance statutes also contain provisions relating expressly to accident and sickness insurance. 2.6.3.8 Effective date \u00b6 Individual AD&D policies can often take effect quickly (sometimes immediately when the application is accepted) because medical underwriting is not required. On the other hand, sickness insurance requires underwriting and therefore usually involves a longer period of time before the policy takes effect. In either case, the insurance policy will specify the effective date. 2.6.3.9 Termination of accident and sickness insurance \u00b6 Coverage can be terminated at any time by the policy owner by giving written notice and surrendering the policy. A policy will be terminated for non-payment of premiums (after the expiry of any grace period defined in the policy). If the insurer is providing notice of termination to the client by postal mail, unlike life insurance a 10 days\u2019 written notice is required measured from the day after the notice is mailed. The 10 days would be in addition to the grace period, if the cancellation is for non-payment. Cancellable \u2013 refers to the type of policy where the insurer can cancel the policy by providing written notice and satisfying the notice period. Policies can be cancelled for reasons other than non-payment of premiums. Non-cancellable policies can only be cancelled by the insurer for non-payment of premiums owing. 2.6.3.10 Statutory conditions \u00b6 Individual accident and sickness policies must contain the following details: The name or a sufficient description of the insured and the person insured; The amount or the method of determining the amount of the insurance money payable and the conditions under which it becomes payable; The amount or the method of determining the amount of the premium and the period of grace, if any, within which it may be paid; The conditions under which the contract may be reinstated if it lapses; The term of the insurance or the method of determining the day upon which the insurance commences and terminates. Group accident and sickness policies have similar policies; however, a certificate must be issued outlining the plan\u2019s basic coverage particulars. 2.6.4 Annuities \u00b6 Annuities are insurance policies, designed to pay a fixed amount over a specified period of time. Annuity contracts may be used as investments, financial security, tax planning, estate planning, and/or creditor protection. With a life annuity, benefits are paid for the duration of a person\u2019s life. Whereas a term annuity pays benefits for only a defined period of time (also called a fixed-term annuity). Annuities (life annuities as well as fixed-term annuities) issued by life insurance companies are treated as life insurance under the various provincial and territorial insurance acts. Annuities can be either individual or as group contracts. Annuities can be purchased as either registered contracts (that is, purchased with funds from an RRSP, RRIF, TFSA, RRP, DPSP, LIF, LIRA, etc.), or as unregistered contracts. With deferred annuities, payments start at some later date. The start date is called the maturity date. This allows for the investment and accumulation of income over the period of time before payments begin. With immediate annuities, payments start immediately. The annuity contracts products available on the market are: Annuity contracts relating to segregated funds are also deferred annuities, and can be owned in either individual or group plans; Guaranteed interest accounts (GIA), which may be available as an individual or group annuity. This type of annuity is a deferred annuity. The amounts (called \u201ccontributions\u201d or \u201cpremiums\u201d) are alienated by the holder to the insurer to purchase a non-variable annuity contract; and Immediate annuity contracts, which may be available as an individual or as part of a group annuity contract. 2.6.4.1 Parties \u00b6 An annuity has the following parties: The insurer who provides the periodic payments (typically monthly). The policyholder who is the individual who enters into the contract with the insurance company. The annuitant or life insured who is the individual whose life the length of the annuity is based upon. The annuity grantee can be named as the person to receive the annuity payments. When registered, the policyholder, annuitant, and annuity grantee is the same person. 2.6.4.2 The policyholder \u00b6 The policyholder, often referred to as the \u201cannuitant\u201d in annuity contracts, or as the \u201cinvestor,\u201d can name a beneficiary and can determine who receives the benefits. 2.6.4.3 Annuitant (life insured) \u00b6 The annuitant is the individual on whose life the duration of a life annuity is based. It should be noted that an annuitant is not always the one who gets the payments. The annuitant is also known as the life insured. An annuity may be based on a joint life expectancy (more than one life). On the death of the first annuitant, there may be a second or successor annuitant, for example a spouse. 2.6.4.4 Payee \u00b6 The policyholder may name an annuitant grantee to receive the annuity payments. The payee is sometimes called the \u201cannuity grantee,\u201d but is also often referred to as the \u201cannuitant.\u201d For all registered contracts, the policyholder, the annuitant (life insured) and the payee are always the same person. For non-registered annuity contracts, it is possible to have two or three different persons with respect to the policyholder, the annuitant and the payee (for instance, X acting as the policyholder and annuitant, and Y as payee, or X acting as policyholder, Y as annuitant and Z as payee). 2.6.4.5 Immediate annuities \u00b6 Immediate annuities (also called payout annuities) provide that the first payment will begin on the next defined periodic annuity frequency period, whether that is monthly, quarterly, semiannually or on the first anniversary date (annually). Deferred Annuities Deferred annuities are subject to annual accrual taxation during the accumulation phase (before the maturity date). Registered accumulation annuities are not subject to accrual taxation (a form of registered savings plan where all the income will be taxable upon payment). Withdrawal and surrender rights For immediate annuities: Withdrawal or surrender while the annuitant is alive is generally not permitted; Withdrawal or surrender options may (subject to the terms of the policy) be available upon the death of the annuitant; Death of a sole annuitant will trigger payment of the balance of the annuity to the named beneficiary, failing which it will be paid to the estate of the policyholder. For deferred annuities: Withdrawal or transfer while the annuitant is alive is generally permitted in the case of annuities related to segregated funds, subject to the terms of the insurance policy (annuity contract); A possible market value adjustment (MVA) and withdrawal fees may apply; The death of a sole annuitant (before maturity) will trigger payment of the balance of the policy to the named beneficiary or, if none, to the estate of the policyholder. For guaranteed Investment Account (GIA): As with most guaranteed rate, interest-bearing vehicles, withdrawal and transfer while the annuitant is alive is not anticipated and not generally permitted. Death may trigger liquidity, subject to the terms of the policy. 2.6.4.6 Group annuities \u00b6 May be entered into by a group, such as an employer, a union, a professional corporation or association, for the benefit of their employees or members. An employer may use a group annuity contract with a life insurance company to capitalize a pension fund, a PRPP (Pooled Registered Pension Plan), a group RRSPs, a DPSPs, as well as other registered or unregistered contracts. The plan administrator holds an annuity policy for the benefit of all the members of the plan, who make contributions to it or for whom contributions are made. Group annuities typically have fewer management rules than individual annuities. This results in potentially lower administrative costs. The parties to a group annuity contract are the group plan sponsor and an insurance company. The plan members are generally the members of the group (i.e., employees). 2.6.4.7 Structured settlements \u00b6 A structured settlement is a single-premium annuity that is non-assignable, non-commutable and non-transferrable. Structured settlements are a special kind of annuity, typically involved in court settlements. Instead of a lump-sum payment, a judge could award a customized stream of damage payments to be funded through the purchase of a structured settlement annuity. Structured settlements are given special tax treatment. In that, payments awarded as compensation for personal injury are not considered income from a tax perspective as it is considered compensation for the loss of the ability to earn an income and not the actual loss of income. The stream of payments from the annuity policy is not taxable to the recipient, provided that: They are not purchased by the injured party or someone on their behalf; The payments from the annuity are irrevocably directed to the injured party; The party at fault would be liable for the payments. 2.6.5 Segregated funds \u00b6 A segregated fund is also known as an Individual Variable Insurance Contract (IVIC). A segregated fund is actually an annuity contract, and the premiums paid are invested in segregated funds. The segregated funds are managed by the insurance company and the value of the contract will vary over time based on the value of the underlying investments. Segregated funds guarantee to pay at least 75% of what the policyholder paid to the plan before age 75, on death or maturity, even if the investments are worth less. Example Tom invests $100,000 into a segregated fund with a 75% death benefit guarantee. The investments decline to $60,000, and Tom dies. The beneficiary of Tom\u2019s plan will be entitled to $75,000 (75% of $100,000) even though the market value of the investments is only $60,000. The parties to a segregated fund are the insurer and the policyholder. Policies are established when the application for the policy is accepted by the insurer and the first payment is received along with any other opening requirements needed by the insurer. Segregated funds are governed by insurance legislation, not securities law. At the point of sale the agent must provide the policyholder with the following documents: Summary Information Folder: In contrast to mutual funds, which are issued with a prospectus, segregated funds are sold with a Summary Information Folder which provides an overview of the details and information about the policy. The Fund Facts and the Key Facts document: Often found inside the information folder. A copy of the application form must also be remitted to the client. The Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association (CLHIA) guidelines CLHIA has prepared a series of 18 Guidelines, on a wide variety of topics, for the guidance of its members. The CLHIA Guideline G2 \u2013 Individual Variable Insurance Policies Relating to Segregated Funds, establishes industry standards including standards for: Advertising disclosure; Presale disclosure requirements; Policy disclosure, including minimum contractual terms; Policyholder rights; Audit and accounting requirements; Investment disclosure; Minimum investment standards; Corporate governance of segregated funds; Partitioning of assets held in segregated funds; Closing of segregated funds; and Fundamental changes to and merger of segregated funds. CLHIA\u2019s Guideline G2 does not apply to segregated funds available through group annuity contracts and there is also no guarantee under segregated funds purchased under a group annuity contract. 2.6.6 Pension products and other group annuity products \u00b6 Group annuity contracts are governed by the relevant insurance and income tax legislation, as well as by CLHIA\u2019s Guideline G12 entitled Capital Accumulation Plans. Pension funds funded with group annuities are governed primarily by the relevant Pension Benefits Act. They are also governed by the provincial/territorial Insurance and Income Tax Acts and also by CLHIA\u2019s Guideline G12 (for defined contribution plans). The two primary types of pension plans are: Defined benefit pension plan (DBPP) \u2013 each individual\u2019s pension benefit is based on a formula in relation to the individual\u2019s income and years of service (not based on the financial performance of the plan); Defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) \u2013 each individual\u2019s pension benefit is determined by the investment performance of the investments in the plan. Each employee typically can select his/her own investment choices from a range of options provided. Pooled registered pension plan (PRPP) are a new and are intended for individuals who are self-employed, or who do not have access to an employer-sponsored pension plan. New legislation concerning PRPPs will need to be enacted in every provincial and territorial jurisdiction. 2.7 Other Products \u00b6 Tax-free saving accounts (TFSA), registered retirement saving plans (RRSP), registered retirement income funds (RRIF), locked-in retirement accounts (LIRA) and life income funds (LIF) can all be offered through group or individual contracts. Deferred profit-sharing plans (DPSP) are only offered as group products (i.e., not available as an individual contract). 2.7.1 Deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP) \u00b6 A deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP) is a retirement savings plan that permits employers to contribute a portion of the company\u2019s profits to a plan for the benefit of some or all employees. Only the employer contributes \u2013 the employee does not contribute. Contributions vest after two years, and recovered by employees when they leave employment and transferred to another DPSP, an RRSP or other pension plan. 2.7.2 Tax-free savings account (TFSA) \u00b6 A TFSA is an investment account where contributions are not tax-deductible, withdrawals are not taxable, and investments grow tax-free inside the plan. Contributions are limited: $5,000 annually for 2009-2012, $5,500 in 2013 and 2014, $10,000 in 2015, and $5,500 in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and $6,000 in 2019. Note that, at the time of writing, the PC government has increased the limit to $10,000 for 2015. Both the Liberals and the NDP promise to reduce this back to $5,000 or $5,500 if elected. Therefore, future TFSA contribution limits are uncertain at this time. Unused deposit room is carried forward. Contribution to a spouse\u2019s plan is permitted. Re-contributions to the plan after funds have been withdrawn are also permitted. The owner of a TFSA can designate a beneficiary. If the beneficiary is not a spouse, the funds are simply received as a distribution that bypasses the deceased plan holder\u2019s estate. If the beneficiary is a spouse, the account can be transferred to the surviving spouse (also called a \u201csuccessor\u201d plan holder). When contracted through a life insurance company, it may be set up through a group or an individual annuity contract. 2.7.3 Registered retirement savings plans (RRSP) \u00b6 RRSP withdrawals are unrestricted, but are subject to withholding tax which may require increases with the amount withdrawn. Unlike a TFSA, re-contribution to an RRSP is not permitted. 2.7.4 Registered retirement income fund (RRIF) \u00b6 A RRIF is a retirement income payout plan with the greatest opportunity for income deferral through minimized withdrawals. Withdrawals are not required until age 71. RRIFs also provides flexibility for unrestricted withdrawals, subject to withholding tax. 2.7.5 Locked-in retirement account (LIRA) \u00b6 A locked-in retirement account (LIRA) is another type of registered retirement savings plan designed to accept funds transferred from a pension plan. Withdrawals from LIRA accounts are generally not permitted before age 55. From a tax point of view, a LIRA is an RRSP, for which additional rules from pension benefits legislation apply. 2.7.6 Life income fund (LIF) \u00b6 Similar to a LIRA, a life income fund (LIF) is also designed to accept a transfer of pension assets when an individual leaves a pension plan. Minimum and maximum withdrawals apply to LIF accounts. From a tax point of view, a LIF is a RRIF, for which additional rules from pension benefits legislation apply.","title":"Chapter 2 Insurance Policy Provisions"},{"location":"ethics/Chapter_2_Insurance_Policy_Provisions/#chapter-2-insurance-policy-provisions","text":"","title":"Chapter 2: Insurance Policy Provisions"},{"location":"ethics/Chapter_2_Insurance_Policy_Provisions/#21-parties-to-an-individual-policy","text":"A life insurance contract is formed by two parties: Insurer \u2013 the life insurance company that issues the insurance policy; Policyholder \u2013 the owner of the life insurance policy.

For example, a business owner can structure a universal life policy so that the business itself (the corporation) becomes the owner of the death benefit but the business owner retains ownership of savings and investment component. Example 1 Thelma and Arthur are spouses. They co-own a policy on both their lives, which will pay the death benefit when the second life insured dies. Example 2 Elliot and Alice are siblings. After a meeting with their father and their agent, they have opted to own and pay for an annuity policy with their father as beneficiary. This annuity provides for the care and financial needs of their father who retired with limited income. This ensures that as siblings, they will both have access to policy information and that any beneficiary changes to the policy must be approved and signed jointly. Example 3 Roger owns ABC Bikes Inc., a cycling equipment company. The company needs financial protection against the death of Roger, who is a key person in its operations. Roger purchases insurance on his life and assigns the ownership of the death benefit to the company. Roger retains ownership of the savings and investment component, where he will be able to shelter personal investment capital for retirement.

Example Roger owns a policy on his own life and one on the life of his spouse, Susan. Roger wants ownership of the policy on Susan to pass to her if he dies first, and not to his children, so he appoints Susan as the successor owner by an amendment to his policy. While Susan is not a party to the policy during Roger\u2019s life, after his death Susan will acquire all of the rights and privileges that Roger had under the policy.","title":"2.1.2.1 Successor policyholder"},{"location":"ethics/Chapter_2_Insurance_Policy_Provisions/#213-life-insured","text":"The life insured is the person whose life is insured \u2013 the policy pays the death benefit when this person dies.

Anyone can be named as a beneficiary. A preferred beneficiary includes: Spouse (including the common-law spouse); Child; Grandchild; Parent of the life insured. The preferred beneficiary is also known as \u201cprotected\u201d or \u201cfamily class\u201d beneficiaries. Designating individuals from this class as beneficiaries of a policy protects the death benefit and the policy itself from execution and seizure by creditors. The policyholder may later name or change a beneficiary using a beneficiary designation or change form issued by the insurer unless the existing designation is irrevocable. Beneficiary designations are revocable unless designated as irrevocable. With revocable beneficiary designations, a different beneficiary, including another protected class beneficiary can be named without the beneficiary\u2019s permission. There may be restrictions on a policyholder changing beneficiary designations, such as a separation agreement, or even a Court order, despite the fact that a designation may be shown on the records of an insurer as revocable. It is important for agents to be aware that insurers will pay the death benefit based on the most recent beneficiary designation recorded on file, or to the estate in accordance with the most recent will or estate document filed with the insurer if there is no beneficiary designation. An individual can also designate his/her estate as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy.

According to The Insurance Act in Nova Scotia, to make a valid irrevocable beneficiary designation, the irrevocable beneficiary designation must contain, attached to the policy, the following declaration signed by the insured: I understand that the effect of my designating a beneficiary irrevocably is that, under the provisions of the Insurance Act, while the beneficiary is living, I may not alter or revoke the designation without the consent of the beneficiary and I may not assign, exercise rights under or in respect of, surrender or otherwise deal with the contract without the consent of the beneficiary. It must also contain the following declaration signed by the agent: I certify that I have fully explained to the insured the nature and effect of making an irrevocable designation of beneficiary and such explanation was given to the insured not in the presence of the beneficiary and that the insured indicated that he was aware of the irrevocable nature of the designation so made by him.

Meeting the requirements of the statutory definition could be critical in determining whether a life insurance policy can enjoy potential creditor protection. In all provinces and territories except Qu\u00e9bec, creditor protection hinges on the relationship between the life insured and the beneficiary (not between the policyholder and beneficiary). Example 1 Ted owns a policy on the life of his wife Laura and has named himself as the beneficiary. Ted is the policyholder, i.e., the person who entered into the policy with the insurer. Ted, therefore, does not qualify as a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d under the statutory definition. He will still receive the insurance money if Laura dies. If Laura owned the policy on her life, so that she was both the insured, as well as the life insured, and she named Ted as her beneficiary, he would qualify as a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d under the legislative definition. Example 2 Rick purchases a policy on his own life. He is both the policyholder and life insured. He designates his spouse Renee as beneficiary. She qualifies as a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d under the statutory definition, since she is not the policyholder. The proceeds are therefore presumed to be protected from the creditors of Rick\u2019s estate. Also, since Renee is the spouse of the life insured (Rick), Renee is also within the protected class of beneficiaries.

The claimant must: Provide satisfactory evidence that the life insured has died; Prove he/she is entitled to the death benefit. No claims process is exactly the same. Therefore, it is important for the agent to become familiar with the insurance company\u2019s claims process as a claim could be challenged if the agent has not gathered all the right information in the application process and asked all the right questions. 3.1.1 Claimant \u00b6 When a life insured dies, the claimant is the one who initiates a claim for any insurance benefits payable. The claimant can be: The insured; The insured\u2019s estate; A designated beneficiary (either a primary or contingent beneficiary); The assignee of an insurance policy or death benefit; A creditor. Under certain circumstances, a court order may allow a creditor to claim an insurance benefit. For example, if ordered by a judge, as part of a spousal or child support obligation. The insurer must make sure that any money owed is paid to the estate and/or beneficiaries. If any disputes occur, the insurer has the choice to pay the benefit directly to the court. 3.1.2 Insurer\u2019s records \u00b6 An insurance policyholder should make sure the appropriate beneficiary designation is properly filed with the insurer. Benefits are paid to the most recent beneficiary designation on file with the insurer; If there is no beneficiary designation on file, benefits are paid to the estate. Policyholders may also specify beneficiary designations through their will. If this is the case, the most recent beneficiary filed with the insured may not be the claimant. Life Insurance, Accident & Sickness Insurance and Annuity Claims \u2013 Payment of Proceeds 3.1.3 Notice of claim \u00b6 When an insured person dies, it is typically the life insurance agent, the estate executor or trustee, a beneficiary or the employer who notifies the insurance company. The insurance agent often helps the insurer to locate the named beneficiary and help them complete the claim form. In many cases, the beneficiary is known to the insurance agent as beneficiaries are often one of the family members or a close friend to the policyholder, a business partner, or a charity; However, sometimes the beneficiary is not aware that he or she is the beneficiary; It can sometimes be difficult for the insurance agent to contact the beneficiary when little information is provided about the beneficiary. If the insurance company no longer exists, the family must seek out the insurer that took over the deceased\u2019s policy. CLHIA is a useful resource in these circumstances. Upon receiving a notice of death, the insurer will stop taking premiums and will wait to receive a claim. The insurer will contact the agent who has serviced the deceased. Time limits on making a claim vary among provinces and is often included in the life insurance policy. Time limits are: Generally stated in the life insurance policy; and Governed by provincial and territorial insurance and limitation period legislation. Relief for the beneficiary or the state executor from claim time limits may be granted by the Courts in specific situations where relief is deemed to be fair. In some jurisdictions, some type of benefits may become unclaimed property, and the insurer may be required to remit those benefits to the government. 3.1.4 Proof of claim \u00b6 The agent plays an important role in establishing proof at the time of a claim. The information needed to prove the claim must concur with the information gathered by the agent during the application process. 3.1.4.1 Documents required \u00b6 Beneficiaries must complete a claim form. Agents, beneficiaries the estate executor or trustee may obtain the form directly from the insurer. The insurer determines if the claim is payable once the completed form with the correct information is received. If the claim is payable, the insurer pays the claimant if that person is entitled to it. To satisfy the policy\u2019s terms the claimant needs to prove that: The identity of the person who died is the same as the life insured under the policy; The insured has died; The insured person\u2019s age; The claimant\u2019s right to receive the benefit; The claimant\u2019s age, name and identity. Death is usually confirmed with a funeral director\u2019s declaration of death or a provincial death certificate. However, the insurer may require further evidence if the person died in suspicious circumstances. For example, if the person died in a foreign country or was lost at sea and the body was never recovered. 3.1.4.2 Probate \u00b6 Insurers do not require probate in all cases, but they still require evidence of the claimant\u2019s right to receive payment. 3.1.4.3 Proof of age \u00b6 Typically, proof of age is usually established at the time of application. Premiums are calculated using the insured\u2019s true age. If this is the case, the insurer will often admit the claim without further proof of age. Because some term coverage expires at a certain age, proof of true age is required. 3.1.4.4 Proof of identity \u00b6 A named beneficiary will need to provide satisfactory proof of identity. A beneficiary who has changed their name (such as in marriage) to provide appropriate documentation. Beneficiaries described in terms of relationship (e.g., children) or representative status (e.g., executors) will have to prove their qualifications by providing additional documentary evidence or a court order to appoint them. 3.1.4.5 Accidental vs. natural causes \u00b6 In most cases of life insurance, there are little to no restrictions or limitations regarding the cause of death. If limitations are in place, the insurer may investigate whether the policy is applicable as well as require a more detailed physician\u2019s statement of death or, in some cases, a coroner\u2019s autopsy or toxicology report. The following are common limitations on cause of death: Suicide \u2013 generally a policy will not pay the death benefit if the death is due to suicide within a specific duration (typically in the first two years) of when a policy takes effect. The insurer may request a more detailed proof of death to confirm or dismiss suicide. After the initial 2 to 3-year period, death by suicide would likely be covered and the insurer would pay the death benefit; High-risk activities \u2013 an exclusion clause may be included in the policy stating that the death benefit will not be paid in cases where the death is associated with a high-risk activity such as scuba diving or hang gliding; Accidental death - accidental death policies only pay a death benefit when death is caused by an accident. In this case, the insurer would require proof that death was accidental and occurred through external and accidental means. Example Luis was pronounced dead at the scene of a serious motorcycle accident. Forensic and witness evidence gathered at the scene established that his vehicle had very gradually veered to the right, but travelled at the same speed until the collision, with no evidence of braking or turning. The coroner ordered an autopsy because his death was unexplained and apparently an accident. Suicide was ruled out and it was determined that Luis died of natural causes because he suffered a sudden, massive heart attack while driving. He therefore died before the motorcycle accident. His life insurance paid a benefit, but his beneficiary was not entitled to the additional accidental death benefit. 3.2 Disappearance and Presumption of Death \u00b6 If an insured person has disappeared and remains missing for seven years or more, a request can be made (typically by the family) to the Court to declare the person dead to obtain life insurance proceeds. It is important to determine the time of death. If a policy has lapsed due to non-payment of premiums since the insured person disappeared, the insurer would typically require proof that the death occurred while the policy was still in force before making any benefit payment. Example Namita was flying to Europe on holiday. Her plane was destroyed by an explosion 35,000 feet in the air over the Atlantic and very little was recoverable by search teams. Unfortunately, there was no trace of Namita; however, the airline\u2019s records confirmed that she had cleared the gate and boarded the plane. A judge had no difficulty concluding that Namita died the day the plane crash occurred. Since she was declared dead by a court, her life insurance policy benefit became payable as of the date of the plane crash. 3.2.1 Death of two or more people \u00b6 When there are multiple deaths, the time and sequence of deaths may be important in determining who is entitled to the insurance proceeds. Joint life insurance policies that insure more than one person \u2013 the benefit is paid upon the death of the first or the second insured person. If it is impossible to know who died first, the policy may state who is presumed to have died first. Time of death is also important in some circumstances to establish if the life insured died before or after the beneficiary. Example Peter was staying over at his mother Magda\u2019s house. They had separate rooms on the second floor. In the middle of the night, the furnace malfunctioned, filling the house with carbon monoxide. In the morning, both Peter and Magda were found dead in their beds. Based on medical testimony at the inquest, the judge was able to conclude that Peter, although younger, had probably died first, as he was a smoker and had respiratory problems, leading to more rapid breathing than his mother, who was fit and healthy despite her age. Peter and his sister were joint beneficiaries of Magda\u2019s life insurance; since he predeceased Magda, his sister inherited the entire death benefit. If Peter had been found to have outlived his mother, he would have been entitled to his half-share of her insurance which would have been dealt with through his estate. 3.3 Payment into Court \u00b6 In cases where the insurance company is faced with conflicting claims of beneficiary entitlement, the insurer may make the payment into Court. By doing so, the insurer has no further liability, and the Courts can determine entitlement to the insurance proceeds. When a minor is a beneficiary, some provincial statutes require the benefit to be payable to the Court to protect the minor\u2019s interests. 3.4 Proceeds on Deposit and Payout Options \u00b6 Policy settlement options refer to the payout options available for payment of the death benefit. Typically, claimants would choose their preferred payment option on the same form they complete to establish their right to the death benefit. Life insurance policies provide several options for the payment of a death benefit. However, specified transfer or payout rules are often applicable to retirement products. These rules state that amounts be transferred to specified retirement products. Generally, the insurer is told to send the death benefit to the estate lawyer, estate executor or beneficiary. The insurer usually pays the death benefit in a single, lump sum amount in the form of a cheque to the beneficiary or to the estate executor who would then have full control over the disposition of the benefit. Transfers of any amounts which are locked in for retirement purposes would have transfer options limited to those entitled under applicable legislation. To adequately assist clients, agents should be aware of any applicable payout option limitations. 3.5 Time to Pay Claim \u00b6 The insurer is obligated, by law, to pay a claim within 30 days of receiving satisfactory proof that the claim is valid and payable. The insurer is not obligated to pay interest on an unpaid claim although, in practice, many do. The value of segregated funds regularly fluctuates based on the performance of their underlying investments. Thus, the death benefit under a segregated fund contract must be determined after death. 3.6 Denial of Claim \u00b6 Even when a beneficiary is properly identified, there are three main reasons why an insurer may refuse to pay a death benefit claim: Fraud; When payment of a death benefit goes against public order; and Lapse (default of payment) of the insurance policy. During the application process, the agent must check the information provided by the applicant for any possible fraudulent information. A fourth motive could be that the claim was not made in a timely fashion according to applicable provincial legislation. In that case, an insurer could invoke the limitation period. 3.6.1 Payment contrary to public order \u00b6 The insured refuses payment to the beneficiary when the beneficiary intentionally causes the life insured\u2019s death. In such cases, payment would be considered a violation of community standards or \u201cpublic order.\u201d The insurer is bound by law under the insurance contract not to pay the death benefit in situations where it is considered unfair that the beneficiary should benefit from their wrongful act. Example Amit and Mary have been dating for two years when Amit decides to purchase life insurance on Mary\u2019s life. After a bitter argument, Amit pushes Mary off a cliff and Mary does not survive the fall. Amit is found guilty of first-degree murder, and the insurer is entitled to deny any benefits to Amit as such payments would be contrary to public order. 3.7 Accident and Sickness Claims \u00b6 Accident and sickness insurance policies may pay benefits in a number of different situations, including accidental injury, dismemberment, accidental death, disability, or critical illness. Insurance law allows for \u201cimperfect compliance\u201d with the claims process in the case of an accidental injury claim, as it is sometimes difficult for the injured person to complete the requirements due to the injury. 3.7.1 Accident death and dismemberment claims \u00b6 A policyholder can name a beneficiary under an accidental death and dismemberment insurance policy: If the accidental injury causes loss (for example, the loss of a leg), the benefit would typically be paid to the policyholder; If the accident causes death, the benefit would be paid to the named beneficiary; If there is no beneficiary, the benefit is paid to the policyholder or his/her estate. 3.7.1.1 Documents required \u00b6 The insurance company provides the necessary forms required to support a claim. In some cases, medical evidence from a physician may also be required. Where a person is so injured that they cannot complete the claim form, relief for partial or non-compliance with the claims process is provided for under provincial and territorial insurance law. 3.7.2 Disability claims \u00b6 Disability occurs when due to an accident or illness the insured can no longer work full-time or continue in their regular occupation. Disability insurance helps to protect against disability and the inability to work due to either mental (i.e., depression, anxiety, etc.) or physical conditions. Disability insurance can be obtained through both individual and/or group plans. Disability insurance can protect against both short-term and long-term disabilities. The claimant must establish to the insurer that their condition meets the definition of disability stated in the insurance policy. Note that disability insurance is not unemployment insurance \u2013 whether or not the person can find a job is irrelevant under a disability insurance policy. 3.7.2.1 Documents required \u00b6 The claimant must provide satisfactory evidence of the disability to the insurance company to make a successful claim. The insurer is obligated to pay the claim based on the established evidence. Different policies set forth different definitions of disability. Thus, to receive a claim, the supporting documentation must match the benefit requirements stated in the insurance policy. The insurer specifies what documents are required to assess a claim \u2013 typically the insurer asks for a claimant\u2019s statement and an attending physician\u2019s statement (APS) from the doctor (physician). The APS is important because it determines the beginning of the insured\u2019s disability. The waiting period may be determined by the insurer from when the disability started using the date provided by the doctor. The insurer may ask for financial evidence to support a lost income claim due to disability. The receiver of the disability payments differs depending on who is the policyholder and who is the beneficiary. For example, the insured, who may be the life insured or another party (i.e., the employer), receives the benefit. A disability claim process typically involves the following steps: A period of total disability may be required before partial disability benefits are payable; Benefits are payable after satisfying the waiting period; Evidence is required to determine that the insured can no longer perform the duties or activities of their occupation; Periodic assessment of whether the claimant is still disabled; and Assessment regarding a claimant\u2019s recovery \u2013 if the claimant has recovered or not, and whether he or she will remain disabled of a permanent, total or partial nature. 3.7.2.2 Medical and other examinations \u00b6 When required, claims are typically based on medical evidence supplied by either a family doctor or specialist. The insurer may request additional medical evidence to validate and better understand the insured\u2019s disability. The insurer may pay for the insured to see additional specialists as part of the rehabilitation process of their disability. A physician, who is both specialized in the determined illness and licensed to practise medicine in Canada, must diagnose the insured with a critical illness or disease covered by the insurance policy for the claim to be made and valid. Critical illness (CI) insurance provides a lump-sum payment when the insured suffers a critical illness that is covered under the policy: In most cases, a lump-sum benefit is paid within 30 days of claim approval; Critical illness coverage ceases after the benefit has been paid; If the insured dies for an unrelated issue (i.e., not a critical illness), the premiums paid may be refunded to the named beneficiary. 3.8 Segregated Funds and Annuities \u00b6 When the life insured under an annuity contract dies, the beneficiary or the estate is usually entitled to a death benefit. However, it is not the case when the annuity contract was an immediate life annuity contract that has begun to pay benefits to the annuity grantee that had no guarantee period, or with a guarantee period that has passed. See Section 3.1.4 Proof of Claim, with regard to the death benefits owed by the insurer to the beneficiary or to the estate. Immediate or payout annuities may be purchased with a guarantee period. This means that if the person whose life is insured dies before the insurer has made a stipulated number of payments, the insurer remains obligated to continue payments. The annuity grantee (if not the same person as the annuitant) may receive the remaining payments, or may agree with the insurer to terminate the contract early and accept a commuted amount in the settlement of the policy. Amounts accrued in an annuity contract (segregated funds or GIAs) for pension purposes are generally referred to as locked in. In other words, when a pension plan is funded by a segregated fund, specific restrictions apply. The fund can only be transferred in accordance with applicable legislation as follows: A LIRA; Another pension plan; For the purchase of an immediate life annuity or a deferred life annuity; A LIF. 3.8.1 Death before retirement \u00b6 When a person receives a pension under a pension plan, the pension benefit becomes payable to the spouse if the person dies. Note that the spouse is entitled to the pension benefit even if the beneficiary is someone else. The spouse may be able to transfer the benefit into his/her own locked-in plan. If there is no eligible spouse, the named beneficiary would receive the pension benefit. The deceased pensioner\u2019s estate would receive the pension benefit if there is no named beneficiary. 3.8.2 Death after retirement \u00b6 A pensioner\u2019s eligible spouse may be entitled to a survivor\u2019s death benefit \u2013 this benefit is typically a reduced amount of the pensioner\u2019s former pension. If there is no eligible spouse, the named beneficiary will receive a commuted lump sum representing the remaining payments in the applicable guarantee (if any) period. If there is no named beneficiary, the deceased pensioner\u2019s estate.","title":"Chapter 3 Life Insurance Accident and Sickness Insurance and Annuity Claims"},{"location":"ethics/Chapter_3_Life_Insurance_Accident_and_Sickness/#chapter-3-life-insurance-accident-sickness-insurance-and-annuity-claims-payment-of-proceeds","text":"","title":"Chapter 3: Life Insurance, Accident &amp; Sickness Insurance and Annuity Claims \u2013 Payment of Proceeds"},{"location":"ethics/Chapter_3_Life_Insurance_Accident_and_Sickness/#31-rules-pertaining-to-claims-and-payment-of-benefits","text":"When a life insured dies or the policy matures, the claimant has to meet specifically stated requirements to receive the claim.

Under certain circumstances, a court order may allow a creditor to claim an insurance benefit. For example, if ordered by a judge, as part of a spousal or child support obligation.

The insurance agent often helps the insurer to locate the named beneficiary and help them complete the claim form. In many cases, the beneficiary is known to the insurance agent as beneficiaries are often one of the family members or a close friend to the policyholder, a business partner, or a charity; However, sometimes the beneficiary is not aware that he or she is the beneficiary; It can sometimes be difficult for the insurance agent to contact the beneficiary when little information is provided about the beneficiary. If the insurance company no longer exists, the family must seek out the insurer that took over the deceased\u2019s policy. CLHIA is a useful resource in these circumstances. Upon receiving a notice of death, the insurer will stop taking premiums and will wait to receive a claim. The insurer will contact the agent who has serviced the deceased. Time limits on making a claim vary among provinces and is often included in the life insurance policy. Time limits are: Generally stated in the life insurance policy; and Governed by provincial and territorial insurance and limitation period legislation. Relief for the beneficiary or the state executor from claim time limits may be granted by the Courts in specific situations where relief is deemed to be fair.

If limitations are in place, the insurer may investigate whether the policy is applicable as well as require a more detailed physician\u2019s statement of death or, in some cases, a coroner\u2019s autopsy or toxicology report. The following are common limitations on cause of death: Suicide \u2013 generally a policy will not pay the death benefit if the death is due to suicide within a specific duration (typically in the first two years) of when a policy takes effect. The insurer may request a more detailed proof of death to confirm or dismiss suicide. After the initial 2 to 3-year period, death by suicide would likely be covered and the insurer would pay the death benefit; High-risk activities \u2013 an exclusion clause may be included in the policy stating that the death benefit will not be paid in cases where the death is associated with a high-risk activity such as scuba diving or hang gliding; Accidental death - accidental death policies only pay a death benefit when death is caused by an accident. In this case, the insurer would require proof that death was accidental and occurred through external and accidental means. Example Luis was pronounced dead at the scene of a serious motorcycle accident. Forensic and witness evidence gathered at the scene established that his vehicle had very gradually veered to the right, but travelled at the same speed until the collision, with no evidence of braking or turning. The coroner ordered an autopsy because his death was unexplained and apparently an accident. Suicide was ruled out and it was determined that Luis died of natural causes because he suffered a sudden, massive heart attack while driving. He therefore died before the motorcycle accident.

These high standards are key to earning the public\u2019s trust in the insurance industry as well as in the profession of insurance agent. Therefore, demonstrating ethical conduct and giving constructive advice is very important in terms of building a trusting relationship between the life insurance agent and client. Ethical conduct refers to: Managing cases of conflict of interest; Client needs analysis; Selling ethically; Meeting fiduciary duties; and Satisfying statutes, regulations and codes of conduct. Agents can receive fines and/or lose their licence for breaking industry rules. It is important that insurance agents have a clear understanding of the important concepts and factual examples outlined in this chapter. The information provided in this chapter demonstrates the high ethical standards expected of the agent when conducting business. 4.1 Role of the Organizations that Protect Clients \u00b6 This section: Examines the principal regulatory authorities relating to life insurance agents as well as other significant client protection organizations; and Lays out the regulatory framework regarding life insurance agent conduct (and accident and sickness insurance agent conduct) in Canada, which now is increasingly focused on more proactive as opposed to reactive supervision. 4.1.1 Provincial and territorial regulatory authorities \u00b6 Regulations for insurance companies are legislated and instituted by the federal, provincial and territorial governments. Rules and Principles Governing the Activities of Life Insurance Agents and Accident & Sickness Insurance Agents Under the supervision of Insurance Companies Act, as well as the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), the federal government is responsible for overseeing and determining \u201cthe financial soundness\u201d of federally incorporated life insurance companies. The provincial and territorial governments are responsible for: Determining the financial soundness of the provincially or territorially incorporated life insurance companies; The licensing of insurance agents in the respective provinces and territories; Overseeing the licensing of insurance companies operating within their jurisdictions as well as the marketing of insurance products; and Regulating market conduct. According to the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators (CCIR), both the provincial and territorial governments are responsible for regulating market conduct. Regulating market conduct refers to the overseeing \u201cof any product or service relationship between the insurance industry, insurers, agents, clients and the public.\u201d Market conduct \u201cis influenced by many factors such as laws, established best practices, codes of conduct, and client expectations.\u201d According to the CCIR, risk-based regulation is an important priority. This refers to regulation, which directs the regulator\u2019s efforts at those issues which could potentially negatively impact on clients. This approach is used \u201cto focus regulatory attention on insurers where indicators suggest there is a high risk of non-compliance with the legislation rather than giving every insurer equal weight and examining them all.\u201d In other words, breaches of compliance systematically generate increased supervision by regulators. Regulatory authorities must ensure fair, responsible and professional conduct by life insurance agents. They fulfill their mandate by setting expectations and requirements for regulating the conduct of life insurance agents towards clients, including: Promoting transparency to clients; Taking enforcement actions against breaches of conduct; Equipping clients with financial knowledge and skills (i.e., understanding financial concepts and terminology); Giving clients access to independent complaint resolution avenues, such as the OmbudService for Life and Health Insurance. 4.1.2 Provincial and territorial insurance regulators \u00b6 There are 10 provincial and 3 territorial regulators that are responsible for the licensing and regulation of insurance agents and agencies. Note that OSFI is not responsible for licensing, regulating or supervising an insurance agent\u2019s practice. For links to the regulatory authorities\u2019 websites, visit: http://www.cisro-ocra.com/ . 4.1.2.1 British Columbia \u00b6 The Insurance Council of British Columbia licenses life insurance agents, corporate agencies and accident and sickness insurance agents. The Financial Institution Commission of British Columbia issues business authorizations to insurance companies. The Financial Institutions Act, the Rules of Insurance Council of British Columbia and the Code of Conduct of the Insurance Council of British Columbia govern life insurance agents and accident and sickness insurance agents.

The Insurance Act governs life insurance agents and accident and sickness insurance agents. 4.1.3 Canadian Insurance Services Regulatory Organizations (CISRO) \u00b6 The Canadian Insurance Services Regulatory Organizations (CISRO) is \u201can inter-jurisdictional group of regulating authorities who are dedicated to developing consistent standards of qualifications and practice for insurance intermediaries dealing in insurance of persons and property.\u201d The key function of CISRO is to administer the regulatory system applicable to insurance intermediaries. CISRO members cannot enact legislation. However, CISRO members act as key advisors regarding insurance intermediaries to their respective provincial and territorial governments. Maintaining transparency regarding disciplinary actions taken by insurance regulators is important for the industry and client. The CISRO website includes disciplinary actions taken by insurance regulators on their site. One can access the CISRO website at: http://www.cisro-ocra.com/ . Through the Joint Forum of Financial Market Regulators, regulatory authorities work with other authorities and agencies and maintain a dialogue with clients\u2019 associations to constructively discuss issues faced by the life insurance buying public. In September 2018, CISRO, in collaboration with CCIR, has published a Guidance entitled Conduct of Insurance Business and fair treatment of Customers, which applies to insurers as well as well as insurance intermediaries (individual agents, brokers and representatives). 4.1.4 Other authorities providing client protection \u00b6 Several other authorities protect the client. Those following most relevant to the activities of a life insurance agent are listed below and are discussed in this section: Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada; Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC); Assuris; OmbudService for Life and Health Insurance (OLHI); Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators (CCIR). 4.1.4.1 Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada \u00b6 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada\u2019s mission and mandate is to administer enforcement of the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada\u2019s role is to \u201cprotect and promote the privacy rights of individuals.\u201d1 PIPEDA oversees the information managing practices of private sector organizations everywhere in Canada except, British Columbia, Alberta and Qu\u00e9bec as well as the health-care sector of Ontario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador. In all of Canada, PIPEDA continues to apply to the federally regulated private sector. Life insurance agents working in British Columbia, Alberta and Qu\u00e9bec must follow the personal information protection act of their own provinces. Life insurance agents must keep client information confidential and secure. Example Nancy, a licensed life insurance agent in Manitoba, kept her client files in an unlocked cabinet in her office or on her computer, which had her password taped to the keyboard. Her office was broken into, her files rifled and her computer stolen. Nancy did not comply with PIPEDA. She should have made sure the files were kept in a secure place. 4.1.4.2 Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) \u00b6 FINTRAC helps protect the integrity of the Canadian financial system by ensuring life insurance agents comply with regulation outlined in Canada\u2019s Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act. Life insurance agents have a responsibility to report suspicious transactions and terrorist property. The agent\u2019s role under Canada\u2019s Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act is to focus on the four following areas: Ascertaining each client\u2019s identity and confirming the existence of entities; Third-party determination; Determination of the purpose; Determination of politically exposed persons and heads of international organizations; Obligation to report suspicious transactions, terrorist property and large cash transactions. Ascertaining each client\u2019s identity Under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Regulations and FINTRAC\u2019s Guidances, the life insurance agent is required to establish a client\u2019s identity who: Is purchasing an immediate or deferred annuity; or Is purchasing a life insurance policy that is not an exempt policy, towards which the client can pay a minimum of $10,000 during the annuity or policy, regardless of the payment method. Exempted products consist of: Individual or group registered retirement income plans (RRSP, RRIF, LIRA, LIF, DPSP, RPP, and TFSA); Exempt life insurance policies; and Health or accident insurance policies with no cash surrender value (CSV). It is important for the agent to record the information covered by these laws in the client information record. While the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act does not require agents to ascertain the client\u2019s identity for certain products, the insurer has obligations under the Act that may require the agent to ascertain the client\u2019s identity. Also, confirming the identity of a client can ensure that the client\u2019s age has been accurately reported or that the insurer has acted in accordance with its obligations under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). FATCA is an American law intended to prevent tax evasion by U.S. residents and citizens who hold accounts outside of the U.S. Non-registered plans The agent is obligated to ascertain each holder, owner and joint holder\u2019s identity in person. The client must bring an identification document with a unique identifier number from a provincial, territorial or federal government. Originals of the following are acceptable identification documents which the client may use to prove their identity: Government-issued photo identification method where the document must be authentic, valid and current; Credit file method where the information must be valid and current; or; Dual-process method where the information must be valid and current and from different sources. FINTRAC\u2019s Guidance also indicates how to identify the identity of an individual when the agent is not physically in presence of the individual he has to identify. An insurance agent can use an individual\u2019s provincial health card, but only if it is not prohibited by provincial or territorial legislation. The insurance agent may use a social insurance card to verify the identity of a client, but a social insurance number may not be used in a declaration made to FINTRAC. Most insurers refuse that insurance agents use a social insurance card to verify the identity of a client. Confirming the existence of the entity and identifying the beneficial owners Individual or group insurance for an entity The agent is obligated to ascertain the client\u2019s identity if the client is a corporation or another type of entity. The client must then provide sufficient proof of identity, such as a corporate status certificate and the names of the directors. The client must provide the insurer with the name, date of birth and information on the authorized signatories of the corporation or entity (i.e., company, not-for-profit organization, estates, trusts, etc.). Individual or group insurance for an entity other than an estate or trust The client must provide the insurer with all of the individuals\u2019 names owning a share of the entity along with the home address and professional details on individuals who control 25% or more of the entity. The agent must collect additional information if the client is a legal person (company) or another form of entity, such as the ultimate beneficiaries of the entity (the identity of the individuals who ultimately control the legal person or other form of entity). This cannot be another legal person or entity. Typically, insurance forms state what information to request. When the client is a legal person (company) or another form of entity, the insurance agent must also confirm and retain the information on the ultimate beneficiaries of the entity, or, in other words, the identity of the individuals who ultimately control the legal person or other form of entity (beneficial ownership), which cannot be another legal person or entity. These obligations include: obtaining information that describes the ownership, control and structure of the entity, including corporations and trusts; and if the entity is a corporation, obtaining the names of all the directors, as well as the names and addresses of the beneficial owners; if the entity is a trust, obtaining the names and addresses of all trustees and known beneficiaries and settlors of the trust; if the entity is other than a corporation or trust, obtaining the names and addresses of the beneficial owners; and taking reasonable measures to confirm the accuracy of the information obtained, and keeping records of the information obtained and the measures taken to confirm its accuracy. If an entity is a not-for-profit organization, the life insurance agent must also determine if the entity is a registered charity under the Income Tax Act or if it is an unregistered not-for-profit organization that solicits charitable donations from the public. Third-party determination The agent must verify, with certainty, the identity of the individual who is submitting the insurance application. A third-party determination form must be completed if the person applying for insurance is acting on behalf of a third party (for example, a power of attorney). The third-party denomination form must specify the following: If the third party is an individual - the individual\u2019s name, address, date of birth and nature of his principal business or occupation (if the third party is an individual); If the third party is an entity - its name, address and nature of its principal business; If the third party is a corporation - its incorporation number and place of incorporation; and The nature of the relationship between the insured and the person completing the application (the third party). In some cases, the insurance agent has reasonable grounds to suspect that the individual is acting on behalf of a third party but cannot determine it in the typical way described above. In this case, the individual or entity must keep a document that: According to the client, states if the transaction is being conducted on behalf of a third party; and Outlines the reasonable grounds to suspect that the client is indeed acting on behalf of a third party. Determination of politically exposed persons (PEP) and heads of international organizations (HIO) A life insurance agent must take reasonable measures to determine if a person is a foreign PEP, a domestic PEP, a HIO, or the family member or close associate of one of these, if the person makes a lump-sum payment of $100,000 or more towards an immediate or deferred annuity or life insurance policy, on their own behalf or at the instruction of someone else. A life insurance agent must also take reasonable measures to establish the source of funds for the lump-sum transaction for these persons. Reasonable measures include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following actions: asking the client; conducting an open source search; or consulting a source of commercially available information. Determination of the purpose Since February 1, 2014, the client must indicate the purpose of the product they are purchasing. Obligation to report suspicious transactions Suspicious transactions (attempted or completed) must be reported by the agent to FINTRAC as soon as practicable after the agent\u2019s first suspicion. If an agent suspects that a transaction (or group of transactions) constitutes money laundering or used to finance terrorist activities, the agent must report the transaction (or group of transactions). Note that the intention to conduct a suspicious transaction should also be reported. These are some suspicious transaction indicators that an agent is most likely to notice: The client refuses to provide the required identification documents and seeks to establish his identity through means other than identification documents or unreasonably delays submitting company documents; The client acts withdrawn or anxious, explains himself in a strange way or is monitored or accompanied by another individual; The client shows unusual curiosity about internal controls or unusual knowledge of legislation on suspicious transaction reporting; The client deposits third-party cheques for very large amounts; The client is more interested in the ramifications of a product\u2019s termination than its long-term benefits; The transaction is disproportionally complicated for its purpose; The transaction is not in line with the client\u2019s apparent financial situation or strange activities; and The client provides a P.O. Box in an area where P.O. Boxes are not generally used (i.e., cities). Note that failure to comply with this protocol can lead to serious criminal charges against the agent. On the other hand, if suspicious transactions are reported in a timely fashion and in good faith, the agent is protected against legal action. Obligation to report terrorist property When the life Insurance agent knows that property in Is possession or under his control is owned, controlled by or on behalf of a terrorist or a terrorist group, the life Insurance agent must submit a report without delay. The life Insurance agent must also submit a report to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). Obligation to report large cash transaction Requirements also apply to large cash transactions, such as a single deposit of $10,000 or more, or two or more $10,000 deposits within a 24-hour period. Insurers, however, rarely accept cash payments. When a client purchasing a policy makes a deposit of $100,000 or more, in any payment form, the agent must check whether the client is a politically exposed foreign person. The agent has 15 days after the transaction to report this type of client. Generally, a politically exposed foreign person is someone who has held a government or legal position in a foreign country, or is the spouse or a close family member of this individual. Insurance forms contain information on this subject. 4.1.4.3 Assuris \u00b6 Assuris is a not-for-profit organization whose mandate is to protect Canadian policyholders in the event that their life insurance company should fail. Life insurance agents must have a clear understanding of what would occur if an insurance company would become bankrupt. Clients are automatically covered under Assuris as all federal and most provincially regulated insurance companies must be a part of Assuris. In the case of insolvency, the insurer\u2019s primary regulator would appoint a liquidator. The liquidator would try to: First, transfer the policies to other insurance companies; Then, reduce benefits (if necessary). If benefits were reduced, Assuris protection would be applicable. Assuris protection limits are outlined in the table below: 4.1.4.4 OmbudService for Life and Health Insurance (OLHI) \u00b6 OmbudService for Life and Health Insurance (OLHI) is a national independent complaint resolution organization. OLHI assists insurance clients with their enquiries and complaints regarding Canadian life and health insurance products and services. In some cases, the OLHI may direct life insurance agent complaints to the relevant insurers. 4.1.4.5 Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators (CCIR) \u00b6 The Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators (CCIR) is an inter-jurisdictional association of insurance regulators. CCIR\u2019s mandate is \u201cto facilitate and promote an efficient and effective insurance regulatory system in Canada to serve the public interest.\u201d2 Under the CCIR\u2019s management, a risk-based framework for industry market conduct regulation has been adopted by the Canadian insurance regulators. This framework prioritizes issues based on importance and their potential impact (risk) to the achievement of desired regulatory outcomes. In managing key risks to clients, the regulatory authorities\u2019 priorities are being directed at: Strengthening the foundation of market conduct; Putting in place an enhanced market conduct supervisory framework; Enhancing the effectiveness of insurance intermediaries\u2019 supervision; Helping clients through directed financial education program such as fraud alerts and client information portals. According to the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators (CCIR), companies or intermediaries potentially have an impact in their regions or on their respective customers, but a greater impact can be developed by the adoption of measures or regulations applicable to the industry as a whole. 4.1.5 Professional associations \u00b6 By promoting professional qualifications, professional development, ethical behaviour, and the fair treatment of clients, the following organizations encourage the professionalism of life insurance agents: Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association (CLHIA); Advocis; Independent Financial Brokers of Canada (IFB); Canadian Association of Independent Life Brokerage Agencies (CAILBA); Financial Planners Standards Council (FPSC). 4.1.6 International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) \u00b6 The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is an organization representing insurance regulators from over 200 jurisdictions in almost 140 countries. The IAIS has established 26 Insurance Core Principles (ICPs) to promote and provide, \u201cglobally consistent supervision of the insurance industry and contributing to global financial stability.\u201d3 CISRO and the CCIR ensure that the Canadian regulatory system meets all internationally agreed upon standards as well as to keep informed on emerging issues that may be identified outside Canada. 4.1.6.1 Insurance core principles (ICP) 18 and 19 of the IAIS \u00b6 ICP 18 - entitled \u201cIntermediaries,\u201d covers the supervision of life insurance agents. ICP 19 - entitled \u201cConduct of business,\u201d covers the activities and behaviour of life insurance agents. The rules discussed in both of these ICPs are demonstrated in the past codes of conduct of most of the regulatory authorities and insurance companies aiming to safeguard clients and hold up their best interests. 4.2 Main Responsibilities of Life Insurance Agents \u00b6 This section demonstrates: The key responsibilities of life insurance agents; and The business conduct framework that agents must work within. This framework abides by the provincial insurance acts and the codes of conduct required by regulators, insurers and industry associations. Ethics and professionalism are key for insurance agents. All agents must abide by the principles and rules put in place by applicable legislation, codes of conduct, and contractual documents. Non-compliance can lead to stiff penalties, which include fines and/or a loss of the agent\u2019s licence. Principals and rules are imposed by all of the codes of conduct across Canada: Principles motivate or encourage behaviour, for example, to \u201cact in good faith\u201d; Rules prohibit or sanction behaviour (for example, forgery is prohibited). Table 4.2 illustrates the differences between principles and rules according to the Ontario Insurance Act Regulations. - An agent\u2019s conduct, practices and decisions should be guided by following these principles and rules: - Act in good faith; - Manage conflicts of interest properly; - Refrain from unfair or deceptive practices; - Make full disclosure; - Act in compliance of regulation; - Handle complaints in a timely and fair manner. 4.2.1 Acting in good faith \u00b6 Acting in good faith refers to acting in line with the client\u2019s best interests. Acting in good faith is key to an agent\u2019s business conduct as well as a key element in the relevant code of conduct and ethics. Acting in good faith consists of: Duty of care; Integrity; Competence. 4.2.1.1 Duty of care \u00b6 Duty of care refers to the obligation and accountability of life insurance agents to avoid negligent acts or omissions. According to the Code of Conduct from the Life Insurance Council of Alberta, duty of care refers to the fact that an agent must always put the client\u2019s interests ahead of his own. Example After meeting with a client and completing the life application, Erica, a life insurance agent was in a rush to leave on a long weekend trip. She locked the application and initial premium in her desk drawer. However, she forgot to submit the application after the long weekend. It was not until a few weeks later when the client enquired about the status of the application that she remembered it was still inside the drawer. Erica\u2019s action did not meet the standard of care expected of an agent, as she did not put her client\u2019s interests first. 4.2.1.2 Integrity \u00b6 Integrity is an essential characteristic of a life insurance agent. Acting with integrity includes: Being honest, trustworthy and fair; Being reliable, dependable and respectful. According to the Insurance Council of Manitoba\u2019s Code of Conduct, if an agent lacks personal integrity, it is very difficult for an agent to make up for its lacking or restore the damage to his or her reputation. Example Felicity, an insurance agent, helped a client apply for a multimillion-dollar permanent policy and collected the $100,000 annual premium with the application. Felicity believed that the permanent policy was not suitable for the client\u2019s needs (without discussing it with her client) but proceeded with the application at the client\u2019s request, as she was only interested in the commission she would receive from the insurer. Through her behaviour, Felicity demonstrated a lack of integrity. 4.2.1.3 Competence \u00b6 Agents should be aware of their own limits of expertise, and should only offer products, services, and advice for which they have the required skills and competence. Agents should either ask for help or refer the client to a colleague when they are faced with a situation where they do not possess the necessary skills and/or knowledge required to offer advice. According to the Insurance Council of British Columbia, \u201cincompetent conduct can result in significant prejudice to clients and insurers.\u201d Example Sandra, a life insurance agent, does not have experience in annuity products. She tells Amel, a prospective client, that she could prepare a customized proposal for a back-to-back insured annuity. This strategy, she says, will increase the client\u2019s guaranteed stream of income at retirement while minimizing the tax payable. Sandra has committed to provide information on a complex transaction without understanding what is involved. Sandra should have just told Amel that she would obtain the technical assistance needed from colleagues in her agency. Together, they could have prepared a proposal that would have met the needs expressed by the client. The combination of care, integrity and competence assist in creating the life agent\u2019s reputation and achieve the marketplace outcome regarding the fair treatment of clients. 4.2.2 Managing conflicts of interest \u00b6 A conflict of interest refers to a situation where the life agent\u2019s interests do not align with the client\u2019s interests. For example, when the life insurance agent seeks a personal financial gain through his or her actions even though that action does not coincide with the client\u2019s needs. Conflict of interest is not consistent with the regulatory expectations that clients should be treated in a fair way. Any possible conflicts of interest are required to be disclosed and managed appropriately before a life insurance agent provides a client with advice or the client agrees on an insurance contract. CCIR and CISRO require that agents address the following principles outlined below: Priority of client\u2019s interest; Disclosure of conflicts or potential conflicts of interest; Product suitability. 4.2.2.1 Priority of client\u2019s interest \u00b6 Agents must always place the client\u2019s interests ahead of their own. According to the Insurance Council of Manitoba\u2019s Code of Conduct, a life insurance agent must: Not discriminate against the client\u2019s interests for personal gain; Not take advantage of a client\u2019s lack of experience or poor health. Example Martha, a group insurance agent, is married to Roberto, VP of Group Insurance Sales at a prominent Life insurance company. Though she acts as an agent for several Life Insurance companies, she often feels compelled to recommend Roberto\u2019s employer, as she knows that sales for Roberto\u2019s company may affect Roberto\u2019s performance bonus. In such a situation, Martha is in a conflict of interest. 4.2.2.2 Disclosure of conflicts or potential conflicts of interest \u00b6 According to the Insurance Council of Manitoba\u2019s Code of Conduct: The agent must explicitly disclose any and all conflicts of interest (actual or potential) to the client; The agent must not place himself in a conflict of interest unless the client explicitly agrees to the intended conduct. Example Patrick is a life insurance agent and also the majority owner of Cuppies, the most successful cupcake shop in town. Sal plans to open a similar shop across the street from Cuppies and wants to obtain insurance on the life of his pastry chef. To do so, he contacts Patrick, whom he only knows as an insurance agent. At their first meeting, Patrick must disclose his majority stake in Cuppies. 4.2.2.3 Product suitability \u00b6 Need-based sales practices refer to the agent making the best possible recommendations for potential clients. An agent must first understand the client\u2019s situation, and any advice or product recommendation must be suitable for the client. Agents must be able to demonstrate that they have understood the needs of the client, and that they have put the client\u2019s interests first. According to the Alberta Code of Conduct, a life insurance agent must: Perform a client needs analysis by gathering all the necessary facts required to assess them; Recommend products in line with the client\u2019s needs; Explain and document the product(s) recommended. Industry associations have together developed the best practices for determining product suitability during a typical individual life insurance sales process with a client. They are listed below in order: Disclosure to client; Client expectations; Fact-finding; Needs assessment; Recommendations and advice; Product information. 4.2.2.4 Avoiding conflict-of-interest occupations \u00b6 Agents must not be involved in any business or occupation that would threaten the agent\u2019s integrity, independence or competence. Typically, this is part of the agent\u2019s licensing requirements. Regulators can restrict other employment activities for life insurance agents. For example, agents are not allowed to simultaneously serve as clergymen, liquor store employees or police officers. According to the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, \u201cthe individual must not be in a position to use coercion or undue influence to control, direct or secure insurance business.\u201d Example Justin works part-time as an independent insurance agent. He is also enrolled as a student to complete the education and training courses required to become a police officer. Following completion of his police officer training, Justin is surprised to learn that employment as a police officer may be incompatible with the activities of an insurance agent. After checking with his provincial regulator, he is told that he may not simultaneously act as an insurance agent and be employed as a police officer, as the latter carries the possibility of exercising undue influence or even coercion when securing insurance business. 4.2.3 Refraining from unfair or deceptive practices \u00b6 Certain practices are prohibited by provincial and territorial regulators that are deemed unfair, misleading or deceptive. The sections that follow describe the most prevalent prohibited practices. The following are also described in most codes of conduct, insurance acts and industry guidelines: Tied selling; Churning and twisting; Premium rebating; Trafficking in insurance; Inducing to insure; Fronting; Unnecessary delay in delivering policies; Misrepresentation; Misappropriating client funds (commingling of funds); Making a false document (forgery); Holding out improperly; Misusing company-provided illustrations; and Defamation. 4.2.3.1 Tied selling \u00b6 Tied selling refers to making a purchase of one product conditional on the purchase of another. This practice is not allowed because the transaction is more advantageous for the agent than to the client. According to the life insurance and accident and sickness insurance agents\u2019 Code of Conduct of Manitoba, \u201cit is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for an agent or broker to assist in or engage in the practice of tied selling.\u201d Example Annick, a life insurance agent representing a single insurer, tells Gary, her client, that he qualifies for a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) loan. However, Annick tells Gary the loan is conditional on Gary transferring his current RRSPs into products offered by the life insurance company that Annick represents. This untrue and deceptive, but Gary trusts Annick and does as she suggests. Annick should never have made one transaction conditional on the purchase of another product or service. This is unethical behaviour as she is the only person to benefit from the transaction. 4.2.3.2 Churning and twisting \u00b6 Churning is when an agent recommends a client cancel one product to purchase another (usually from the same insurer) in order to generate commission. This is a prohibited practice. According to the CLHIA Guidelines churning is an \u201cunacceptable sales practice.\u201d Example Christine replaced an agent who had retired. In order to take advantage of her new clients for her own benefit, she advised one of them that he should buy a term annuity with his existing registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) to provide income, and reinvest the portion he did not need in an individual variable insurance contract (IVIC). Christine earned a commission on both the purchase of the annuity and the investment in the IVIC. A relative of the client discovered what had happened and complained to the insurer, who terminated Christine\u2019s contract. The client subsequently sued Christine and the insurer. Twisting is when an agent recommends a client cancel one product to purchase another (usually from a different insurer) in order to generate commission from the new sale even though the sale typically does not benefit the client. The agent often withholds key information on the total consequences (i.e., financial loss) of cancelling their policy. This is a prohibited practice. According to the Independent Financial Brokers of Canada\u2019s (IFBC) code of ethics, agents must not recommend the replacement of any product unless it is in the best interest of the client. Example 1 Alexi\u2019s life insurance agent recommends that he replace his policy with a new one with a larger death benefit from another insurance company. He omitted to explain to Alexi that there are tax consequences in cancelling the current policy, which has a substantial cash value, assuming a new one will be issued. Furthermore, he neglects to inform Alexi about the new two-year incontestability clause and the new two-year suicide clause. Example 2 Shabbir had a three-year deferred annuity contract with one insurance company. An agent, licensed by a competing insurance company, told Shabbir to surrender that annuity and purchase one his company offered, which currently offered better rates and more stability. Shabbir was not told that the products were different, that there are exit fees or that the replacement product had higher investment risk. 4.2.3.3 Premium rebating \u00b6 Premium rebating refers to when an agent gives back (rebates) all or part of the premium paid by the client. This is a prohibited practice. According to the Insurance Act of Ontario, premium rebating is an \u201cunfair or deceptive act or practice\u201d when \u201ca person pays, allows or gives, directly or indirectly, a rebate of all or part of the premium stipulated by a policy to a person insured or applying for insurance.\u201d Example Irving met with his client\u2019s son Steven, to sell him a life insurance policy. Since Steven was reluctant to sign, Irving offered to pay the first premium. In effect, Irving was offering a rebate. Irving should not offer to pay the first premium as an incentive for clients to purchase. 4.2.3.4 Trafficking in insurance \u00b6 Trafficking is when an agent acts as a broker between a policyholder who wishes to sell a policy and another individual who wishes to buy a policy. A policyholder involved in trafficking insurance will often sell his policy to a third party because he has a sufficient amount of wealth to \u201cself-insure\u201d without paying additional premiums or the beneficiaries have passed away. This occurs typically with universal life (UL) or whole life policies and sometimes term insurance policies as well. This practice is highly discouraged by the industry and is prohibited in Newfoundland and Labrador. Some insurers also have a policy against trafficking in insurance and will stop working with an agent who participates in it. According to the Insurance Companies Act of Newfoundland and Labrador, \u201cA person other than an insurer or its authorized agent who advertises or holds himself or herself out as a purchaser of life insurance policies or of benefits under life insurance policies or who traffics or trades in life insurance policies for the purpose of procuring the sale, surrender, transfer, assignment, pledge or hypothecation of them to himself or herself or another person, is guilty of an offence.\u201d Example Jamie, an insurance agent who is also registered as a mutual fund salesperson, arranged the sale of viatical settlements (insurance policies assigned by terminally ill individuals to a corporation) to his clients. He is required to place all business through his employer, which he did not do, and made profit on the sales. This is an unethical and potentially illegal practice in some jurisdictions. 4.2.3.5 Inducing to insure \u00b6 Inducing to insure refers to when an agent offers a gift or some other form of payment to entice a client to purchase a product. This is a prohibited practice. Example 1 Lorraine is negotiating with a company\u2019s vice president to set up a group insurance plan. She learns that another agent has approached the person. She buys the vice-president a case of very expensive wine in the hope that he will agree to do business with her. Lorraine should not encourage the vice president to do business with her because of the gift she has offered. Example 2 Nadia offers Silvano, a potential client, a discount on a policy benefit. She recommends adding a term rider free of charge if he buys a permanent life insurance policy. This is prohibited. Nadia should not try to induce a client into buying insurance by offering riders free of charge. 4.2.3.6 Fronting \u00b6 Fronting refers to when an agent allows someone else to solicit and submit business under his/her name when the agent has not met the client and does not even know who the client is. This is a prohibited practice and agents who participate in fronting risk losing their licence and being left with substantial chargebacks. According to the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO) fronting refers to when: A licensed agent chooses to have a different agent who has nothing to do with the transaction sign as the agent of record or; An unlicensed individual organizes the business and has a licensed person sign on their behalf. For example, to save time and effort, an agent splits her commission with an unlicensed person who carries out and completes business transactions in the agent\u2019s name even though the agent has never met these clients. It is unwise and inappropriate for an agent to \u201cfront\u201d business generated by someone else. Agents should not allow themselves to be used by someone else. Keep in mind that if anything goes wrong, it is the agent who is accountable. Example Donald, the manager of the local office of an insurance company, recruits Abner to become a life insurance agent. Abner has not yet completed the licensing examinations; he is not licensed. However, he has approached a relative to buy a term policy and has brought the completed application and cheque for the first premium to Donald. Donald signs as agent of record and splits the commission with Abner. Donald should never have employed Abner without the approved licence nor signed him as agent of record and Abner should not have approached potential clients until he had obtained his licence. Donald risks having his licence revoked and Abner risks never being able to obtain a licence. 4.2.3.7 Unnecessary delay in delivering policies \u00b6 Unnecessary delay in delivering policies refers to when an agent holds or retains documents that should be delivered to the client. This is a prohibited practice. According to the Insurance Council of British Columbia\u2019s Code of Conduct, agents \u201cmust deliver insurance policies or evidence of insurance within a reasonable period of time.\u201d Example Kenneth received a policy for delivery to a client the afternoon before he went on vacation. He decided to delay the delivery until after his return several weeks later. He arrived at his client\u2019s home to learn the client had died a week earlier. The estate\u2019s executors took legal action against Kenneth as his unnecessary delay had very serious consequences. 4.2.3.8 Misrepresentation \u00b6 Misrepresentation is when an agent creates, issues, circulates or even omits any statement, illustration or sales material that results in a false, misleading or deceptive insurance policy or contract (issued or to be issued). The Insurance Act of Ontario describes misrepresentations as an \u201cunfair or deceptive act or practice.\u201d Example John, a life insurance agent, sends a newsletter to his clients stating that ABC Life Co. insurance products have a 100% guarantee on all life payments: \u201cNo questions asked!\u201d The insurer was never made aware of this newsletter or its content. Years later, a claim made by the beneficiary of a life policy issued by ABC Life Co. is refused. The policy had been issued through the agency of John. The beneficiary sues John for the full amount of the death benefit on the grounds of misrepresentation, using the newsletter as evidence. 4.2.3.9 Misappropriating client funds (commingling of funds) \u00b6 Misappropriating client funds is when an agent receives money from a client for a specific purpose and fraudulently uses it for something else. This is a prohibited and illegal practice. According to the Alberta Insurance Council Code of Conduct, an agent receiving funds on behalf of an insurer must ensure to: Not encumber (obstruct) the funds without the prior consent of the insurer; Not use or apply the funds for purposes other than as described in the agreement with the insurer or the client; Pay to the insurer all funds collected or received. For premium payments submitted with an application, insurance companies typically require a cheque to be drawn on a client\u2019s account and do not allow cash transactions. Cash not only complicates record keeping but also makes the agent vulnerable to accusations of wrongdoing if the insured insists he paid the agent more than he truly did. Money should never be deposited by an agent into his or her personal account - even if the aim is to give a cheque from that account to an insurer. Typically, firm rules exist concerning third-party payments for premiums and are included in the insurance contract. Example Joe, a life insurance agent, asks two of his clients to make their cheques payable to him for transmission to the insurer concerned. The first cheque is for investing into a tax-free savings account (TFSA) and the second cheque is for repaying a loan against a whole life policy. A few days later, Joe informs his clients that the funds have been sent to the insurer when, in fact, he deposited the money into his own bank account. Joe was subsequently arrested by police and convicted of theft over $5,000 under the Criminal Code. Evidence of misappropriation of client funds is sufficient to support a finding that Joe should be prevented from being licensed as a life agent. 4.2.3.10 Making a false document (forgery) \u00b6 Forgery refers to when an agent knowingly makes a false document. This is a prohibited practice and is a criminal offence. Example Harry, a life insurance agent, is aware of the terminal illness of one of his wealthy clients, who has never named a beneficiary and who has no family or close relatives. In the month prior to the death of his client, Harry decides to file an application to name as the beneficiary of the policy a mutual friend of his and a client with whom Harry has conspired. Harry forges the signature of his client on the application to give it the appearance of validity. In doing so, Harry commits forgery. To determine client identity and ensure all transactions are lawful, an agent must collect all the correct information needed. False witnessing of signatures and false declarations breach the professional standards described in many of the codes of conducts. Example Having never met with his client, Alessio signed as a witness to client signatures on a life insurance application and declared that he completed the application in person with his client. Alessio has in effect submitted a false document. In certain extenuating circumstances, documents may be couriered to a client. However, this requires that only the intended recipient sign for the package after presenting photo ID. When documents are couriered to the client, a postage-paid return envelope should be included for the client to return the documents to the agent/insurer. A witness, who is not connected to the contract in any way or could potentially profit from the contract, is advised to oversee the signatures. 4.2.3.11 Holding out improperly \u00b6 Holding out improperly refers to when an agent does not comply with general business requirements. According to The Canadian Association of Independent Life Brokerage Agencies (CAILBA), a life insurance agent who acts in accordance with general business requirements and thus holds out properly must: Ensure his licence is clearly visible and posted in a public place; Hold out under the name on the licence unless provincial regulation permits differently; Conduct themselves honestly in terms of qualifications or the nature of business being conducted; Not use terms that suggest specialized training and capabilities unless the agent has in fact obtained the asserted training level and/or competency; Not claim to have \u201cassociates\u201d unless there is at least one licensed individual with equal or better qualifications; Not hold out as a financial planner unless holding a planning designation recognized by the Financial Planning Standards Council. Example Cynthia printed new business cards with a designation she had not earned. She misled her clients and potential clients into believing she had the qualifications reflected by the designation. Cynthia was \u201cholding out improperly,\u201d which is a deceptive practice. 4.2.3.12 Misusing company-provided illustrations \u00b6 Misusing company-provided illustrations refers to when an agent does not present product information in an accurate, complete and honest manner. Agents must present product information in clear and easy-to-understand language. If an insurer produces an insurance product illustration for a client, the agent must not change or alter the illustration in any way. According to the Code of Conduct for the Insurance Council of Manitoba, an agent \u201cmust not use sales materials or illustrations that are misleading or unnecessarily confusing.\u201d Example Gary received an illustration for a potential client. The results were not what Gary expected, so he modified the illustration, removing the surrender charges from the company illustration to make it look more appealing. This is a prohibited practice and misinforms the client. 4.2.3.13 Defamation \u00b6 Is when an agent is maliciously critical or derogatory about a colleague, agency or insurer. This is an unethical and discouraged practice. According to the Insurance Council of Alberta\u2019s Code of Conduct, it is an improper practice to discredit insurance companies. Example George is upset that another agent, James, acquire one of his potential clients. George sends an email to all his clients making malicious and derogatory comments about James, James\u2019s office manager, and the company James represents. This behaviour goes against the ethical standards of a life insurance agent. 4.2.4 Making proper disclosure \u00b6 Agents must disclose all relevant client information to the insurer. Disclosure helps reinforce fair treatment of clients because all information submitted on a life insurance application can impact premium pricing, exclusions and ratings, and, ultimately, whether or not the policy is issued or rejected. Example Nabila, an agent, does not disclose to the insurer that Leslie, the applicant, has a pre-existing health condition. Nabila reasons that if this information were disclosed, the insurer would apply a rating and Leslie would decline to proceed with the application and pay the additional premium, leaving her uninsured. Believing that it would be in Leslie\u2019s best interest to have the insurance, Nabila completes the application without noting Leslie\u2019s pre-existing health condition. Nabila explains to Leslie that omitting this \u201cdetail\u201d will keep the premium down and Leslie gratefully signs the application. Upon Leslie\u2019s death, her beneficiaries were expecting the funds needed to pay off the balance owed on Leslie\u2019s mortgage. Instead, as a result of the misrepresentation of Leslie\u2019s health on her application, the insurer returned the premiums paid, a much lower amount, leaving her beneficiaries with no choice but to sell the house to pay off the mortgage. Nabila should never have omitted this pre-existing health condition as it was dishonest and did not serve the clients\u2019 best interests or that of her beneficiaries. 4.2.4.1 Product disclosure \u00b6 Agents should provide: Complete and accurate information about any insurance product; How the product aligns is in line with the client\u2019s needs; and The full disclosure of the business relationship between the life agent and the insurer. Life insurance agents should keep proper documentation in their client files that demonstrates that the relevant and correct disclosure has been made. The following is the minimum information the agent should disclose to the client about the product in writing: The provinces and territories where the agent is licensed to sell insurance products; The insurer(s) that the agent represents; The nature of the relationship with the insurer(s) represented; How the agent is compensated (method of remuneration); If the agent is eligible for further compensation based on other factors such as volume of business placed in a specific period. For example, cash or non-monetary awards such as travel incentives; Any conflicts of interest; The fact that the client has the right to ask for more information. 4.2.4.2 Disclosure about replacement \u00b6 The Life Insurance Replacement Declaration (LIRD) is a harmonized disclosure form regarding policy replacements adopted by Canadian regulators and must be completed by an insurance agent when replacing a client\u2019s insurance policy. Before recommending the replacement of a life insurance policy, an agent should have a basic understanding of: How the policies differ; Why it might be appropriate to recommend a replacement; The risks inherent in replacement (even when it may be appropriate); Existing insurance that may have cash values; Any negative tax consequences. The agent must meet all of the correct disclosure requirements in place to protect the client\u2019s interests when a life insurance policy is being replaced. The LIRD describes many of the key elements the client must know of before replacing a life insurance policy or rider. This helps the client make informed decisions based on the relevant details disclosed to them before making their decision. Along with the LIRD, the agent must complete a written comparative explanation of the benefits and disadvantages of replacing the life insurance and provide copies of those documents to the client. Using questions in the declaration is a good way for the agent to guide the client through the written explanation. The agent should review the written explanation with the client once the declaration has been completed by the client. Example Roberto, a life insurance agent, is contacted by Anne, a policyholder, who is interested in increasing her life insurance coverage. She has a $100,000 permanent life insurance policy and wants to use the $40,000 cash value to buy a $250,000 permanent life insurance policy. Anne is leaving for vacation in two days and wants Roberto to expedite this replacement as quickly as possible. Roberto knows that replacing an existing life insurance policy with a new one is often not in the policyholder\u2019s best interest. However, Anne is in a hurry, and Roberto feels that there is not enough time to explain to her all the pros and cons of a replacement. He does not want to risk losing the sale by making Anne impatient. Roberto acted appropriately when he decided to tell Anne that regulations require that he discuss the situation with her further and provide her and the insurance company with a summary of this discussion. 4.2.4.3 Commission sharing \u00b6 Commission sharing refers to a fee payment, or an exchange of something of value, dependent on a portion of the commission earned on a sale of a life insurance product. Agents may split commissions with another life insurance agent, provided both agents are appropriately licensed. An agent must inform the client if there will be commission splitting with another agent, and must provide all details of the split. Example Phytos is a real estate agent. His client Martha has just purchased a beautiful mansion and Phytos recommends that she visit his licensed life insurance agent, Fred, who can help her obtain life insurance to cover her mortgage in the unfortunate event she should pass away. Unbeknownst to Martha, Phytos always recommends Fred because they have a private agreement whereby Phytos receives 50% of the commission owed to Fred from the sale of the life insurance product. Martha purchases the life insurance without full disclosure of the facts. 4.2.4.4 Referrals and referral fees \u00b6 A referral is a fee paid for a \u201clead\u201d or prospective client, regardless of whether or not it results in a product sale. A referral fee must not be contingent upon a sale. A referral fee must not be a percentage of the commission earned. An exception is when the payment is being made to another licensed agent (i.e., commission splitting). Agents should disclose the details of any referral arrangements to clients. According to the Licensee Responsibilities issued by the Insurance Council of British Columbia, the following conditions must be met before paying a referral fee: It must be clear to the licensee that the individual to whom they are paying the referral fee did not undergo any insurance activities, in other words, did not act as an insurance agent, with the client; Following this, the client is given a written disclosure affirming that the individual is being compensated for the referral. If the described conditions are not met, any referral fee payments made will be considered a deceptive practice and will potentially bring upon penalties. This may vary from one jurisdiction to another. The agent should take the time to verify with the relevant regulator before entering into a referral fee agreement. Example Jonathan has an arrangement with several real estate agents who will refer homebuyers to him for life insurance. He pays a flat fee per name referred and the payment is disclosed to the potential client. If Jonathan had not disclosed this to his clients, he would be acting in an unethical way. Referral fees are not prohibited in Ontario: As long as the person who provides the referral is not engaging in acts that would require an insurance agent\u2019s or insurance broker\u2019s licence, that person and the agent may enter into a financial arrangement for referrals (but not sharing of commission). 4.2.5 Acting in compliance with regulations and codes of conducts \u00b6 Agents must abide by the guidelines and regulations in the regulatory documents they read and sign. The following are three of the agent\u2019s key responsibilities discussed in sequence below: Maintaining the required liability insurance, errors and omissions (E&O) coverage (or professional liability insurance); Documenting the file; Delivering the contract. 4.2.5.1 Maintaining the required liability insurance, errors and omissions (E&O) coverage \u00b6 Errors and omissions (E&O) coverage is a coverage that: Provides indemnity for negligence, error, or omissions (professional liability insurance); and Protects life insurance agents from potential financial losses they may incur as a result. According to the Insurance Act, agents are obligated to have and maintain E&O coverage in order to engage in selling activities under their licence. E&O coverage is not obligated for selling activities under the licences or registrations of others. E&O protects agents against genuine errors but not against intentional or fraudulent acts. Example 1 Lowenna sues her life insurance agent, Anthony, to recover a financial loss stemming from him having provided incorrect advice. This is an error on Anthony\u2019s part, and he can claim on his E&O coverage. The agent should maintain uninterrupted E&O coverage as required by the province or territory requirements in which he or she sells life insurance or provides service to clients. If the agent plans on leaving the business, returning or selling the practice, he or she should organize and pay for extended E&O coverage. Example 2 Elizabeth, a life insurance agent, intends to retire at the end of the year. She intends to maintain her E&O insurance coverage as long as possible. She also intends to negotiate with the person who buys her book of business to accept liability for any claims after she sells it. 4.2.5.2 Documenting the file \u00b6 It is very important for the agent to properly and clearly document all client files with detailed notes and correspondence of the original transactions, the recommendations made and the client\u2019s acceptance or non-acceptance of those recommendations to avoid any possible complaints or lawsuits against an agent. This ensures that the agent has proof to demonstrate that he or she conducted business in a correct and fair manner. If the agent did make an error, the applicable files will show this and the agent will need to take the relevant steps with his E&O insurer. Example Tuan-Anh, a life insurance agent, is contacted by a lawyer representing a client, Jackie, who claims misrepresentation. They are threatening to file a lawsuit against him seeking damages and to go after the removal of his insurance licence. Tuan-Anh will need to have all the files and documents available to help defend his position. Tuan-Anh must also notify his E&O insurer immediately of the situation. 4.2.5.3 Contract delivery \u00b6 Agents must accurately deliver policies in good faith. Before delivering a policy, agents need to verify if the client has any change in health. The agent must check that the insured is in good health: When the client signs the contract; During the time between the signing of the contract and the contract delivery; and When the contract is delivered (typically within 30 days). The agent must not give provide the client with the policy, and he must update the application if the client\u2019s health status changed since the application was signed. Example Jeff, a life insurance agent, meets with his client Annabelle to have the finalized contract signed. As soon as Annabelle walks into his office, he asks if there has been any change in her health since he asked her the initial questions on her health status. Annabelle says no and that the nurse had visited to carry out the routine check. Jeff is satisfied that all is in order and delivers the contract. If Annabelle had said that she had been hiding a pre-existing health condition or recently been diagnosed with an illness then Jeff would have had to submit another application with the up-to-date information. 4.2.6 Handling complaints in a timely and fair manner \u00b6 It is important that agents handle client complaints in a timely manner, fairly and in good faith. 4.2.6.1 Definition of complaint \u00b6 A complaint is an expression of dissatisfaction with an agent\u2019s service, and may involve a claim for a financial loss. 4.2.6.2 Ethical complaints \u00b6 An ethical complaint refers to an allegation that the agent violated a codified ethical standard (i.e., a code of conduct and ethics) and should be taken very seriously. 4.2.6.3 Procedures to follow \u00b6 Agents should maintain a complaint log (also referred to as a complaint register) to keep track of any complaints received. The log should include the following items: Life insurance agent; Whether the complaint was verbal or in writing; Recipient of complaint; Individual handling the complaint; Summary of the complaint; Whether or not a regulatory authority is involved; Whether the complaint was reported to the insurer and/or Managing General Agent (MGA); Contract information; Steps towards resolution; Statement of resolution; Date of resolution. This complaint log ensures that the agent is prepared for any regulatory audits or other audits. 4.2.7 Core ethical values \u00b6 Agents must ensure their business practices follow ethical standards, such as: Acting in good faith (care, competence and integrity); Managing conflicts of interest properly; Refraining from unfair or deceptive acts or practices; Making proper disclosure; Acting in compliance of regulation and codes of conducts; Handling complaints in a timely and fair manner. The livelihood and success of all agents depend on public confidence. Therefore, all industry players, including insurance agents, benefit from public confidence. Developing an ethical culture providing a framework that motivates and guides appropriate agent decisions is a strong way to help public confidence grow. 4.3 Licensing Process and Regulations \u00b6 This section outlines the licensing process and regulations for carrying a licence. 4.3.1 Purpose of licensing life insurance agents and agencies \u00b6 Licensing is a key part of the legal and regulatory framework by which an agent must abide. The notion of public order in licensing aims to protect the public against incompetent agents, unfair or deceptive practices and unethical activities. Licensing is a principle means of regulating and supervising life insurance agents in order to adequately protect clients. Life insurance agents must be licensed in each province or territory where they conduct business. The agent must ensure that he or she restricts his or her practice to places where he or she is licensed. Licensing is also referred to as \u201cauthorization,\u201d \u201ccertification\u201d or \u201cregistration,\u201d depending on the agent\u2019s province or territory. 4.3.2 Licensing regime \u00b6 When applying for a life insurance licence, applicants must complete the Life Licence Qualification Program (LLQP). There are two types: Full LLQP which combines both life insurance and accident and sickness insurance training; LLQP Accident and Sickness which covers only accident and sickness insurance. An accident and sickness agent would need to obtain a full licence (full LLQP) to sell life insurance and is otherwise prohibited from selling life insurance products. Steps involved for obtaining a life insurance licence and becoming a life insurance agent: The applicant must pass the LLQP; The applicant must submit a fully completed application to the licensing authority; The application must then be approved; All forms must be honestly and accurately filled out by the new applicants; The applicant must then be hired by an employer and obtain an agency contract. Any false or misleading statements provided by the applicant may result in licence revocation and administrative penalties. Agent certification refers to the individual. Agency certification refers to a corporation. Insurance activities may not be conducted by unlicensed applicants. The licence must be valid at the time business is being conducted. Fully licensed agents can sell products including the following: Individual and group life insurance policies; Individual and group accident and sickness (including disability) insurance policies; Individual and group annuities (including guaranteed investment accounts (GIA), segregated funds and immediate annuities). 4.3.3 Selling to and servicing out-of-province clients \u00b6 To sell insurance to a client, the agent must be licensed in the client\u2019s province or territory of residence. Reciprocal licensing is in place for agents who want to sell to clients outside of the province in which they are licensed. Reciprocal licensing refers to the reliance model put forth by the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators whereby regulatory authorities in other provinces \u201crely on the requirements of a life agent\u2019s home jurisdiction, with the option to request that an agent meet further requirements specific to the new or host jurisdiction.\u201d This model harmonizes application forms, continuing education standards, and errors and omission (E&O) insurance requirements for agents. However, provinces and territories are not currently required to introduce any additional licensing requirements. This model makes it easy for agents to be licensed with common standards in multiple provinces across Canada. 4.3.4 Revoking of licence \u00b6 Regulators have the power to suspend or revoke an agent\u2019s licence for any activities they deem inappropriate, unethical or illegal. Records of any such instances are maintained by regulatory authorities and are available to clients. Once an agent\u2019s licence has been suspended, it can be very difficult for an agent to gain the trust of potential clients. Once an agent\u2019s licence has been revoked, it is very difficult to obtain another licence. According to the Insurance Act, Ontario Regulation: \u201cThe Superintendent may suspend or revoke a licence on any grounds on which an application for a licence may be refused or if, after due investigation and hearing, it appears to the Superintendent that the licensee: has violated any provision of the licence in the licensee\u2019s operations as an agent; has made a material misstatement or omission in the application for the licence; has been guilty of a fraudulent act or practice; or has demonstrated incompetence or untrustworthiness to transact the insurance agency business for which the licence has been granted.\u201d 4.3.5 Other products and services for which a licence or registration is required (not exhaustive) \u00b6 Agents must be licensed to sell the following products and services: Property and casualty insurance; Securities, including exchange-traded funds (ETF) or mutual funds; Mortgage brokering. 4.3.5.1 Property and casualty insurance \u00b6 The law obligates life insurance agents to hold a separate insurance licence to sell property and casualty insurance. 4.3.5.2 Securities, including exchange-traded funds (ETF) or mutual funds \u00b6 A life insurance agent is required to have a licence from the applicable securities regulator or self-regulatory organization to sell securities such as stocks, bonds, options, commodities, ETFs or mutual funds. Generally, each security type requires its own licence or distinct registration. 4.3.5.3 Mortgage brokering \u00b6 Mortgage brokering requires a separate mortgage brokerage licence issued by a mortgage broker regulator. Mortgage broker licences vary from province to province. If the information provided is accurate and appropriate, a life agent generally does not need a mortgage brokerage licence to give mortgage referrals that provide limited information about a borrower to a potential lender (and vice versa). Life agents who give mortgage referrals should work within the guidelines of the legislation regulating mortgage brokers. 4.3.6 Other products and services for which no licence is required \u00b6 On the other hand, the following activities do not require any specific licences or registration: Acting as a deposit broker; Acting as a financial planner. 4.3.6.1 Acting as a deposit broker \u00b6 In Canada, licences are not required for deposit brokers who work for banks or other deposit-taking institutions. At present, there are no regulatory authorities overseeing these brokers\u2019 activities. 4.3.6.2 Acting as a financial planner \u00b6 Licensed life insurance agents do not require an additional licence to give clients advice regarding their financial circumstances. However, it would be false for a life agent to call himself a financial planner. Therefore, licensed life insurance agents must use caution when referring to themselves as financial planners, since each jurisdiction might have different rules regarding the use of the title financial planner.","title":"Chapter 4 Rules and Principles"},{"location":"ethics/Chapter_4_Rules_and_Principles_Governing/#chapter-4-rules-and-principles-governing-the-activities-of-life-insurance-agents-and-accident-sickness-insurance-agents","text":"","title":"Chapter 4: Rules and Principles Governing the Activities of Life Insurance Agents and Accident &amp; Sickness Insurance Agents"},{"location":"ethics/Chapter_4_Rules_and_Principles_Governing/#40-rules-and-principles-governing-the-activities-of-life-insurance-agents-and-accident-sickness-insurance-agents","text":"Ethical conduct and closely following professional practice standards are both critical to the role of licensed insurance agents.

Life insurance agents have a responsibility to report suspicious transactions and terrorist property. The agent\u2019s role under Canada\u2019s Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act is to focus on the four following areas: Ascertaining each client\u2019s identity and confirming the existence of entities; Third-party determination; Determination of the purpose; Determination of politically exposed persons and heads of international organizations; Obligation to report suspicious transactions, terrorist property and large cash transactions. Ascertaining each client\u2019s identity Under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Regulations and FINTRAC\u2019s Guidances, the life insurance agent is required to establish a client\u2019s identity who: Is purchasing an immediate or deferred annuity; or Is purchasing a life insurance policy that is not an exempt policy, towards which the client can pay a minimum of $10,000 during the annuity or policy, regardless of the payment method. Exempted products consist of: Individual or group registered retirement income plans (RRSP, RRIF, LIRA, LIF, DPSP, RPP, and TFSA); Exempt life insurance policies; and Health or accident insurance policies with no cash surrender value (CSV). It is important for the agent to record the information covered by these laws in the client information record. While the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act does not require agents to ascertain the client\u2019s identity for certain products, the insurer has obligations under the Act that may require the agent to ascertain the client\u2019s identity. Also, confirming the identity of a client can ensure that the client\u2019s age has been accurately reported or that the insurer has acted in accordance with its obligations under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). FATCA is an American law intended to prevent tax evasion by U.S. residents and citizens who hold accounts outside of the U.S. Non-registered plans The agent is obligated to ascertain each holder, owner and joint holder\u2019s identity in person. The client must bring an identification document with a unique identifier number from a provincial, territorial or federal government. Originals of the following are acceptable identification documents which the client may use to prove their identity: Government-issued photo identification method where the document must be authentic, valid and current; Credit file method where the information must be valid and current; or; Dual-process method where the information must be valid and current and from different sources. FINTRAC\u2019s Guidance also indicates how to identify the identity of an individual when the agent is not physically in presence of the individual he has to identify. An insurance agent can use an individual\u2019s provincial health card, but only if it is not prohibited by provincial or territorial legislation. The insurance agent may use a social insurance card to verify the identity of a client, but a social insurance number may not be used in a declaration made to FINTRAC. Most insurers refuse that insurance agents use a social insurance card to verify the identity of a client. Confirming the existence of the entity and identifying the beneficial owners Individual or group insurance for an entity The agent is obligated to ascertain the client\u2019s identity if the client is a corporation or another type of entity. The client must then provide sufficient proof of identity, such as a corporate status certificate and the names of the directors. The client must provide the insurer with the name, date of birth and information on the authorized signatories of the corporation or entity (i.e., company, not-for-profit organization, estates, trusts, etc.). Individual or group insurance for an entity other than an estate or trust The client must provide the insurer with all of the individuals\u2019 names owning a share of the entity along with the home address and professional details on individuals who control 25% or more of the entity. The agent must collect additional information if the client is a legal person (company) or another form of entity, such as the ultimate beneficiaries of the entity (the identity of the individuals who ultimately control the legal person or other form of entity). This cannot be another legal person or entity. Typically, insurance forms state what information to request. When the client is a legal person (company) or another form of entity, the insurance agent must also confirm and retain the information on the ultimate beneficiaries of the entity, or, in other words, the identity of the individuals who ultimately control the legal person or other form of entity (beneficial ownership), which cannot be another legal person or entity. These obligations include: obtaining information that describes the ownership, control and structure of the entity, including corporations and trusts; and if the entity is a corporation, obtaining the names of all the directors, as well as the names and addresses of the beneficial owners; if the entity is a trust, obtaining the names and addresses of all trustees and known beneficiaries and settlors of the trust; if the entity is other than a corporation or trust, obtaining the names and addresses of the beneficial owners; and taking reasonable measures to confirm the accuracy of the information obtained, and keeping records of the information obtained and the measures taken to confirm its accuracy. If an entity is a not-for-profit organization, the life insurance agent must also determine if the entity is a registered charity under the Income Tax Act or if it is an unregistered not-for-profit organization that solicits charitable donations from the public. Third-party determination The agent must verify, with certainty, the identity of the individual who is submitting the insurance application. A third-party determination form must be completed if the person applying for insurance is acting on behalf of a third party (for example, a power of attorney). The third-party denomination form must specify the following: If the third party is an individual - the individual\u2019s name, address, date of birth and nature of his principal business or occupation (if the third party is an individual); If the third party is an entity - its name, address and nature of its principal business; If the third party is a corporation - its incorporation number and place of incorporation; and The nature of the relationship between the insured and the person completing the application (the third party). In some cases, the insurance agent has reasonable grounds to suspect that the individual is acting on behalf of a third party but cannot determine it in the typical way described above. In this case, the individual or entity must keep a document that: According to the client, states if the transaction is being conducted on behalf of a third party; and Outlines the reasonable grounds to suspect that the client is indeed acting on behalf of a third party. Determination of politically exposed persons (PEP) and heads of international organizations (HIO) A life insurance agent must take reasonable measures to determine if a person is a foreign PEP, a domestic PEP, a HIO, or the family member or close associate of one of these, if the person makes a lump-sum payment of $100,000 or more towards an immediate or deferred annuity or life insurance policy, on their own behalf or at the instruction of someone else. A life insurance agent must also take reasonable measures to establish the source of funds for the lump-sum transaction for these persons. Reasonable measures include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following actions: asking the client; conducting an open source search; or consulting a source of commercially available information. Determination of the purpose Since February 1, 2014, the client must indicate the purpose of the product they are purchasing. Obligation to report suspicious transactions Suspicious transactions (attempted or completed) must be reported by the agent to FINTRAC as soon as practicable after the agent\u2019s first suspicion. If an agent suspects that a transaction (or group of transactions) constitutes money laundering or used to finance terrorist activities, the agent must report the transaction (or group of transactions). Note that the intention to conduct a suspicious transaction should also be reported. These are some suspicious transaction indicators that an agent is most likely to notice: The client refuses to provide the required identification documents and seeks to establish his identity through means other than identification documents or unreasonably delays submitting company documents; The client acts withdrawn or anxious, explains himself in a strange way or is monitored or accompanied by another individual; The client shows unusual curiosity about internal controls or unusual knowledge of legislation on suspicious transaction reporting; The client deposits third-party cheques for very large amounts; The client is more interested in the ramifications of a product\u2019s termination than its long-term benefits; The transaction is disproportionally complicated for its purpose; The transaction is not in line with the client\u2019s apparent financial situation or strange activities; and The client provides a P.O. Box in an area where P.O. Boxes are not generally used (i.e., cities). Note that failure to comply with this protocol can lead to serious criminal charges against the agent. On the other hand, if suspicious transactions are reported in a timely fashion and in good faith, the agent is protected against legal action. Obligation to report terrorist property When the life Insurance agent knows that property in Is possession or under his control is owned, controlled by or on behalf of a terrorist or a terrorist group, the life Insurance agent must submit a report without delay. The life Insurance agent must also submit a report to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). Obligation to report large cash transaction Requirements also apply to large cash transactions, such as a single deposit of $10,000 or more, or two or more $10,000 deposits within a 24-hour period. Insurers, however, rarely accept cash payments. When a client purchasing a policy makes a deposit of $100,000 or more, in any payment form, the agent must check whether the client is a politically exposed foreign person. The agent has 15 days after the transaction to report this type of client. Generally, a politically exposed foreign person is someone who has held a government or legal position in a foreign country, or is the spouse or a close family member of this individual. Insurance forms contain information on this subject.","title":"4.1.4.2 Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC)"},{"location":"ethics/Chapter_4_Rules_and_Principles_Governing/#4143-assuris","text":"Assuris is a not-for-profit organization whose mandate is to protect Canadian policyholders in the event that their life insurance company should fail.

In order to take advantage of her new clients for her own benefit, she advised one of them that he should buy a term annuity with his existing registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) to provide income, and reinvest the portion he did not need in an individual variable insurance contract (IVIC). Christine earned a commission on both the purchase of the annuity and the investment in the IVIC. A relative of the client discovered what had happened and complained to the insurer, who terminated Christine\u2019s contract. The client subsequently sued Christine and the insurer. Twisting is when an agent recommends a client cancel one product to purchase another (usually from a different insurer) in order to generate commission from the new sale even though the sale typically does not benefit the client. The agent often withholds key information on the total consequences (i.e., financial loss) of cancelling their policy. This is a prohibited practice. According to the Independent Financial Brokers of Canada\u2019s (IFBC) code of ethics, agents must not recommend the replacement of any product unless it is in the best interest of the client.

According to the Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO) fronting refers to when: A licensed agent chooses to have a different agent who has nothing to do with the transaction sign as the agent of record or; An unlicensed individual organizes the business and has a licensed person sign on their behalf. For example, to save time and effort, an agent splits her commission with an unlicensed person who carries out and completes business transactions in the agent\u2019s name even though the agent has never met these clients. It is unwise and inappropriate for an agent to \u201cfront\u201d business generated by someone else. Agents should not allow themselves to be used by someone else.

For premium payments submitted with an application, insurance companies typically require a cheque to be drawn on a client\u2019s account and do not allow cash transactions. Cash not only complicates record keeping but also makes the agent vulnerable to accusations of wrongdoing if the insured insists he paid the agent more than he truly did. Money should never be deposited by an agent into his or her personal account - even if the aim is to give a cheque from that account to an insurer. Typically, firm rules exist concerning third-party payments for premiums and are included in the insurance contract. Example Joe, a life insurance agent, asks two of his clients to make their cheques payable to him for transmission to the insurer concerned. The first cheque is for investing into a tax-free savings account (TFSA) and the second cheque is for repaying a loan against a whole life policy. A few days later, Joe informs his clients that the funds have been sent to the insurer when, in fact, he deposited the money into his own bank account.

Harry forges the signature of his client on the application to give it the appearance of validity. In doing so, Harry commits forgery. To determine client identity and ensure all transactions are lawful, an agent must collect all the correct information needed.

The agent must meet all of the correct disclosure requirements in place to protect the client\u2019s interests when a life insurance policy is being replaced. The LIRD describes many of the key elements the client must know of before replacing a life insurance policy or rider. This helps the client make informed decisions based on the relevant details disclosed to them before making their decision. Along with the LIRD, the agent must complete a written comparative explanation of the benefits and disadvantages of replacing the life insurance and provide copies of those documents to the client. Using questions in the declaration is a good way for the agent to guide the client through the written explanation.

Derek and Becky\u2019s Family Case Study Derek and Becky are 47 and 38 years old respectively and they have been married for two years. Derek and his previous wife, Susan (aged 44), divorced four years ago, and they share joint custody of a son, Jordan (age 8). Prior to marrying Derek, Becky was a single mother to Anya (aged 4). Derek formally adopted Anya when they got married. Derek and Becky have just had a child together; Robbie is two months old. Derek and Becky are concerned about securing their financial future in the event that Derek dies, and they have approached a licensed life insurance agent to help them assess their insurance needs. 10.1 Assess the family dynamics \u00b6 Many people use life insurance to provide financial support for their families upon their death. Agents need to understand their clients\u2019 family dynamics before being able to advise how to best provide that support. 10.1.1 Current spouse \u00b6 Many people use life insurance to provide financial support for their families in the event of their unexpected death. There is an expectation that when people are married, either as legal or common-law spouses, the income earners in the family will arrange their affairs so that their spouse, and children, will be supported financially if they die. The amount of support would depend on the nature of the relationship and the surviving beneficiary\u2019s own financial capacity. For example, if there is a primary income earner (i.e., a single-income household), that individual would become the proposed life insured in a life insurance policy, and the spouse would be the beneficiary. In dual-income households, the surviving spouse may earn enough to be fully self-sufficient if one spouse dies. 10.1.1.1 Dependent vs. self-sufficient \u00b6 A sole income earner for the family will usually need to replace his or her entire income for the surviving spouse\u2019s use or to help cover childcare expenses if the spouse were to return to work. If the life insured and spouse both earn an income, each spouse\u2019s earning power will be taken into consideration when determining the total amount of financial support that would be needed. Case Study Derek is employed full-time as the Vice President of Industrial Design for a manufacturing company, with take-home pay (i.e., income after taxes and deductions) of $8,400 per month. Becky currently stays home caring for Jordan, Anya and Robbie, but she intends to return to work as a human resources manager once Robbie is in school full-time, about six years from now. She anticipates that her take-home pay will be around $4,500 per month. However, Derek feels that, if he dies, he would prefer that Becky would not have to return to work until Robbie is 18, if at all possible. If Derek were to die today, the family would obviously suffer from the loss of his income and, even if Becky could return to work immediately upon his death, her income would be insufficient to maintain the family\u2019s current standard of living. 10.1.2 Support obligation to ex-spouse(s) \u00b6 An ex-spouse may require financial support. The obligation for financial support may end if the ex-spouse remarries. 10.1.2.1 Court-ordered insurance \u00b6 When a court demands financial support for an ex-spouse, the court order often will specify that sufficient life insurance, naming the ex-spouse as beneficiary, be obtained by the supporting spouse to satisfy the support obligation. Without life insurance, the ex-spouse could make a claim against the estate of the deceased spouse to seek financial restitution. The life insurance death benefit must be calculated based on the monthly support obligation multiplied by the period of time for which support has been ordered. For example, the monthly support obligation is $1,000 and it is ordered to last for 16 years. The policy death benefit must be a minimum of $192,000 ( $1,000 \u00d7 (16 \u00d7 12)). Case Study Derek and Susan used a mediator to develop their spousal support agreement, which specifies that Derek must pay spousal support of $500 per month until Susan reaches age 65 or she remarries, whichever occurs first. While their support agreement was not court-ordered, Derek told his life agent that he wants to ensure that the $500 in spousal support is paid monthly to Susan even if he dies. 10.1.3 Minor children \u00b6 Minor children should be provided for, at least until age 18 or if the child is enrolled full-time in a post-secondary institution and is still a dependant, then the support obligation would be required to continue until the approximate age of 22 or 23 (the completion of the first post-secondary degree). The financial need may encompass both living expenses for the children and the costs of post-secondary education. Case Study Derek wants to ensure that Becky has the financial resources she will need to raise their children if he dies prematurely. In addition to their living expenses, he would also like to ensure that all three children will have enough money to pay for post-secondary education. 10.1.3.1 Current care arrangements \u00b6 A stay-at-home spouse and a caregiver to children have economic value - consider the cost of paying for full-time childcare. The death of a stay-at-home parent can also have a huge financial impact on the family. Case Study Becky is not currently earning an income, but her role as the stay-at-home parent is vital to the family. If she died, Derek would have to pay for someone else to take care of Jordan, Anya and Robbie so that he could continue to work. In addition, the family would not benefit from the income Becky hopes to earn when she returns to work in six years. 10.1.3.2 Child support to ex-spouse \u00b6 There is a legal requirement to provide financial support for children from prior relationships who may be in the full custody or partial custody of the ex-spouse/ex-partner. 10.1.3.3 Court-ordered insurance \u00b6 A court may order a parent to pay child support and as part of the court-ordered divorce or separation agreement, require the supporting parent to obtain life insurance so that in the event of death of the supporting parent the support obligations will continue to be satisfied until the child reaches adulthood (is no longer legally considered a dependant). If the court order for child support is silent on the issue of how support is to be paid in the event of the death of the parent who is paying support, the surviving parent may have a claim for support against the estate of the deceased on behalf of the child or children. Case Study As part of their mediated divorce agreement, Derek agreed to pay child support to Susan for Jordan, in the amount of $1,000 per month, until Jordan is 19 years old. While it was not specifically addressed in their agreement, Derek wants to ensure that Jordan continues to benefit from this support even if he dies. 10.1.4 Other dependants \u00b6 Depending on the life insured\u2019s situation, there may be other family members who would suffer financially if the life insured were to die. 10.1.4.1 Disabled family members \u00b6 A family member who is disabled may require significant financial support and care during his or her life. With such financial burdens, the policyholder must plan for the estate to provide the necessary support. Case Study Derek and Becky are fortunate that all of their children appear to be healthy and they expect the children to eventually become financially self-sufficient. Derek\u2019s older brother, Peter, and his wife Janine are not as fortunate; their eight-year-old son, Chase, has a severe developmental disability and he will never be able to live independently. However, Chase has a normal life expectancy, so Peter and Janine need to consider how to provide for him over a time frame that could extend 50 years or even more. 10.1.4.2 Aging parents \u00b6 Financial support for parents may be another need to be factored into the life insurance coverage calculation. Depending on the parent\u2019s financial situation, this care may be financial, physical or both. 10.2 Assess the employment situation \u00b6 The agent must determine whether income is earned as an employee, a business owner, or from retirement savings as loss of income is one of the biggest financial risks associated with death. 10.2.1 Employee \u00b6 The following factors should be taken into consideration for an employee and their insurance needs: 10.2.1.1 Current income \u00b6 Income that is earned on a regular basis (take-home pay - that is, the amount received after deductions) needs to be taken into consideration as part of the insurance needs analysis. If income is lost due to the death of a primary income earner, insurance can restore the lost spending power for survivors. The amount needed for this purpose is calculated as: net income multiplied by the number of years until planned retirement age. Income earned by an employed spouse may reduce the total sum needed. 10.2.1.2 Future income potential \u00b6 What is likely to happen with the job in the future? Is income likely to increase, due to increased wages, better job prospects, and to keep pace with inflation? If the desire is for the family to be able to maintain the same standard of living after the death of the life insured, then the insurance needs analysis needs to factor in expected future income and inflation. One possible solution to this need would be a universal life policy which, through the investment account, can provide an opportunity for investment growth and thus an increasing death benefit. Case Study Derek is a Vice President with take-home pay (i.e., pay after all tax and other deductions) of $8,400 per month. He expects to be promoted to Chief Operating Officer (COO) within the next two years, which would increase his take-home pay to $9,500 per month, with the potential for larger bonuses as well. This might suggest that he would want the flexibility to increase his insurance coverage in the future. 10.2.1.3 Job stability \u00b6 Does the life insured have a record of job and income stability? Job stability of both spouses is important to ensure future premiums can be paid. If income could be variable, then a policy should be offered that allows the life insured to temporarily reduce premiums without reducing coverage. Case Study While Becky plans to return to work once Robbie is in school full-time, she is worried that her time away from the workforce and her outdated technology skills may make finding a new job difficult. She may even have to spend time updating her training before she is employable. This makes the replacement of Derek\u2019s employment income even more important if he dies. 10.2.1.4 Group benefits \u00b6 The family of an income earner with group benefits may lose those benefits when the income earner dies. Replacing the benefits provided by group benefit coverage will comprise one need that should be included in the life insurance need analysis. When it comes to calculating how much coverage is appropriate in a personal policy, a life insured who is a member of a group life plan should reduce the amount of personal coverage needed by the amount of the group benefit. For example, Guy receives life coverage at work to a maximum value of his salary of $220,000. Therefore, his need for personal coverage could be calculated and reduced by $220,000. Likewise, if his group policy provides survivor income benefits (See Section 6.4) this would also reduce coverage required from a personal policy. See also Government benefits (Section 10.4.4). Case Study With three young children, Derek and Becky expect to have many dental and medical bills over the next 15 or 20 years. Becky already suffers from some arthritis; as a result, she wears custom orthotics and sees a physiotherapist regularly. All of these expenses are currently covered by Derek\u2019s plan, but that coverage would cease upon his death, increasing the strain on the surviving family\u2019s cash flow. 10.2.2 Business owner \u00b6 For life insureds who run a business (i.e., self-employed), how the business is structured needs to be considered when going through the insurance needs analysis, as it may impact the amount and type of life insurance required. 10.2.2.1 Sole proprietorship \u00b6 A business operated as a sole proprietorship often ceases to exist with the death of the sole proprietor and may be subsequently sold. Upon the death of a sole proprietor, net income is reported on the final tax return, with the potential for tax owing on income earned from the sale of any business assets. Case Study While neither Derek nor Becky is self-employed, Derek has three siblings (Peter, Mark, and Kimberly) who all own their own businesses. The examples in this section will focus on their businesses. Derek\u2019s brother Peter offers strategic management consulting services as a sole proprietor. His business income fluctuates from year to year, but on average he receives consulting income of $120,000 and he has related business expenses of $15,000 per year. He reports the net business income of $105,000 on his personal tax return. If Peter dies, his family will no longer benefit from this self-employment income. His business-related assets are minimal and include some home office furniture and computer technology, all of which have depreciated in value since purchase. If Peter dies, he will be deemed to have disposed of all of his business assets for their fair market value prior to death. Because they have decreased in value, this will not result in a capital gain. 10.2.2.2 Corporation \u00b6 A life insured who owns a private corporation may earn income in the form of a salary and/or taxable dividends. When the life insured dies, his shares are deemed to have been disposed of at their fair market value. This could lead to a capital gain, which if the business is a qualified small business corporation, can be reduced by the lifetime capital gains exemption (LCGE) of $883,384. A corporation can survive the life insured and continue beyond death and if the life insured\u2019s shares have been bequeathed to a beneficiary, he or she will continue to receive the dividends. Case Study Derek\u2019s sister, Kimberly, is one of two equal shareholders in Intersavvy Inc., a successful internet research company structured as a Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC). She receives an annual salary of $180,000 per year, as well as dividend income averaging $50,000 per year. The company has 12 other employees, and Kimberly is confident that the business will survive even if she dies. However, she is worried about the tax implications of the deemed disposition of her corporate shares upon her death. Even after using the LCGE of $883,384, she expects that the unsheltered taxable capital gain upon death will be in the order of $500,000. She is also worried about how her family will manage if she dies and they can no longer benefit from her annual salary of $180,000. 10.2.2.3 Partnership \u00b6 A life insured\u2019s interest in a partnership is deemed to have been disposed of at its fair market value when the life insured dies. Again, a capital gain can result. However, it cannot be reduced by the lifetime capital gains exemption (LCGE), as the LCGE applies only to capital gains earned from the sale of qualified small business shares, or from fishing or farming property. Case Study Derek\u2019s brother, Mark, owns and manages several apartment building complexes in partnership with his two adult children, Aaron and Penny. Mark owns 50% of the partnership while Aaron and Penny each own 25%. Mark\u2019s share of profits last year was $140,000. His will leave his partnership interest to Aaron and Penny. Because this business is structured as a partnership, it does not qualify for the LCGE and Mark is worried that the anticipated taxable capital gain of $400,000 upon his death will erode the rest of his estate, which he plans to leave to his wife, Michelle. 10.2.2.4 Existing buy-sell agreement \u00b6 A buy-sell agreement specifies that either the corporation or the other shareholders or partners to buy a deceased owner\u2019s interest in a company. The agreement would specify that the purchase would be done at a fixed price or a price based upon a predetermined formula. The owner may not leave the interest to an heir in their will when a buy-sell agreement exists. A share redemption plan is used if the corporation will buy the shares. A cross-purchase agreement is used if another shareholder or partner will buy the shares. The use of life insurance guarantees that funds will be available to buy the shares. Case Study Derek\u2019s sister, Kimberly, and Janet (who is the co-owner of Intersavvy Inc.) are in the process of implementing a buy-sell agreement. This agreement specifies that if Janet dies, Kimberly will buy Janet\u2019s shares from her estate for $2 million, and vice-versa. In accordance with their agreement, Kimberly must acquire a $2 million life insurance policy on Janet\u2019s life, to ensure she has the funds to comply with the agreement if Janet dies. 10.2.2.5 Business income stability and amounts \u00b6 Similar to assessing the stability of employment income, in assessing life insurance needs, the stability of income from self-employment should also be assessed. Is income from the business reliable and regular? Is the business at risk of failing? This stability shows the ability to pay premiums or, alternatively, the need for insurance with flexible premiums. If insurance is intended to support a family, its amount should reflect how business income might increase in the future due to business growth. Recall that if the objective is to replace the business owner\u2019s income in the event of their death, the income to be replaced is the net, after-tax or \u201ctake home\u201d pay \u2013 not the gross business income. 10.2.3 Retirement \u00b6 Retirement often means that the need to replace employment income may end. 10.2.3.1 Time to retirement \u00b6 Many people, especially professionals, work past age 65. Therefore, their survivors may continue to have a need for income replacement until the time the life insured is expected to stop work. Retirees may also need life insurance, especially if death will cause a retirement pension to be reduced for a surviving spouse. Case Study Derek plans to retire at age 65. He would like to ensure that he has enough life insurance to replace his income for the next 18 years if he dies prematurely. 10.2.3.2 Retirement income sources \u00b6 The potential sources of retirement income should be considered when going through an insurance needs analysis. A defined benefit pension plan would provide survivor benefits: Pension plan legislation requires plans to provide the surviving spouse with a pension after the plan member dies. Its amount is generally between 60%-66% of the amount that would be received by the plan member; With a defined contribution plan, if the plan member used the money to buy an annuity, the survivor might not receive a benefit. Government retirement pensions: If the life insured is entitled to receive CPP and OAS, survivors may be eligible to receive survivor benefits from both the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS), in addition to his or her own CPP and OAS benefits. 10.3 Assess current financial situation \u00b6 The life agent needs to get a clear picture of the life insured\u2019s existing financial situation, in order to identify: Assets that are available to meet estate needs; Debts that may come due at death; The amount of income the household receives now, and how this might change upon the death of the life insured; How much of current income is spent to meet current needs, and how much is saved; and How much cash flow is available to meet life insurance premiums. 10.3.1 Assets \u00b6 What assets are available to contribute to financial need? Assets are the property owned by an individual; either personally or in a form \u201cjoint tenants with right of survivorship.\u201d A life insurance needs analysis should consider all property owned by the life insured that could be used to address estate objectives, may have a corresponding liability (such as a mortgage against a home), and could result in a tax liability for the estate. The agent must assess the value of all assets and differentiate between assets that could be sold to increase the survivor\u2019s base of capital, and assets the survivor would prefer not to sell. For example, a survivor might have no emotional attachment to a rental property owned by the deceased. Selling the property could contribute significantly to the survivor\u2019s need for income. However, the survivor might be very reluctant to sell a family heirloom clock despite its value in the tens of thousands of dollars. 10.3.1.1 Liquid assets \u00b6 A liquid asset is cash or property that can be quickly and easily converted to cash, without any loss in value. For example, a chequing account is a liquid asset. Liquid assets are needed to pay immediate expenses created by death, such as funeral and/or burial costs and personal debts. Liquid assets will also provide an immediate contribution towards income replacement. When there are not enough liquid assets to cover expenses, fixed assets (such as real estate and vehicles) have to be sold and sold quickly. Case Study Derek and Becky use their tax-free savings accounts (TFSAs) to hold their emergency fund. They each have about $25,000 in their TFSAs, invested in a combination of money market funds and cashable guaranteed investment certificates (GICs). They also have $20,000 in their joint chequing account. They only invest in their TFSAs if Derek receives a year-end bonus. 10.3.1.2 Fixed assets \u00b6 Fixed assets are valuable property whose sale will produce cash. They include real estate, vehicles, jewellery, expensive furniture, boats, etc. To attract a buyer and complete the sale quickly, the price of the asset may be reduced to less than its market value. In this case, it will contribute less to needs than previous planning may have indicated. Case Study Derek and Becky jointly own a house valued at $550,000 (ACB of $425,000). Derek has a new car worth $45,000 while Becky\u2019s used family van is worth $10,000. Derek also owns a cottage valued at $600,000 (ACB of $250,000) that he inherited from his father that he hopes to pass on to Jordan, Anya and Robbie someday. He also owns 3 vintage cars that could easily be sold for a total of $72,000 (ACB $60,000), which he suspects Becky would sell upon his death. 10.3.1.3 Investment assets \u00b6 Investment assets generate and store wealth for future use, and are created by using savings to buy: Corporate shares; Bonds; Rental real estate; Segregated funds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds; Other financial instruments. Investment assets may be held in a registered account, such as a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) or a non-registered account. Registered accounts may roll over to a spouse without creating a tax liability. Non-registered accounts held in a joint form of ownership may also roll over to the other joint owner without a tax liability. Otherwise, if there is not a tax-free rollover, the full value of the investment will be included in the final tax return for the deceased. Thus, it is important to record the ACB and the fair market value (FMV) of investment assets, as well as the intended beneficiary. Case Study Derek has a non-registered investment portfolio in a diverse mix of equities. The portfolio has an FMV of $280,000 and an ACB of $162,000. It generates after-tax income of $7,200 annually. He has $89,000 in his personal self-directed RRSP, and he has been contributing to a spousal RRSP for Becky. There is $36,000 in the spousal RRSP, and Becky has her own RRSP worth $24,000. They only contribute to the RRSPs in years Derek earns a bonus. 10.3.1.4 Pension entitlements \u00b6 If the life insured or the spouse is a member of an employer-sponsored pension plan, current entitlements and survivor benefits under the plan should be factored into the insurance needs analysis. Case Study Derek is a member of his employer\u2019s DCPP. To date, his account is worth $180,000 (including his contributions, those of his employer, and accumulated investment income). Becky is the designated beneficiary of this account. If Derek dies before retirement, the funds will roll over into a locked-in retirement account, which Becky can access upon reaching age 55. 10.3.1.5 Case study summary of assets \u00b6 Chapter 11 Recommending an insurance policy will be using the information collected so far about Derek\u2019s and Becky\u2019s assets and is summarized in Table 10.1. 10.3.2 Debts \u00b6 A life insurance needs analysis must consider debt as well as assets. Assets may be owned outright or a creditor may be involved. Debt obligations must be taken into consideration since they increase the amount of insurance coverage needed, as creditors may demand repayment upon the death of the borrower. As well, the payments towards the debt limit the cash flow available to fund estate planning objectives. Just as assets are totalled for their contribution to net worth and income, so too must all debts be totalled. 10.3.2.1 Mortgage \u00b6 A mortgage is often the single largest debt of a homeowner. A mortgage must be discharged (paid off) before the property can be bequeathed. Spouses are usually co-owners and mortgagees of property. A surviving spouse must have the financial ability to continue mortgage payments. Often, the life insured will want to ensure the surviving family can continue to own and live in the family home and when going through the insurance needs analysis will take this into consideration so that there is enough insurance to cover the amount owed on the mortgage. If adequate life insurance is not in place, a survivor might have to sell their home because they could not make mortgage payments. Case Study Derek and Becky have just renegotiated the $350,196 mortgage on their house, resulting in payments of $1,800 monthly over the 25-year amortization period. Given Becky\u2019s current lack of income, Derek would like the mortgage to be paid off if he dies. 10.3.2.2 Credit cards and lines of credit \u00b6 Insurance coverage should also be sufficient to pay off credit card debt and all lines of credit. Note that lenders may allow a credit card or line of credit accounts to remain open in the event of the death of one spouse if the account was held jointly, but may reduce the amount of available credit to reflect the surviving spouse\u2019s income only. Case Study Derek and Becky do not have a line of credit and, while they sometimes charge as much as $3,000 to their credit cards in one month, they usually pay the balance in full to avoid interest charges. 10.3.2.3 Other loans \u00b6 Loans extended by creditors, such as a loan taken out to buy a car, must usually be paid off on the death of the borrower. A life insured may also have an outstanding demand loan, which is a loan for which the lender may demand repayment in full at any time. Demand loans typically have no predetermined repayment schedule, and may only require the borrower to make interest payments. Demand loans are often used by investors to leverage their investments. Case Study Derek has a car loan with a balance of $41,000, with payments of $620 monthly for the next 72 months. He would like this loan to be paid off if he dies. 10.3.2.4 Case study summary of liabilities \u00b6 Chapter 11 Recommending an insurance policy will be using the information collected thus far about Derek\u2019s and Becky\u2019s liabilities, summarized in Table 10.2. 10.3.3 Tax liability upon death \u00b6 A tax liability can arise upon death for: Income earned in the year of death; Capital gains on property inherited by someone other than the spouse; Probate taxes on property passed on through the will, except in Alberta and Qu\u00e9bec; The life insurance needs analysis should ensure there is adequate life insurance coverage for tax liabilities. Case Study Derek has a number of assets that have the potential to result in a tax liability upon death, depending on the designated beneficiary. Any nonregistered property transferred to Becky can roll over, without triggering a taxable capital gain. Similarly, registered plans such as Derek\u2019s TFSA, RRSPs and pension entitlement can transfer into registered plans for Becky if he designates her as the beneficiary. Perhaps the biggest concern is the family cottage that he wants to pass on to the children. If he leaves the cottage to the children, either directly or through a trust, it could trigger a taxable capital gain of $175,000 based on its current value, calculated as: (FMV of $600,000 \u2013 ACB of $250,000) \u00d7 capital gains inclusion rate of 50% If Becky decides to sell Derek\u2019s vintage car collection, this would also result in a taxable capital gain. 10.3.4 Current expenses \u00b6 Spending patterns could change when the life insured dies. Less may be needed for certain expenses. For example, there may no longer be a need for two cars. And more may be needed for other expenses, for instance if the surviving spouse must now pay for the cost of childcare that was previously provided by the deceased spouse. How expenses will change if the life insured dies should be taken into consideration when analyzing insurance needs. 10.3.5 Available cash flow \u00b6 Cash flow = net income coming in - cash going out - Cash flow determines whether\u2014and how much\u2014cash is available for life insurance premiums. - It is calculated as net income (that is, take-home pay) minus expenses. - A positive cash flow means the family can afford to increase expenses, such as buying life insurance. Case Study With Derek\u2019s take-home pay of $8,400 per month, they appear to have a small shortfall of $160 per month. However, Derek has indicated that until he receives his anticipated raise in two years, he is willing to use the after-tax investment income from his non-registered investments ( $7,200 per year or $600 per month) to cover the shortfall, as well as any required insurance premiums. While Becky and Derek both agree that it is important for her to remain home until Robbie is in school, they are looking forward to the day in about six years when she can return to work and bring in additional income. 10.4 Assess existing insurance \u00b6 The next part of an insurance needs analysis requires the life agent to identify and assess any existing insurance in place. 10.4.1 Individual insurance \u00b6 What life insurance does the life insured already own? This could be a combination of personally owned policies, or coverage provided through a group life plan at work or through membership in an organization or association. If the life insured already has one or more individual insurance policies in place, the life agent should note the following: Case Study When Jordan was born, Derek (who was 39 at the time) bought a 10-year term policy with a $250,000 level death benefit. Originally the policy named Susan as the beneficiary, but when they divorced he made his estate the beneficiary. The policy has a double indemnity rider for accidental death and is renewable and convertible to age 70. It does not include any other riders. His current premiums are based on standard health rates and are $250 per year. The policy is due to renew in two years. The annual renewal rates at age 49, 59 and 69 are $1,125, $2,625 and $6,875 respectively. 10.4.2 Business insurance \u00b6 Does the life insured have coverage through association with a business (such as key person insurance), or through ownership of a business? Note that business insurance may be structured so that the business is the beneficiary of any policy. 10.4.2.1 Relationship to buy-sell agreement \u00b6 A buy-sell agreement may specify that life insurance is required to be in place for each of the parties to cover the obligation for the surviving owner(s) to buy the business interest of a deceased owner or partner. The insurance may be purchased by the individual shareholders or partners or by the business itself. 10.4.2.2 Type of policy \u00b6 The buy-sell agreement can be based on term or permanent insurance. Term insurance will help minimize costs while permanent insurance will ensure that coverage remains in place for an indefinite period of time. Also with permanent insurance, the cash surrender value would be available to be used by the business. A policy used as collateral for a business loan can usually be term, with a period of coverage equivalent to the length of the loan. 10.4.2.3 Ownership of policy and payment of premiums \u00b6 The policyholder for a business policy may be the business. Under a cross-purchase agreement, the business owners buy insurance on the other owners personally. A key employee covered in a split-dollar arrangement will need to determine which portion of the death benefit - the face amount and any value in excess of the face amount - belongs to him or her and will be paid to their personal beneficiary. If the business wants to protect itself from the loss of a key employee while also offering the employee access to a tax-deferred investment vehicle, the business would own the face amount, and the employee would own the cash value. In this case, the business\u2019s share of the premiums would be tied to the reasonable costs for comparable term insurance coverage, and the employee would pay the balance of the premiums. 10.4.3 Group insurance \u00b6 As noted above, group insurance can contribute a death benefit. The life insured may be the group plan member, or they may be covered as a dependant. 10.4.3.1 Face amount \u00b6 What is the group plan face amount? Coverage provided by the group plan must be analyzed for its: Basic death benefit; Possible increase in the basic benefit due to a link to salary or by length of service, or by accidental death; Possible decrease due to age; Option for an increase in coverage. 10.4.3.2 Policyholder and conditions of membership \u00b6 It is important to note that the group plan member is not the policyholder of the group policy and, therefore, has no control over: Whether premiums for the policy will be paid; Whether the policyholder will continue to provide the plan. As a result of changes in personal circumstances or in the group plan, the life insured may fail to meet the conditions for continued membership in the plan, resulting in the death benefit is no longer available. 10.4.3.3 End date and convertibility \u00b6 When will group coverage end? There may be an end date to coverage under a group plan, for example if coverage ends at retirement. Conversion to a personal policy with equal, higher or lesser coverage may be feasible if the plan is terminated or the plan member retires. It may be possible to convert spousal or dependant coverage as well - review Section 6.6. Case Study Derek has group life insurance equal to one time his annual salary through his employer\u2019s group plan. It is convertible to the same amount of individual term coverage upon leaving the plan. 10.4.3.4 Vulnerabilities \u00b6 What are the weaknesses of the group plan? Its many limitations must be taken into consideration. Foremost among these is the limited amount of coverage, the lack of control for group plan members, and whether the policyholder might discontinue the plan. In addition, although coverage is usually convertible to an individual insurance policy, the premiums upon conversion are not guaranteed. 10.4.4 Government benefits \u00b6 While government benefits upon death are not usually sufficient to address all of an individual\u2019s insurance needs, they are still worth noting. 10.4.4.1 Canada Pension Plan (CPP) survivor benefits \u00b6 Upon the death of a person who has contributed to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), provided that the person meets CPP eligibility requirements, the person\u2019s estate or one or surviving family members may be eligible to receive one or more of the following benefits: The person\u2019s estate, surviving spouse and children (or their guardians) must apply for these benefits; they are not paid automatically. Case Study Derek has been making the maximum CPP contributions for about 20 years and meets the eligibility requirements for survivor benefits. 10.4.4.2 Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan benefits (QPP) \u00b6 What is the difference between CPP and QPP? QPP benefits are the same as CPP benefits except: The death benefit is paid for the contributor\u2019s actual funeral expenses to a maximum of $2,500. Therefore, if funeral expenses were $1,000, the death benefit would be $1,000; Surviving spouses, younger than 45 with dependent children, receive a different sum as a survivor\u2019s pension. *All amounts are maximum monthly amounts, with the exception of the death benefit, which is paid as a one-time lump sum. 10.4.4.3 Old Age Security (OAS) allowance for surviving spouse \u00b6 Canada\u2019s Old Age Security (OAS) program provides for an allowance to be paid to a low-income surviving spouse of an OAS pensioner, provided that the surviving spouse is between the ages of 60 and 64. The maximum allowance is $1,388.92 per month (2020), but it is reduced by $1 for every $2 of other income. Once the recipient reaches the maximum age for receiving the allowance, she will begin receiving her own OAS benefits. 10.4.4.4 Workers\u2019 Compensation (WC) benefits \u00b6 Workers\u2019 Compensation programs are provincially delivered programs to protect employees from financial hardship due to injury at work or occupational diseases. Employers are required to pay premiums into the program, at rates based on their own risk and safety records, in comparison with provincial averages. Each province has their own WC board, and the federal government has a separate WC board for federal employees. The benefits, paid to the surviving spouse or children, can vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but typically include the following types of payments: Funeral costs, ranging from $4,000 to an unlimited amount; An immediate lump sum, ranging from $2,000 to over $100,000; Monthly pensions for the surviving spouse and/or children that range from as little as $400 per month for a child to 85% of the deceased\u2019s net earnings for a surviving spouse with children. It is important to remember that these benefits are only payable if death is caused by a work-related accident or illness. 10.5 Identify client\u2019s priorities in the event of death \u00b6 So far, this chapter has focused mainly on facts and numbers, however, the agent must also understand that the qualitative questions are as important. 10.5.1 Family lifestyle \u00b6 Planning should ensure that the lifestyle enjoyed by survivors would not be diminished by death of the proposed life insured whether the husband, wife, partner, or parent. Some of the quality-of-life issues to be considered include: How and where will children be cared for? Is the surviving spouse likely to be dependent or will he return to work? Is there a need for a surviving spouse to update their education and training to become employable? Will the family continue to live in its principal home? Should the mortgage be paid off? Is there a second home or homes to which the family is attached? Should planning be based on keeping that home in the family? Is there a family business with plans to pass it on to children? If so, how will the tax liability resulting from the deemed disposition on death be paid? Case Study Derek wants Becky to be able to carry through with their plans to have her stay at home until Robbie is in school full-time. At that time, he knows she will be ready to return to work, but her earnings will not be enough to maintain their current standard of living. Thus, he would like to ensure that she has enough money to replace his income for the next six years, plus enough to supplement her anticipated income to the same level, until retirement at age 60. He also wants all of their debts to be paid off if he dies. Derek wants to fulfill his commitments for spousal and child support for Susan and Jordan and, while he believes Becky would honour his wishes, he would prefer not to have to involve her in these payments after his death. Finally, Derek wants to ensure that the title to his cottage can pass on to his children, by having enough funds in his estate to pay the income tax that would result upon his death. 10.5.2 Final expenses \u00b6 Funerals may be small, modest affairs or quite expensive. The agent needs to verify with the client the type of funeral the life insured would like to have, in order to ensure funds are available and sufficient to meet the desired type. Case Study Derek does not want an extravagant funeral. He believes $20,000 will be more than adequate to cover his final expenses. 10.5.3 Plans for future \u00b6 As part of the insurance needs analysis people may want to think about the future. What events are likely to occur, and add financial strain? For example, the costs of post-secondary education, formal weddings, and long-term care are three considerable expenses. If the life insured has died before these events, will the survivor have enough money to pay, or contribute to, their costs? The death benefit may also be required to pay large lump sums as legacies and for charitable giving. Case Study Derek and Becky believe it is their job to prepare the children for adulthood by helping them afford a quality post-secondary education, without necessarily covering the entire cost. Beyond that, they have no intention of providing the children with capital for a home or business. They already contribute to an RESP for each child, and as long as he can ensure that his income will be replaced if he dies, Becky can continue to make these contributions. He believes that another $10,000 for each child will be sufficient to cover their educational expenses. If possible, Derek would also like to make a charitable donation of $100,000 to his local hospice if he dies, because this organization recently provided excellent end-of-life care to his father.","title":"Chapter 10 Assessing the Clients Situation.md"},{"location":"life/Chapter_10_Assessing_the_Clients_Situation/#chapter-10-assessing-the-clients-situation","text":"","title":"Chapter 10: Assessing the Client\u2019s Situation"},{"location":"life/Chapter_10_Assessing_the_Clients_Situation/#100-assessing-the-clients-situation-case-study","text":"The concepts in this chapter, as well as Chapter 11, will be illustrated using a case study focusing on Derek and Becky\u2019s family, who are introduced below.

Derek and his previous wife, Susan (aged 44), divorced four years ago, and they share joint custody of a son, Jordan (age 8). Prior to marrying Derek, Becky was a single mother to Anya (aged 4). Derek formally adopted Anya when they got married. Derek and Becky have just had a child together; Robbie is two months old. Derek and Becky are concerned about securing their financial future in the event that Derek dies, and they have approached a licensed life insurance agent to help them assess their insurance needs.","title":"10.0 Assessing the client\u2019s situation case study"},{"location":"life/Chapter_10_Assessing_the_Clients_Situation/#101-assess-the-family-dynamics","text":"Many people use life insurance to provide financial support for their families upon their death.

There is an expectation that when people are married, either as legal or common-law spouses, the income earners in the family will arrange their affairs so that their spouse, and children, will be supported financially if they die. The amount of support would depend on the nature of the relationship and the surviving beneficiary\u2019s own financial capacity. For example, if there is a primary income earner (i.e., a single-income household), that individual would become the proposed life insured in a life insurance policy, and the spouse would be the beneficiary. In dual-income households, the surviving spouse may earn enough to be fully self-sufficient if one spouse dies.","title":"10.1.1 Current spouse"},{"location":"life/Chapter_10_Assessing_the_Clients_Situation/#10111-dependent-vs-self-sufficient","text":"A sole income earner for the family will usually need to replace his or her entire income for the surviving spouse\u2019s use or to help cover childcare expenses if the spouse were to return to work.

Case Study Derek is employed full-time as the Vice President of Industrial Design for a manufacturing company, with take-home pay (i.e., income after taxes and deductions) of $8,400 per month. Becky currently stays home caring for Jordan, Anya and Robbie, but she intends to return to work as a human resources manager once Robbie is in school full-time, about six years from now.

However, Derek feels that, if he dies, he would prefer that Becky would not have to return to work until Robbie is 18, if at all possible. If Derek were to die today, the family would obviously suffer from the loss of his income and, even if Becky could return to work immediately upon his death, her income would be insufficient to maintain the family\u2019s current standard of living.","title":"10.1.1.1 Dependent vs. self-sufficient"},{"location":"life/Chapter_10_Assessing_the_Clients_Situation/#1012-support-obligation-to-ex-spouses","text":"An ex-spouse may require financial support.

The life insurance death benefit must be calculated based on the monthly support obligation multiplied by the period of time for which support has been ordered. For example, the monthly support obligation is $1,000 and it is ordered to last for 16 years. The policy death benefit must be a minimum of $192,000 ( $1,000 \u00d7 (16 \u00d7 12)). Case Study Derek and Susan used a mediator to develop their spousal support agreement, which specifies that Derek must pay spousal support of $500 per month until Susan reaches age 65 or she remarries, whichever occurs first.

And, as is obvious, the chance of death increases with age. *Source: Statistics Canada. LLife expectancy and other elements of the life table, Canada, all provinces except Prince Edward Island (Table 13-10-0114-01, 2014 to 2018). [online]. Revised May 31, 2019. [Consulted August 10, 2020]. https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310011401 - To determine the odds simply divide 1 by the probability of death. Case Study Derek is currently 47 years old, while Becky is only 38. Based on the same data set that was used to produce Table 11.2 (i.e., an average for all Canadian males and females), Derek\u2019s probability of dying before his next birthday is 0.231%, which represents odds of 1 in 433. Becky\u2019s probability of dying before her next birthday is 0.062%, which represents odds of 1 in 1,613. Another approach is to present the probability of death occurring before a certain age. 11.1.1.2 Personal and family health history \u00b6 Health problems experienced by the individual, or conditions that appear to be genetic, may impact the probability of death. Case Study Derek\u2019s father and two of his uncles were diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes before the age of 50. His father is still living at age 72, but both uncles died in their early 60s. While Derek is fine so far and of average health, he knows that he is overweight and that he is predisposed to develop the same disease. This will increase his odds of dying before his next birthday. 11.1.1.3 Lifestyle risks \u00b6 The lifestyle choices people make affect their probability of death, such as: Smoking; Substance abuse; Bad driving habits; Frequent travel, especially to certain countries; Hazardous avocations. 11.1.2 Financial impacts of death \u00b6 It is essential for the agent to help the client understand who would be affected by the death of the client and in what ways? If income was lost, how would survivors support themselves? If a caregiver was lost, could the survivor afford the cost of care in order to go to work? If there are debts, such as a mortgage on the family home, how will they be repaid? How will income taxes resulting from the deemed disposition of property at death be paid? How will funeral expenses and other expenses relating to death be paid? Case Study The biggest financial impact associated with Derek\u2019s death would be the loss of his employment income, which currently amounts to $8,400 per month after-tax. His death may also result in the calling of their $350,196 mortgage and his $41,000 car loan, meaning that payment would be required in full, and the passing of the cottage to his children may result in a tax liability of $175,000. 11.1.3 Duration of risk \u00b6 The insurance agent needs to understand how long will the financial ramifications resulting from the death of the client last. Some risks are of a limited duration; others are lifelong. For instance, a car loan may be paid off in four years. Child support obligations last until the child is at least 18 years of age\u201422 or 23 if enrolled in post-secondary education and dependent\u2014lifelong if the child is dependent due to mental incapacity or physical disability. 11.1.4 Other risks \u00b6 There are other risks aside from death that the client could be exposed to, such as disability, illness and unemployment, which may impact the client\u2019s ability to pay the premiums on an insurance policy. 11.1.4.1 Risk of illness or disability \u00b6 The risk of disability for three months or longer is higher than the risk of death for all age groups. Disability can have as great an impact on family finances as death. If disability means the person is unable to work\u2014and earn an income\u2014financial hardship may ensue. This is particularly true for those who are self-employed or sole proprietors. Adding a waiver of premium benefit or a dread disease rider to a client\u2019s life insurance policy will help the client keep the policy in force should the client be unable to earn an income due to illness or disability. 11.1.4.2 Risk of unemployment \u00b6 What are the chances that the policyholder will lose his job, and be unable to pay premiums? Job instability can be managed by choice of a policy with premium flexibility, such as a whole life policy with automatic premium loans or UL. 11.2 Insurance needs analysis \u2013 Income replacement approach \u00b6 From an insurance perspective, income replacement approach is reflected by the loss of employment income that would result from the death of an income earner. This approach strives to replace that lost income and it assumes that as long as this income can be replaced, the surviving family will not experience a reduction in their standard of living. Case Study Derek is currently the sole income earner for the family. A life insurance needs analysis based on the income replacement approach would determine the value of the income that would be lost upon his death. If the life insured played an essential non-income-earning role in the family, such as that of a caregiver, that individual\u2019s contribution can be expressed in terms of what it would cost to replace that service. Where the life insured provides an essential but unpaid function, his contribution can be expressed in terms of what it would cost to replace that essential service, or income-in kind. Case Study Becky currently stays home to care for Anya and Robbie, as well as Jordan when he is with Derek (recall that Derek and his ex-wife Susan share joint custody of Jordan). While Becky\u2019s death would not result in a loss of income, her role as caregiver still has economic value. A life insurance needs analysis based on the income replacement approach would determine the cost of replacing her duties as a caregiver and homemaker. 11.2.1 Capitalization of lost income \u00b6 Under this approach, the insurance need is determined by calculating the lump-sum amount of capital that would need to be invested to generate the lost income. Capitalized value = annual income \u00f7 rate of return Calculations using this approach results in a higher insurance need. This method is also referred to as the capital retention method because it assumes that the principal always remains intact. It is only the income generated by investing the principal that is used by the beneficiary and not the principal itself. Thus, the income stream lasts in perpetuity. Case Study Derek currently takes home $8,400 per month. Assuming a rate of return of 5%, the capitalized value of his lost income would be $2,016,000, calculated as: $2,016,000 = ( $8,400/month \u00d7 12 months) \u00f7 5%. This suggests that he should have about $2 million in life insurance. 11.2.2 Impact of investment returns, inflation and income tax \u00b6 The approach described assumes that return earned on the invested death benefit will remain constant over time. To protect against changing investment returns, a conservative interest rate should be used. Also, the approach so far fails to consider the impact of income taxes or inflation on income. 11.2.2.1 Accounting for income taxes \u00b6 Life insurance proceeds are not taxable when received. However, the resulting income from invested life insurance proceeds is taxable. In terms of income replacement, lost income may be expressed either as a gross salary, or an after-tax amount, and the capitalization of income should be calculated on the same basis. Thus, if the lost income is expressed as an after-tax amount, the interest rate used when calculating the capitalization of income should also be an after-tax amount, using an appropriate tax rate: The MTR should be used if the income amount is small, relative to the recipient\u2019s other sources of income; and The average tax rate should be used if the income amount is large. Case Study Derek has after-tax income of $8,400 per month or $100,800 per year. Therefore, the investment income earned on the death benefit needs to be calculated on an after-tax basis. The after-tax rate of return is calculated as follows: After-tax rate of return = rate of return \u00d7 (1 \u2013 tax rate) If the investment return is 5% and average tax rate is 25%, the after-tax rate of return is 3.75%, calculated as: 3.75% = 5% \u00d7 (1 \u2013 25%) This means that, using the replacement of income approach, adjusted for income taxes, Derek would need $2,688,000 in life insurance, calculated as: $2,688,000 = ( $8,400/month \u00d7 12 months) \u00f7 3.75% 11.2.2.2 Accounting for inflation \u00b6 Inflation is defined as the increase in prices over time. The effects of inflation result in a fall in the purchasing value of money: with the same amount of money, one can buy fewer goods now compared to one year ago. Case Study If Derek\u2019s employment income increases at a rate of just 2% a year, the $8,400 per month he takes home today will increase to $10,240 in 10 years, which is a significant difference. As the inflation rate is 2% per year and the investment return is 5% per year, the inflation-adjusted rate of return is 2.9%, calculated as: This means that using the replacement of income approach, adjusted for inflation, Derek would need $3,428,571 in life insurance, calculated as: $3,428,571 = ( $8,400/month \u00d7 12 months) \u00f7 2.94%. The approach also assumes that the income being replaced is fixed over time. In reality, this is not the case as an individual\u2019s salary usually increases over time. The following calculation for capitalized value addresses the issue which takes inflation into account. It is called the inflation-adjusted rate of return. 11.2.2.3 Accounting for income taxes and inflation simultaneously \u00b6 Both income taxes and inflation will affect the amount of capital needed. The after-tax, after-inflation rate of return should be used in order to account for both factors: Case Study Previously it was determined that if the investment return is 5% per year and taxes are 25%, the after-tax rate of return is 3.75%. If the inflation rate is 2%, the after-tax, after-inflation rate of return is %, calculated as: This means that using the capitalization of income approach, adjusted for income taxes and inflation, Derek would need $5,894,737 in life insurance, calculated as: [( $8,400 per month \u00d7 12 months) \u00f7 1.71%] 11.2.3 Weaknesses of the income replacement approach \u00b6 The income replacement approach has the benefit of simplicity, but it fails to address: What the survivors actually need; How long the lost income would have been generated if the life insured had not died; nor The life insured\u2019s desire to create or protect an estate. 11.3 Insurance needs analysis \u2013 Capital needs approach \u00b6 This approach is based on the actual needs of survivors for capital. It identifies all of the income and capital needs arising as a result of death and converts them into a capitalized amount at death. This approach starts by listing the surviving family\u2019s sources of income, then comparing them with their expenses, to determine if a shortfall exists. A shortfall is an indication of how much insurance coverage is needed. 11.3.1 Income earned by survivors \u00b6 Income earned by surviving family may be earned from employment income, pensions or investment income, or government benefits. Case Study Becky does not currently work, and she does not expect to return to work for at least 6 years, at which time she believes that her take-home pay would be about $4,500 per month. However, Derek would feel better if he knew that she could manage the household financially without working until Robbie turns 18. Neither of them currently earns investment or pension income. Case Study (cont.) If Derek dies, Becky would be eligible for a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) survivor benefit of about $638 per month, and all 3 of the children would be eligible for a CPP benefit of about $255 per month as children of a deceased CPP contributor. Derek wants to ignore any potential benefits his family could receive under his province\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Board because there is no guarantee that his death will be work-related. Derek\u2019s non-registered investment portfolio currently produces after-tax income of $7,200 annually, but because these assets may be needed to meet estate expenses, this income is not being included at this point. 11.3.2 Ongoing expenses \u00b6 What expenses might continue after the death of the proposed life insured? Expenses can fall into four categories: Increasing expenses over time, such as property taxes; Decreasing expenses over time, such as childcare as children grow up; Level expenses that stay the same, such as a set dollar amount paid to a charity; Be eliminated, such as debts that would be paid off by the death benefit. Case Study Derek has indicated that he would like to see all of his debts paid in full upon his death, which means Becky will not have to worry about mortgage or car payments. Derek also wants to handle the support obligations separately, so they will not form part of Becky\u2019s budget if he dies. In addition, some of their expenses, such as gas, car insurance, and food, will decrease slightly upon his death. The table below shows a modified version of the summary of expenses that was provided in Chapter 10 Assessing the client\u2019s situation, showing both current expenses, and how they would likely change as a result of Derek\u2019s death. 11.3.3 Income shortfall \u00b6 If the income is less than the expenses, then an income shortfall exists, calculated as follows: Income shortfall = expenses - income Case Study Factoring in the CPP survivor benefits ( $638 monthly for Becky and $255 monthly for the each of the children), if Derek dies, the family would experience a shortfall of $2,747 per month, calculated as: $2,747 = $4,150 \u2013 ( $638 + $255 + $255 + $255) 11.3.3.1 Capitalization of income shortfall \u00b6 Once the shortfall is determined, the next step is to calculate the amount of capital that would be needed at death to cover the shortfall. Two methods can be used: The capital retention method; The capital drawdown method. The capital retention method was demonstrated above and is used when the intent is to preserve the capital of the death benefit and replace income, where: Capitalization of shortfall = annual shortfall \u00f7 investment return For greater accuracy, the investment return used should be the after-tax and inflation-adjusted rate of return. Case Study Previously it was determined that if the inflation rate is 2% per year, the investment return is 5%, and the average tax rate is 25%, then the after-tax, after-inflation rate of return is 1.71%. Using the capital retention method, the capitalized value of Derek\u2019s family\u2019s income shortfall would be $1,927,719, calculated as: $1,927,719 = ( $2,747/month \u00d7 12 months) \u00f7 1.71%. A more practical approach for needs that have a limited duration is to multiply the annual shortfall by the number of years the shortfall is expected. This is called the \u201ccapital drawdown method.\u201d Case Study Derek has indicated that he would prefer that Becky would not have to return to work until Robbie turns 18. At that time, she could find work and likely take home enough money to cover all of her expenses. Using the capital drawdown method, the capitalized value of the family\u2019s shortfall over 18 years would be $598,968, calculated as: $593,352 = ( $2,747/month \u00d7 12 months) \u00d7 18. Any other ongoing expenses, such as support obligations to a previous family, could be handled in a similar manner. Case Study Derek would like to ensure that his estate can provide spousal support to his ex-wife Susan of $500 per month for a maximum of 21 years (until Susan is aged 65). Using the capital drawdown method, this results in a capitalized value of $126,000, calculated as: $126,000 = $500/month \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 21 years. He also wants to ensure that his child support obligation of $1,000 per month can be met for 11 years (until Jordan is 19 years old). Using the drawdown method, the capitalized value of these support payments is $132,000, calculated as: $132,000 = ( $1,000/month \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 11 years). 11.3.4 Capital needs analysis \u00b6 The next step is to identify all of the other lump sum needs that may arise as a result of death, to ensure that the estate has enough liquidity to meet these needs. Other costs that may have to be considered as: Final expenses (funeral, burial, etc.); Tax liabilities; Debts (mortgage and loans); Estate expenses (such as probate fees, and legal fees); Emergency fund (to establish a liquid reserve fund equal to three to six months of living expenses); Education fund (to pay the costs of post-secondary education); Estate equalization (to ensure heirs receive equal sums from the estate); Charitable giving. 11.3.4.1 Final Expenses \u00b6 Final costs are the costs associated with a funeral, burial, cremation, visitation or remembrance services for the deceased. Case Study Derek has previously indicated that he believes that $20,000 will be sufficient to cover his final death expenses. Case Study (cont.) The cottage currently has an ACB of $250,000 and FMV of $600,000, which would result in a taxable capital gain of $175,000 if Derek died today, calculated as: (deemed proceeds \u2013 ACB) \u00d7 capital gains inclusion rate or ( $600,000 \u2013 $250,000) \u00d7 50 % If Derek\u2019s marginal tax rate for the year of death is 45%, the resulting tax liability would be $78,750. Note that if the cottage continues to appreciate in value prior to Derek\u2019s death (which is quite probable given historical increases), this tax liability would be even higher. 11.3.4.2 Tax Liabilities \u00b6 It has been previously mentioned that upon death the deemed disposition of capital assets and the deregistration of registered assets (unless a rollover provision is used) can result in a significant tax burden. If cash is not available to cover the tax liability, assets in the estate may have to be sold to provide the required funds. Case Study Derek plans to leave all of his assets, with the exception of the cottage, to Becky upon his death. He would like to leave the cottage in trust to the children upon his death, and this will result in a deemed disposition for tax purposes. 11.3.4.3 Debt Elimination \u00b6 A common objective in a life insurance needs analysis is to ensure that the estate has sufficient liquidity to pay off all debts owing at the time of death. Case Study Derek wants their mortgage of $ 350,196 and his car loan of $41,000 to be paid off if he dies. 11.3.4.4 Estate Expenses \u00b6 The estate will need enough cash to pay expense incurred by an estate, such as: Probate fees, which can be as high as 1.5% of estate assets, depending on the jurisdiction; Compensation for the executor or estate trustee, often in the order of 1 to 3% of estate assets; Legal fees, dependent upon the estate\u2019s needs; Asset management fees, particularly if the estate consists of a large investment portfolio; Property maintenance fees, if the estate includes real estate. Case Study Derek feels that his estate is fairly straightforward, and his brother has agreed to act as his executor without compensation. As a result, no provision has been made for estate expenses. 11.3.4.5 Emergency Fund \u00b6 As a rule of thumb, a family should have liquid assets, equivalent to three to six months of expenses, available as an emergency resource. While the life insured can have accumulated a sufficient emergency fund, it can be easily consumed upon death by final expenses, income taxes or other estate expenses, which could leave the surviving family without an emergency fund safety net. Case Study Derek and Becky currently have $25,000 each in their TFSAs, earmarked as their emergency fund, as well as $20,000 in their joint chequing account. Their monthly expenses are $8,560 (or $51,360 over 6 months), so their current emergency fund is adequate. However, they need to be careful that this does not get consumed by all of the expenses associated with Derek\u2019s death. Assuming that Becky\u2019s monthly expenses after Derek\u2019s death would be $4,150 (as shown in the Table, \u201cSummary of the family\u2019s monthly expenses, current and after death\u201d). Derek would like to ensure that 6 times this amount, or about $25,000, is maintained as an emergency fund. 11.3.4.6 Education Fund \u00b6 The capitalized value of anticipated education expenses is often included in the life insurance needs analysis. Case Study As discussed in Chapter 10 Assessing the client\u2019s situation, Derek feels that setting aside $10,000 for each of their 3 children, in addition to their RESP would be sufficient. He would like the capital needs analysis to include an education fund of $30,000. 11.3.4.7 Estate Equalization \u00b6 Sometimes the assets in a deceased\u2019s estate that are to be shared among family members (i.e., children) do not divide equally. Insurance can be used to help equalize the distribution of an estate so that from a value standpoint, each child receives an equal share of the estate. Case Study Suppose that Derek had decided to leave the cottage to Jordan only, perhaps because Jordan is the one who will likely use or enjoy it, or because Derek knows that Jordan, Anya and Robbie would not be able to manage it jointly without fighting (while the children in this case study are currently too young for these issues to arise, it is a common situation in other families). How would Anya and Robbie feel about their brother receiving sole title to an asset worth $600,000? Derek could perhaps alleviate conflict between the siblings if he bought sufficient life insurance to give $600,000 each to Anya and Robbie, thereby equalizing their treatment. 11.3.4.8 Charitable bequests and legacies \u00b6 A client may have special bequests or desires that they would like to do upon death, such as charitable giving, setting up a scholarship or endowment fund. These special bequests may be part of a tax strategy, or purely for philanthropic motivations. Case Study Derek has indicated that he would like to be able to donate $100,000 to the local hospice centre upon his death. 11.3.4.9 Total capital needs \u00b6 Once all of the capital needs have been identified, including the capitalized income shortfall, a total must be calculated. Case Study Derek\u2019s total capital needs in the event of death are summarized in the table below: 11.3.4.10 Assets available upon death \u00b6 Keep in mind that many assets may exist, but they may not be immediately available to cover expenses. Even if cash or cash equivalents are available, the survivor may not wish to use them, preferring instead to keep cash on hand. A summary of the family\u2019s assets was developed in the Chapter Assessing the client\u2019s situation, and is repeated in the table below, but many of these assets are not available to meet estate needs. Becky is the beneficiary of Derek\u2019s registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) and his defined contribution pension plan (DCPP), and he believes they should be preserved for her own retirement. She will continue to live in the house, and the cottage is to be held in trust for their children. Presumably, she will keep his newer car and sell her van. This leaves a much smaller asset base of $402,750, as summarized in the following table. 11.3.4.11 Existing Insurance \u00b6 A summary should also be made of existing insurance, its term, premiums, renewability and convertibility and, for permanent insurance, its cash surrender value, and ACB. Case Study Derek has an individual $250,000 10-year term life insurance policy that names his estate as the beneficiary. It is renewable and convertible until age 70. He is currently paying premiums of $240 per year, but the policy will renew in 2 years at age 49, with premiums of $1,125. Premiums at renewal at age 59 and 69 are $2,625 and $6,875 respectively. He also has $100,000 of coverage through his employer\u2019s group life insurance plan. 11.3.4.12 Shortfall \u00b6 The last step is to determine the shortfall in capital, which is calculated as: Capital shortfall = total capital needs at death - available assets - existing life insurance This shortfall represents the amount of additional insurance that should be acquired. It is normally rounded up to the nearest $10,000 or $50,000 amount. Case Study Using a capital needs approach with the capital drawdown method, Derek\u2019s capital shortfall is $754,240, calculated as: $754,240 = $1,506,990 \u2013 $402,750 \u2013 $250,000 \u2013 $100,000 Derek should therefore consider acquiring an additional $760,000 in life insurance. 11.4 Bringing it all together \u00b6 Once the insurance agent has determined if life insurance is needed, the next step is to evaluate what options are suitable for the client. A few more factors should be considered before a recommendation is made to the client, such as: Duration of risk; Investment needs; Cash flow available to pay insurance premiums; Additional coverage for spouse or dependants. 11.4.1 Duration of risk \u00b6 The duration of each capital need helps determine whether permanent or term insurance is required. Not all risks are lifelong, for example, a mortgage has a fixed term\u2014usually 25 years. Term insurance or a term rider on a permanent policy can best address risks in which a duration can be specified. Some risks create an obligation beyond the death of the life insured. For example, a disabled child may require care for his lifetime, which could extend for 30 years after the death of the life insured. The amount needed must be available when the life insured dies to ensure continued care. The need to pay taxes that arise on death makes a good case for permanent insurance. A proposed life insured may have a combination of risks for insurance to cover: some have a set term and some arise at death. 11.4.2 Investment needs \u00b6 Case Study Derek\u2019s capital needs may be term needs or permanent needs, as follows: Term needs : He wants to ensure that his family\u2019s income shortfall is covered until Robbie turns 18. After that time, he assumes Becky can support herself. His support obligation to his ex-wife, Susan, could last as long as 21 years unless she remarries prior to age 65. His support obligation for Jordan will last for 11 years. Their mortgage will be paid off in 25 years. Permanent needs: He would then like to be able to donate $100,000 to the local hospice centre upon his death, regardless of when that death occurs. The tax liability on the cottage inheritance will not arise until his death, which hope-fully will not be for another 30, 40 or even 50 years. Life insurance can be used as an investment for individuals looking for additional tax deferral opportunities beyond what is provided by an RRSP or TFSA. As well, life insurance can be used to transfer wealth to the next generation. Case Study Derek and Becky are not maximizing their RRSPs, and they are only making contributions to their TFSAs in years when Derek has a bonus. Their only current investment program involves their RESPs for the children. As a result, they do not appear to need additional investment opportunities. 11.4.3 Cash flow vs. premiums \u00b6 The best policy or the best amount of coverage may not be affordable for the policyholder. Sometimes a trade-off will be needed between the ideal type or amount of insurance, and the cash flow available to pay the premiums. A convertible term policy may provide a short-term solution and if income increases, the policy can then be converted to permanent insurance if the policy includes a conversion option. Also, if income fluctuates from time to time, a UL policy allows the policyholder to adjust the premiums to some degree. Case Study Remember in Chapter 10 Assessing the client\u2019s situation, it was determined that the family has current monthly expenses of $8,560, while Derek\u2019s take-home pay was $8,400 per month and his after-tax investment income was $600. As long as his non-registered investment portfolio continues to provide the same level of income, it appears that the family has about $440 per month to potentially spend for insurance purposes. Derek had also noted that his take-home pay might increase to $9,500 in 2 years, when he hopes to be promoted to chief operating officer. This would increase their cash flow in the future. 11.4.4 Coverage for spouse or dependants \u00b6 If the rest of the family does not have sufficient life insurance coverage, or if cash flow is an issue, there may be an opportunity - and it may be more affordable - to cover them under the same policy. For example: Some or all of the insurance could be done on a joint-first-to-die or joint-last-to-die basis on both spouses; The spouse and/or children could be covered under a family life rider. Case Study Derek and Becky do not currently have any insurance on Becky\u2019s life or on any of the children. Ideally, he would like coverage of at least $150,000 on Becky\u2019s life to help pay for childcare until the children are all in school full-time, and $10,000 on each of the children. 11.5 Making the recommendation \u00b6 The next step is to assess the various life insurance options and make a recommendation to the client. 11.5.1 Type of Coverage \u00b6 The agent must determine who the life insured will be, and the most appropriate type of policy based on the major risks as well as the appropriate term. More than one type of policy may be appropriate. If that is the case, riders can be added to supplement coverage or address specific needs. Case Study Derek\u2019s risks can be roughly categorized into three categories: Those that will disappear in about 10 years (child support for Jordan, car loan); Those that will disappear in 20 to 25 years (mortgage, income shortfall for Becky, spousal support); The tax liability on the inheritance of the cottage, which will be a permanent concern. The donation to the hospice, which will be a permanent concern. It would appear that Derek could use a combination of 20-year and/or 10-year term insurance policies to cover all needs except the tax liability on the cottage and the donation to the hospice. A cumulative cost comparison will be required to determine the most cost-effective option for him. Whole life insurance would be more appropriate than universal life for the tax liability and the donation to the hospice because at this point in time, Derek is not looking for additional investment opportunities and cash flow is limited. Note that while a joint-last-to-die policy is often used to cover the tax liability on a family asset being left to the children, it is not appropriate in this case because the cottage is to be held in trust for the children if Derek dies; there is no opportunity to roll it over to Becky and defer the taxable capital gain until her death. Therefore, all of Derek\u2019s life insurance should be on a single life basis. The coverage on Becky and children should be some form of term life insurance, and can be done via an individual policy on Becky with a child life rider, or as a family life rider on one of Derek\u2019s policies. Both options will be compared shortly. 11.5.2 Death benefits \u00b6 The agent needs to determine the appropriate death benefit. If multiple policies are proposed, each will have the death benefit specific to its policy objective. Case Study It has been determined that Derek needs a total of $760,000 in additional life insurance. This could be broken down as follows: While the taxability on the cottage is estimated to be $78,750 based on its current value, Derek is con-cerned the tax liability could be much higher because he expects the cottage to continue to appreciate in value. As a result, an amount of $200,000 for the permanent insurance policy would be appropriate to cover the cottage tax liability plus the $100,000 hospice donation. Selecting the paid-up additions (PUA) option for any dividend payments would provide further protection against increasing cottage values. Of the other financial needs, two of them will end within the next 10 years ( $132,000 in child support for Jordan and the car loan of $41,000). A $180,000 Term-10 policy should be used to cover these needs. Case Study (cont.) The balance of $380,000 ( $760,000 \u2013 $200,000 \u2013 $180,000) could be covered by either by a Term-20 policy, or a renewable Term-10 policy. A cost analysis should be performed to determine which would be most cost effective in the long run. Term coverage lasting, at least, five years is also needed on Becky\u2019s life, plus $10,000-term coverage on each of the 3 children. Derek also wanted to consider whether he should replace his existing $250,000 Term-10 policy before it is up for renewal in 2 years. 11.5.3 Premiums \u00b6 The premium for each policy and rider should be quoted, with the length of the payment period. The monthly and annual cost should be quoted, in addition to the cumulative cost of term recommendations. When premiums are too expensive, the following remedies are available: Reduce coverage; Consider convertible term instead of permanent; Look at underwriting factors that may have caused a higher premium. For example, could the life insured forego travel to Afghanistan? Look at the budget to see if other expenses could be reduced to free up more cash for premiums. Case Study Based on Derek\u2019s current age, health and smoking status, the following monthly rate would apply per $100,000 of coverage: Whole life with PUA, $325 for life; Term-10 renewable to age 85, $33 for first 10 years, $183 at age 57, $435 at age 67, $925 at age 77; Term-20 renewable to age 85, $60 for first 20 years, $540 at age 67. Cost of new insurance needed on Derek For the cottage liability and hospice donation, the $200,000 of whole life insurance will cost $650 per month. Derek has total term insurance needs of $560,000 ( $760,000 \u2013 $100,000 (cottage) \u2013 $100,000 (hospice donation)): $180,000 of coverage for his shorter term needs (i.e., child support and car loans will end within 10 years); $380,000 ( $760,000 \u2013 $200,000 \u2013 $180,000) in longer-term needs (i.e., spousal support, mortgage and Becky\u2019s income shortfall will end in about 20 years). So should Derek use renewable 10-year term (T-10), 20-year term (T-20), or a combination of both to cover these term needs? Performing a cumulative cost analysis can help as shown in the following table. At this point it is necessary to compare $560,000 of T-10 (Option A) or T-20 (Option B) renewable, dropping to $380,000 of coverage upon renewal, when his needs will have dropped. Remember, the premiums upon renewal will have already been set when he buys the policy. The cumulative cost analysis is provided below: Clearly if only one policy is to be used, the T-20 policy (Option B) works out better than the T-10 policy (Option A) in the long run, with a cumulative cost of $67,680 over 20 years, compared to $105,624 for the T-10 policy. However, notice the cumulative costs for each policy after the first 10 years, before the coverage drops to $380,000. At 10 years, the T-10 policy is the clear winner, with a cumulative cost-to-date of $22,176, compared to $40,320 for the T-20 policy. This reversal suggests that a combination of policies may be in Derek\u2019s best interests. At this point a cumulative cost comparison is useful between: Using a T-20 policy for the entire $560,000, dropping to $380,000 after 10 years (Option B as shown in the Table above); and Using a combination of a T-10 policy for the shorter-term needs of $180,000, along with a T-20 policy of $380,000 to cover the longer-term needs (Option C, shown below). The cumulative cost of this combination of policies over 20 years is only $61,850, compared to the $69,120 over 20 years for a single T-20 policy, or savings of about 10%. So given that Derek has 2 very distinct coverage periods (e.g., 10 years and 20 years) and is certain that some of his insurance needs are short term only, then a combination of T-10 and T-20 policies will be more cost effective in the long run. However, if he feels that his insurance needs may remain the same or even increase in the future, he may want to consider covering the entire amount with a single T-20 policy. Note that while spreadsheets help illustrate the point, the cumulative cost comparisons can usually be done very simply using a calculator, as follows: Option A Single $560,000 renewable T-10 policy, dropping to $380,000 after 10 years 1 st 10 years = $560,000 \u00f7 $100,000 \u00d7 $33/month \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 10 years = $22,176 2 nd 10 years = $380,000 \u00f7 $100,000 \u00d7 $183/month \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 10 years = $83,448 Cumulative cost over 20 years = $22,176 + $ 83,448 = $105,624 Case Study (cont.) Option B Single $560,000 T-20 policy, dropping to $380,000 after 10 years 1 st 10 years = $560,000 \u00f7 $100,000 \u00d7 $60/month \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 10 years = $40,320 2 nd 10 years = $380,000 \u00f7 $100,000 \u00d7 $60/month \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 10 years = $27,360 Cumulative cost over 20 years = $40,320 + $27,360 = $67,680 Option C $180,000 T-10 policy for 10 years, plus $380,000 T-20 policy for 20 years T-10 policy = $180,000 \u00f7 $100,000 \u00d7 $33/month \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 10 years $7,128 T-20 policy = $380,000 \u00f7 $100,000 \u00d7 $60/month \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 20 years $54,720 Cumulative cost of 20 years = $7,128 + $54,720 = $61,848 - Replace Derek\u2019s existing $250,000 policy? Derek has an existing $250,000 Term-10 policy that is due to renew in 2 years. He was shocked to realize how much the premiums will increase upon renewal (from $250 per year to $1,125 per year). Derek heard that it is often cheaper to shop for a new policy, rather than renew the old one, so he asked his agent to determine the cost of replacing his old policy. The results are provided in the table below, which shows that Derek would be better off keeping his existing policy. The reason the results were disappointing for Derek was that he became a smoker after the original policy was issued. The old policy will remain valid, even though Derek is now a smoker. This is one of the reasons premiums jump so much upon renewal because the life insured may no longer be in the fine health he was when the policy was first issued. Case Study (cont.) Insurance for Becky and the Children Derek wants to obtain $150,000 of life insurance coverage on Becky\u2019s life, and $10,000 on each of the children. This can be accomplished in one of two ways: Buying a stand-alone $150,000 Term-10 insurance policy on Becky, with a $10,000 child-life rider, which would have a total monthly premium of $23.54; Adding a family life rider to his whole-life insurance policy, with $150,000 of Term-10 coverage on Becky and $10,000 each on the children, which would have a total monthly premium of $19.04. The stand-alone policy is more expensive because it has a separate policy administration fee; this fee is not charged when the coverage is added as a rider to Derek\u2019s whole life policy. Total costs The total monthly cost of the recommended additional insurance is $956, as shown below This exceeds the $440 the family currently has in available cash flow, so they will have some decisions to make. A few of the possibilities include: - Reducing the amount of coverage, and accepting the fact that Becky may have to return to work before Robbie turns 18, and Derek will not be able to leave $100,000 to his favourite charity; - Obtaining term insurance with a conversion option for the tax liability on the cottage and the hospice donation, which would allow Derek to convert to permanent insurance once cash flow permits; - Scaling back on their other expenditures to increase the amount of cash flow they can devote to life insurance; - Depending on the policy of their insurance company, Derek may be able to apply for a decrease in premiums if he is able to stop smoking for at least a year. 11.5.4 Beneficiaries \u00b6 Based on understanding the client\u2019s situation, the agent may be able to recommend how the beneficiary designations should be structured\u2014for example, revocable or irrevocable. 11.5.4.1 Primary and contingent \u00b6 A primary beneficiary receives the death benefit so long as they survive the life insured. More than one primary beneficiary can be named. Multiple beneficiaries share the death benefit equally unless the policy has assigned a set dollar amount to each beneficiary. Beneficiaries can include: The estate of the policyholder, when the purpose is to pay the tax liabilities on the estate; The surviving spouse, if the funds are used to replace a source of income; Any person the policyholder chooses to name; A trustee for minor children, if the funds are to be used to support a minor child. Case Study With his $180,000-term life insurance policy, Derek could name Becky the beneficiary of $50,000 in order to reimburse his car loan and a testamentary trust as the beneficiary of $130,000, to provide child support for Jordan, with any remaining amount to be paid to Becky when Jordan turns 18. The agent should also encourage the applicant to specify one or more contingent beneficiaries. If the primary beneficiary does not survive the life insured, then the death benefit will pass to the contingent beneficiary. If no contingent beneficiary is named, then the death benefit will be paid to the policyholder, or if the policyholder is also the life insured, to his estate. Case Study If Derek names Becky as his beneficiary, he may want to name a testamentary trust for the children as a contingent beneficiary. If he and Becky die simultaneously, this will keep the funds from being part of his estate and being subject to probate. 11.5.4.2 Revocable or irrevocable \u00b6 In most Canadian jurisdictions, beneficiary designations are automatically revocable unless the application specifies otherwise. In Qu\u00e9bec, if the policyholder designates his spouse as the beneficiary, it is automatically irrevocable, unless the policyholder specifies that it is revocable when he first designates the spouse as his beneficiary. Naming an irrevocable beneficiary effectively puts control of the policy into the hands of the irrevocable beneficiary. An irrevocable beneficiary may be suitable when: The policyholder is named in a spousal or child support court order; Creditor protection is needed; A tax strategy in connection with charitable giving. 11.5.4.3 Probate implications \u00b6 A death benefit that is paid to the estate becomes subject to probate fees. Probate fees do not exist in Alberta or Qu\u00e9bec. It is good practice to name a beneficiary to avoid the death benefit being subjected to probate fees. Also, when an estate is subject to probate, the contents of the estate and the terms of the will become public knowledge. Probate fee varies across jurisdictions. The highest is 1.5%. The desire to avoid probate should never be a substitute for good planning. 11.5.5 Highlighting important clauses \u00b6 When reviewing a new policy, the life agent should ensure that the policyholder is aware of, and understands, certain key provisions. These are covered in more detail in the Module Ethics and professional practice. 11.5.5.1 Exclusions \u00b6 The agent has a responsibility to review any policy exclusions with the client and ensure that the client understands that the death benefit will not be paid under those circumstances. All policies have a two-year exclusion period for death by suicide after the policy issue date, or date of reinstatement for which the death benefit will not be paid Example Anne-Marie is an avid photographer and frequent traveller. When the insurance company inquired about her travels, she had disclosed that her most recent places of travel included Ethiopia, India, and South Africa. The policy was issued with an exclusion for death while travelling to Ethiopia, because of the perceived high incidence of disease and conflict at that time. The death benefit will be paid as long as her death does not occur in Ethiopia, and cannot be linked to an illness acquired from her travels there. 11.5.5.2 Incontestability \u00b6 For the first two years of a life insurance contract, the insurance company can re-evaluate its underwriting of the policy \u2013 this is called the contestability period. The discovery of a material mistake in the first two years of the policy by the insurance company can lead the company to: Void the policy; Adjust premiums; Add an exclusion. Once this contestability period has expired, the policy is said to be incontestable and the insurance company cannot cancel the policy for any reason other than missed premiums, or fraudulent misrepresentation. Fraud voids a policy at any point it is discovered. If a policy has been cancelled, it can be reinstated by paying all outstanding premiums and any interest. There is also a requirement to prove insurability. Once a policy has been reinstated, the two-year contestability period begins again. 11.5.5.3 Grace period \u00b6 The grace period is the 30 or 31-day period after the premium due date. The premium must be paid before the end of the grace period or else the policy lapses (is cancelled). The death benefit (minus the unpaid premium) is paid if death occurs during the grace period. 11.5.5.4 Reinstatement \u00b6 As noted above, reinstatement of a policy may be possible when missed premiums plus interest is paid and evidence of insurability is provided. A reinstated policy is preferable to a new policy because its premiums will be based on the life insured\u2019s age when the policy was first issued. A new policy will be based on the life insured\u2019s attained age at the time the new policy is issued. Example Barry bought a $250,000 20-year renewable term life insurance policy when he was 38 years old, and the policy premiums were $35 per month. When Barry was 50, he missed three monthly payments in a row and the policy lapsed 31 days after the first missed payment. When he discovered his error, Barry considered buying a new life insurance policy. He was shocked to learn that the premiums on the new policy would be $150 per month because the premiums would be based on his current attained age of 50. Fortunately for Barry, he was still in excellent health, and he was able to reinstate his old policy by paying the $105 in missed premiums, plus accrued interest. 11.5.5.5 Right of rescission \u00b6 There is a ten-day period following delivery of the policy in which the policyholder can change his mind, and receive a full refund of the premium he has paid. 11.5.5.6 Expiry \u00b6 All term policies have an expiry date at which point the coverage will cease. 11.5.5.7 Surrender charges \u00b6 A surrender charge may be applied to a UL policy if it is cancelled or a partial withdrawal is taken. The insurance agent to ensure that the client understands the surrender charges that may be applied a partial withdrawal is made or if the policy is cancelled. 11.6 Using illustrations \u00b6 Illustrations often accompany the application so that the insurance company\u2019s underwriters have a clear understanding of the insurance coverage being requested. They show policy benefits and features in a table or similar format. A term policy illustration shows the premium and death benefit for each year of the policy. A permanent policy illustration shows the premium, death benefit, dividends, mortality deductions, investment account values based on minimum and maximum deposits, and cash surrender value for each year of the policy. Policies that are sensitive to investment performance will show at least two scenarios based on different rates of performance. The scenarios are not predictions of performance, just possibilities. The policyholder signs the illustration as evidence that he understands what it shows","title":"Chapter 11 Recommending An Insurance Policy"},{"location":"life/Chapter_11_Recommending_An_Insurance_Policy/#chapter-11-recommending-an-insurance-policy","text":"","title":"Chapter 11: Recommending An Insurance Policy"},{"location":"life/Chapter_11_Recommending_An_Insurance_Policy/#111-evaluate-the-probability-severity-and-duration-of-risks","text":"It will be your job, as the agent, to assess the severity of risk, the probability that it will occur, and its financial impact.","title":"11.1 Evaluate the probability, severity, and duration of risks"},{"location":"life/Chapter_11_Recommending_An_Insurance_Policy/#1111-probability-of-death","text":"The risk of death is based on the following factors: Age; Gender; Health; Lifestyle risks.","title":"11.1.1 Probability of death"},{"location":"life/Chapter_11_Recommending_An_Insurance_Policy/#11111-current-age-and-gender","text":"As discussed in Chapter 1, women live longer than men.

If multiple policies are proposed, each will have the death benefit specific to its policy objective. Case Study It has been determined that Derek needs a total of $760,000 in additional life insurance. This could be broken down as follows: While the taxability on the cottage is estimated to be $78,750 based on its current value, Derek is con-cerned the tax liability could be much higher because he expects the cottage to continue to appreciate in value. As a result, an amount of $200,000 for the permanent insurance policy would be appropriate to cover the cottage tax liability plus the $100,000 hospice donation. Selecting the paid-up additions (PUA) option for any dividend payments would provide further protection against increasing cottage values. Of the other financial needs, two of them will end within the next 10 years ( $132,000 in child support for Jordan and the car loan of $41,000). A $180,000 Term-10 policy should be used to cover these needs. Case Study (cont.) The balance of $380,000 ( $760,000 \u2013 $200,000 \u2013 $180,000) could be covered by either by a Term-20 policy, or a renewable Term-10 policy. A cost analysis should be performed to determine which would be most cost effective in the long run. Term coverage lasting, at least, five years is also needed on Becky\u2019s life, plus $10,000-term coverage on each of the 3 children. Derek also wanted to consider whether he should replace his existing $250,000 Term-10 policy before it is up for renewal in 2 years.","title":"11.5.2 Death benefits"},{"location":"life/Chapter_11_Recommending_An_Insurance_Policy/#1153-premiums","text":"The premium for each policy and rider should be quoted, with the length of the payment period. The monthly and annual cost should be quoted, in addition to the cumulative cost of term recommendations. When premiums are too expensive, the following remedies are available: Reduce coverage; Consider convertible term instead of permanent; Look at underwriting factors that may have caused a higher premium. For example, could the life insured forego travel to Afghanistan? Look at the budget to see if other expenses could be reduced to free up more cash for premiums. Case Study Based on Derek\u2019s current age, health and smoking status, the following monthly rate would apply per $100,000 of coverage: Whole life with PUA, $325 for life; Term-10 renewable to age 85, $33 for first 10 years, $183 at age 57, $435 at age 67, $925 at age 77; Term-20 renewable to age 85, $60 for first 20 years, $540 at age 67. Cost of new insurance needed on Derek For the cottage liability and hospice donation, the $200,000 of whole life insurance will cost $650 per month. Derek has total term insurance needs of $560,000 ( $760,000 \u2013 $100,000 (cottage) \u2013 $100,000 (hospice donation)): $180,000 of coverage for his shorter term needs (i.e., child support and car loans will end within 10 years); $380,000 ( $760,000 \u2013 $200,000 \u2013 $180,000) in longer-term needs (i.e., spousal support, mortgage and Becky\u2019s income shortfall will end in about 20 years). So should Derek use renewable 10-year term (T-10), 20-year term (T-20), or a combination of both to cover these term needs? Performing a cumulative cost analysis can help as shown in the following table. At this point it is necessary to compare $560,000 of T-10 (Option A) or T-20 (Option B) renewable, dropping to $380,000 of coverage upon renewal, when his needs will have dropped. Remember, the premiums upon renewal will have already been set when he buys the policy. The cumulative cost analysis is provided below: Clearly if only one policy is to be used, the T-20 policy (Option B) works out better than the T-10 policy (Option A) in the long run, with a cumulative cost of $67,680 over 20 years, compared to $105,624 for the T-10 policy. However, notice the cumulative costs for each policy after the first 10 years, before the coverage drops to $380,000. At 10 years, the T-10 policy is the clear winner, with a cumulative cost-to-date of $22,176, compared to $40,320 for the T-20 policy. This reversal suggests that a combination of policies may be in Derek\u2019s best interests. At this point a cumulative cost comparison is useful between: Using a T-20 policy for the entire $560,000, dropping to $380,000 after 10 years (Option B as shown in the Table above); and Using a combination of a T-10 policy for the shorter-term needs of $180,000, along with a T-20 policy of $380,000 to cover the longer-term needs (Option C, shown below). The cumulative cost of this combination of policies over 20 years is only $61,850, compared to the $69,120 over 20 years for a single T-20 policy, or savings of about 10%. So given that Derek has 2 very distinct coverage periods (e.g., 10 years and 20 years) and is certain that some of his insurance needs are short term only, then a combination of T-10 and T-20 policies will be more cost effective in the long run. However, if he feels that his insurance needs may remain the same or even increase in the future, he may want to consider covering the entire amount with a single T-20 policy. Note that while spreadsheets help illustrate the point, the cumulative cost comparisons can usually be done very simply using a calculator, as follows: Option A Single $560,000 renewable T-10 policy, dropping to $380,000 after 10 years 1 st 10 years = $560,000 \u00f7 $100,000 \u00d7 $33/month \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 10 years = $22,176 2 nd 10 years = $380,000 \u00f7 $100,000 \u00d7 $183/month \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 10 years = $83,448 Cumulative cost over 20 years = $22,176 + $ 83,448 = $105,624 Case Study (cont.) Option B Single $560,000 T-20 policy, dropping to $380,000 after 10 years 1 st 10 years = $560,000 \u00f7 $100,000 \u00d7 $60/month \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 10 years = $40,320 2 nd 10 years = $380,000 \u00f7 $100,000 \u00d7 $60/month \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 10 years = $27,360 Cumulative cost over 20 years = $40,320 + $27,360 = $67,680 Option C $180,000 T-10 policy for 10 years, plus $380,000 T-20 policy for 20 years T-10 policy = $180,000 \u00f7 $100,000 \u00d7 $33/month \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 10 years $7,128 T-20 policy = $380,000 \u00f7 $100,000 \u00d7 $60/month \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 20 years $54,720 Cumulative cost of 20 years = $7,128 + $54,720 = $61,848 - Replace Derek\u2019s existing $250,000 policy? Derek has an existing $250,000 Term-10 policy that is due to renew in 2 years. He was shocked to realize how much the premiums will increase upon renewal (from $250 per year to $1,125 per year). Derek heard that it is often cheaper to shop for a new policy, rather than renew the old one, so he asked his agent to determine the cost of replacing his old policy. The results are provided in the table below, which shows that Derek would be better off keeping his existing policy. The reason the results were disappointing for Derek was that he became a smoker after the original policy was issued. The old policy will remain valid, even though Derek is now a smoker. This is one of the reasons premiums jump so much upon renewal because the life insured may no longer be in the fine health he was when the policy was first issued. Case Study (cont.) Insurance for Becky and the Children Derek wants to obtain $150,000 of life insurance coverage on Becky\u2019s life, and $10,000 on each of the children. This can be accomplished in one of two ways: Buying a stand-alone $150,000 Term-10 insurance policy on Becky, with a $10,000 child-life rider, which would have a total monthly premium of $23.54; Adding a family life rider to his whole-life insurance policy, with $150,000 of Term-10 coverage on Becky and $10,000 each on the children, which would have a total monthly premium of $19.04. The stand-alone policy is more expensive because it has a separate policy administration fee; this fee is not charged when the coverage is added as a rider to Derek\u2019s whole life policy. Total costs The total monthly cost of the recommended additional insurance is $956, as shown below This exceeds the $440 the family currently has in available cash flow, so they will have some decisions to make. A few of the possibilities include: - Reducing the amount of coverage, and accepting the fact that Becky may have to return to work before Robbie turns 18, and Derek will not be able to leave $100,000 to his favourite charity; - Obtaining term insurance with a conversion option for the tax liability on the cottage and the hospice donation, which would allow Derek to convert to permanent insurance once cash flow permits; - Scaling back on their other expenditures to increase the amount of cash flow they can devote to life insurance; - Depending on the policy of their insurance company, Derek may be able to apply for a decrease in premiums if he is able to stop smoking for at least a year.","title":"11.5.3 Premiums"},{"location":"life/Chapter_11_Recommending_An_Insurance_Policy/#1154-beneficiaries","text":"Based on understanding the client\u2019s situation, the agent may be able to recommend how the beneficiary designations should be structured\u2014for example, revocable or irrevocable.","title":"11.5.4 Beneficiaries"},{"location":"life/Chapter_11_Recommending_An_Insurance_Policy/#11541-primary-and-contingent","text":"A primary beneficiary receives the death benefit so long as they survive the life insured.

Beneficiaries can include: The estate of the policyholder, when the purpose is to pay the tax liabilities on the estate; The surviving spouse, if the funds are used to replace a source of income; Any person the policyholder chooses to name; A trustee for minor children, if the funds are to be used to support a minor child. Case Study With his $180,000-term life insurance policy, Derek could name Becky the beneficiary of $50,000 in order to reimburse his car loan and a testamentary trust as the beneficiary of $130,000, to provide child support for Jordan, with any remaining amount to be paid to Becky when Jordan turns 18. The agent should also encourage the applicant to specify one or more contingent beneficiaries. If the primary beneficiary does not survive the life insured, then the death benefit will pass to the contingent beneficiary. If no contingent beneficiary is named, then the death benefit will be paid to the policyholder, or if the policyholder is also the life insured, to his estate.

Thus, the life insurance agent will need to provide ongoing service for clients. Some life events that may impact insurance needs are: New dependants; Marriage; Divorce; Employment changes; New mortgage; Acquiring a business; Leaving Canada; and Update needs analysis and appropriate recommendations. 12.1.1 New dependants \u00b6 An addition to the family, such as a new baby, usually increases the requirement for insurance coverage. The life insured will want to ensure that their estate will be able to provide for that dependant in the event of his or her death. There is another person to consider in the estate-planning process. A parent may wish to insure the new family member by either buying a new policy or by adding a family rider to an existing policy. A baby is automatically covered under existing policies that have a family rider 15 days after birth. 12.1.2 Marriage \u00b6 Marriage may call for the following insurance-related changes: Obtaining a new policy on the life of a new spouse; Changing the beneficiary designation in an existing policy to the new spouse; An increase in the death benefit of an existing policy to ensure that enough financial support can continue in the event of the life insured\u2019s death. Ongoing Service 12.1.3 Divorce \u00b6 Note that divorce automatically revokes an ex-spouse\u2019s entitlement under an existing will. It does not automatically revoke beneficiary designations. Except in Qu\u00e9bec where a pre-divorce beneficiary designation on a life insurance policy is nullified upon divorce. In all other jurisdictions, divorce may call for the former spouse to be changed as beneficiary. If spousal support is required as part of a settlement agreement, often the agreement will specify that a spouse obtain a life insurance policy to ensure that the support obligation continue to be satisfied in the event of that spouse\u2019s death. To protect the recipient spouse or child, additional conditions may be imposed as part of the agreement such as the spouse cannot allow the policy to lapse or that the beneficiary designation must be irrevocable. 12.1.4 Employment changes \u00b6 Whenever there is a change in employment, insurance needs should be reviewed. A change of employer suggests: A comparison of the previous group coverage with the new group coverage to identify whether there are any declines or gaps in coverage; An opportunity to convert group coverage to an individual policy, usually within 30 days of leaving the group plan. A change in income suggests: A review of the amount of insurance coverage that is in place when the insurance needs have been determined based on the human capital approach. A change in job function suggests: The possibility for an improvement in premium rating. 12.1.5 New mortgage \u00b6 A lender may require insurance on a mortgage as a condition of the mortgage. Families may opt to buy a personally held insurance policy with enough coverage to pay off the mortgage to the lender in the event of the death of an income-earning spouse. 12.1.6 Acquiring a business \u00b6 A person who starts a new business, buys a business, or buys into a business or partnership will want to buy life insurance to: Ensure appropriate coverage is in place for a buy-sell agreement or for a key employee; Protect wealth from creditors; or Use as collateral, if needed, to secure a business loan. 12.1.7 Leaving Canada \u00b6 A policy review is essential if there will be a relocation or move abroad that will cause the individual to cease from being a Canadian resident - some policies are only valid if the life insured is resident in Canada. Also, some policies may include an exclusion if death occurs outside of Canada. 12.1.8 Updated needs analysis and recommendations \u00b6 Whenever there is a change in the circumstances of the policyholder or the life insured, the agent should review the previous needs\u2019 analysis. It should be revised to reflect all changes in the policyholder\u2019s situation. In other words, the needs\u2019 analysis must be based on current needs, not outdated needs. Changes that may need to be addressed include: Replacing a policy; Converting a policy from term to permanent; Revising a policy to include riders, modify coverage or lives insured; Changing the beneficiary designations. 12.2 Amending a policy \u00b6 There are two categories of changes that could be made to an existing life insurance policy: Those that require underwriting; and Those for which underwriting is not required. 12.2.1 Administrative changes \u00b6 Administrative changes do not change the underwriting on the policy. A policyholder can make changes by contacting the insurance company. Such changes include: Changes in name of the policyholder and beneficiaries (due to marriage or divorce); Mailing address change; Beneficiary designation changes; Change to frequency of premiums; Changes to investment fund choices. 12.2.2 Changes requiring underwriting \u00b6 Underwriting must be involved for the following types of changes: Adding a life insured; Adding riders and/or supplementary benefits; Increases to the coverage; Changed to the type of death benefit; Changes in risk factors such as health or lifestyle categories; Changes to the dividend option on a par policy or to paid-up additions. 12.3 Renewing a policy \u00b6 A renewable term policy will: Renew at the end of its term automatically; Does not require evidence of insurability; Provide a schedule of guaranteed renewal rates when the policy is issued; and Increase premiums to reflect the age of the life insured on the renewal date. Example Kevin bought a $500,000 10-year renewable term insurance policy when he was 35 years old, and the initial premiums were $450 per year. The policy will automatically renew at age 45, 55, and 65, with annual premiums of $2,250, $5,250 and $13,700 respectively. Renewable policies are more subject to adverse selection than other types of policies. This leads to the guaranteed renewal rates being higher than if the policyholder were to obtain a new policy. Adverse selection is when those who would not qualify for a new policy are more likely to renew the policy than those in good health. 12.4 Replacing a policy \u00b6 Life insurance agents face a potential conflict of interest due to the commission they earn when a new policy replaces an existing policy. Life insurance agents have a fiduciary duty to the client that requires the recommendation of a policy replacement to be in the best interests of the policyholder. 12.4.1 Churning and twisting \u00b6 An agent must not misrepresent, provide incomplete information, or make incorrect statements to a policyholder to convince him to: Replace one policy with another; or Use the cash value from one policy to buy another. Doing any of the above is a breach of the life insurance agent\u2019s fiduciary duty. The following two deceitful practices are prohibited by life insurance agents: Churning occurs when a policyholder is persuaded to replace one policy with another at the same insurance company; Twisting occurs when one policy is replaced with another at a different insurance company. 12.4.2 Disclosure requirements \u00b6 In most jurisdictions, a policy replacement requires the policyholder to sign a Life Insurance Replacement Declaration (LIRD) form. The LIRD ask questions about the existing policy as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the new policy. The LIRD must be accompanied by a written explanation about the reasons for the policy replacement, the benefits the policyholder will receive from the new policy and a description of any situation when benefits might not be paid under the new policy. In Qu\u00e9bec, the Notice of Replacement of Insurance of Persons Contract is used instead of the LIRD. Standard Life Insurance Replacement Declaration (LIRD) Source: Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators. Life Insurance Replacement Declaration. [online]. Revised 2008. [Consulted May 21, 2019]. http://www.ccir-ccrra.org/en/for Note Life Insurance Replacement Declaration Do not cancel your existing policy until the new policy is in force and you accept it. Before you cancel your life insurance policy, you should have answers to the questions below. Ask any insurance agent or broker, or an independent person, for help if you need it. Questions about your present life insurance policy Why do you want to replace your policy? Is the new policy better for you? How? Should you just buy more insurance or change your policy? How much will these changes cost? When should you cancel your present policy? When is your next annual dividend paid? Will the timing affect your cancellation charges? Will you pay more income tax if you cancel your present policy? Questions on the advantages and disadvantages of a new life insurance policy Do you understand the type of insurance policy you are buying? Is it a term life, whole life, or universal life insurance policy? You should know the differences. Are there times when the new policy will not pay all the benefits that your present policy does? Examples are suicide and contestable periods and contractual exclusions. Will the new policy pay as much as your present policy? Examples are death benefits, cash values, and dividends. Does the new policy have the same extra, or optional, benefits as your present policy? Examples are waiver of premium, guaranteed insurability, accidental death, and family member riders. Are there cancellation charges on the new policy? What guarantees apply to your present and proposed policies? Which policy has the best guarantees? Will either of the policy premiums (payments) go up? For how long will the premiums stay the same? How much will they increase? Important: Please ensure that the agent or broker provides you with copies of the written explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of replacing your life insurance policy with a new policy. I confirm that I have received this Life Insurance Replacement Declaration. Client\u2019s signature Date I have given the client this document and a written explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of replacing their life insurance policy, before starting the application for a new policy. Agent or broker\u2019s signature Date Note : Your agent or broker should deliver and review the new policy with you. If the policy is not satisfactory for any reason, you may have a right to reject it and receive a full refund of premiums, under provincial or territorial law or under contract. Check the policy and the law for the right of rejection and the time limit for rejection. 12.4.3 Cancelling the contract being replaced \u00b6 The new policy must be issued, delivered and accepted before the old policy is cancelled. Otherwise, a gap in coverage could occur. If the old policy is cancelled too soon and temporarily leaves the life insured with no insurance coverage, if the life insured were to die during the period of no coverage, there is no death benefit to be paid. 12.5 Cancelling a policy \u00b6 The policyholder may cancel a policy whenever he chooses and for whatever reason, such as: He no longer needs the protection; He needs a different type of policy; He could obtain a better rate with a new policy compared to renewing the existing policy; He can no longer afford the premiums. Not paying premiums will cancel a term policy immediately. A whole life or universal life policy with cash value may not be immediately cancelled if the cash value is used for to make the premium payments. It is better for a policyholder to cancel the policy in writing by providing all pertinent details such as the policy number to ensure the cancellation occurs as desired. A prorated portion of premiums paid may be refunded at the time of cancellation. 12.6 Surrendering a policy \u00b6 A policyholder\u2019s cancellation of a whole life policy or a universal life policy is commonly referred to as fully surrendering the policy. Upon surrender, a policyholder gives up all rights, including the death benefit, under the contract. Withdrawals from a policy\u2019s cash surrender value is considered a partial surrender of the policy. With partial surrenders, the policy remains in effect and a death benefit will be paid if the life insured dies after the withdrawal. However, a partial surrender may result in a policy taxable gain upon which the policyholder would be taxed. 12.7 Policy assignments \u00b6 A policyholder can choose to assign some or all of his rights under an insurance policy to another party. 12.7.1 Absolute policy assignment \u00b6 An absolute policy assignment transfers legal title and all rights and obligations of the policy from the policyholder to the assignee or recipient, relinquishing all further control or financial interest in the policy. The policy typically specifies the requirements for completing an absolute assignment. An absolute assignment is considered a deemed disposition which could lead to taxable income for the policyholder. 12.7.2 Partial policy assignment \u00b6 In all of Canada, except Qu\u00e9bec, the use of a life insurance policy to secure a loan requires the policyholder to execute a collateral assignment. This takes the form of a partial assignment; where the policyholder continues to own the policy but is restricted from any actions that could reduce the value of the policy, such as making a withdrawal. When the life insured dies, if the loan is still outstanding, the lender has first rights on the death benefit, up to the amount of the loan outstanding. In Qu\u00e9bec, a movable hypothec is required to use a life insurance policy to secure a loan. It does not involve the transfer of policy ownership but gives the lender rights in the policy to the extent of the loan balance. It can only be used by businesses; the loan must be for business purposes. 12.8 Claims process \u00b6 When the life insured dies, the beneficiary or the estate (if no beneficiary is named) becomes the claimant and comes forward to receive the death benefit. 12.8.1 Agent\u2019s role \u00b6 The life agent\u2019s role is to assist with the claims process in a timely and sensitive manner. This may include providing and filling out forms as well as choosing settlement options. It is important that the agent not give the claimant the impression that the agent is the one who decides whether the claim will be paid, or that payment is guaranteed. 12.8.2 Completed claim form \u00b6 The agent may provide the claim forms and help the claimant complete the forms. The completed forms and additional required documentation are sent to the claims examiner at the insurance company. 12.8.3 Policy status \u00b6 One of the first things the claims examiner must do is verify that the policy was in force when death occurred. The policy may not be in force and hence and the death benefit will not be paid if the policy: Lapsed; Was surrendered; or Expired (in the case of a term policy). 12.8.4 Proof of death \u00b6 Proof of death must accompany the claims forms and is used to ensure that the deceased was the life insured under the policy. Proof of death is usually provided in the form of one or more of: A death certificate; A funeral director\u2019s certificate; or A coroner\u2019s report. 12.8.5 Letters probate \u00b6 The claims examiner may request a copy of the life insured\u2019s probated will if the estate is named as the beneficiary of the policy. A probate will also be requested if the named beneficiary is deceased. As part of the probate process, a \u201cletters probate\u201d is issued by a court which verifies that the will of a deceased is valid and that the executor has the authority to administer (act on behalf of) the estate. If the life insured dies without a will, the court appoints an administrator and issues \u201cletters of administration\u201d which confirm the administrator authority. Probate fees are a charge against the estate when letters probate and letters of administration are issued by the court. In Qu\u00e9bec, the claims adjuster will request a copy of the notarial will and the will search certificate which establishes that the will received is the last will and testament of the deceased. If the will is handwritten or made in the presence of witnesses, it must be probated by a notary or by the Superior Court of Qu\u00e9bec, who, upon completion of the probate process delivers a certified copy of the will. If the insured dies intestate, the legal heirs are the liquidators of the succession. The claims adjuster will request a notarial declaration of heirship and/or the appointment of liquidators, which must be obtained from the court or a notary. The costs of obtaining these documents are the responsibility of the succession. 12.8.6 Attending physician\u2019s statement (APS) \u00b6 Usually, in the case of large claims, an attending physician\u2019s statement (APS) will be requested to confirm the cause of death and verify the medical information used that was used to underwrite and issue the policy. If the cause of death is suicide and the suicide occurred within the two-year suicide exclusion period, the claim will be denied and the death benefit will not be paid. If death was the result of an activity or cause listed in the policy as an exclusion, the claim will be denied and the death benefit will not be paid. 12.8.7 Proof of age and gender \u00b6 A birth certificate may be requested to prove age and gender. A discrepancy in age from what was reported on the application may result in an adjustment of the death benefit. 12.8.8 Confirmation of beneficiary \u00b6 The claims examiner will need to confirm that the claimant is the beneficiary named in the policy, as on record at the insurance company, or as directed in the will of the policyholder. If a named beneficiary has died before the claim is made for the life insured, the claim examiner will require proof of death before the death benefit is paid to the contingent beneficiary (or estate if no contingent beneficiary has been named). When a class of people is named as beneficiary, the insurance company will ensure that all members of the class have been identified before the death benefit is paid out. For example, naming \u201call my grandchildren,\u201d will require all grandchildren to be identified to ensure they are that they are all alive and all included in the distribution. 12.9 Group life insurance claims \u00b6 Group life insurance claims are processed in much the same way; only the plan\u2019s administrator, rather than a life agent, will facilitate the claims process. In the case of an employer-sponsored group plan, the claims examiner will confirm that the deceased person was in fact covered under the plan. He may not be covered if he had yet not satisfied the plan\u2019s waiting period, or if he had terminated employment prior to death. Group creditor insurance may be subject to post-claim underwriting. 12.10 Factors that could vary the payment upon death \u00b6 It is possible for the amount paid out to the beneficiaries upon death could be more or less than the policy\u2019s face amount due to a number of reasons: 12.10.1 Participating whole life policies \u00b6 Depending on the payment option selected when the policy was set up, participating policy dividends can affect the death benefit: Paid up additions will permanently increase the death benefit every time a policy dividend is issued; The accumulation option will increase the death benefit, provided funds are not withdrawn; The term option will temporarily increase the death benefit for the duration of the one-year term. 12.10.2 Adjustable whole life policies \u00b6 With an adjustable whole life policy, the death benefit and premiums are guaranteed for a specified period. After the guarantee period ends the death benefit may be increased, decreased, or stay the same depending on the insurance company\u2019s experience. 12.10.3 Universal life policies \u00b6 Universal Life policies have several death benefit options, including a: Level death benefit; Death benefit plus account value; Death benefit plus cumulative premiums; Indexed death benefit. The death benefit can be larger than the face amount depending on the form of death benefit selected by the policyholder, deposits, and investment returns. 12.10.4 Misstatement of age \u00b6 At the time of the claim, if the insurance company discovers that the insured\u2019s age was fraudulently misstated on the application, the policy will be voided and the claim will be denied. The onus is on the insurance company to prove that the misstatement was fraudulent. However, if the misstatement of age was a mistake, the death benefit will be paid but will be adjusted the appropriate coverage that, based on premiums paid, would have been purchased. In Qu\u00e9bec, a policy is not voided by misstatement of age. The death benefit is adjusted. Example When Paul was 45 years old, he bought a $100,000 10-year term life insurance policy, with an annual premium of $230. Paul died four years later, at age 49. When processing his death claim, the insurance company noticed that there was a mistake on Paul\u2019s application, which had led them to believe he was only 40 years old at the time of issue. However, the annual premium for someone aged 45 at the time of issue was $324. Ignoring any annual policy fees included in the premium, this means that the insurance company would pay a death benefit of $70,988, calculated as: New death benefit = (Annual premium paid \u00f7 Premium due based on issue age) \u00d7 Original death benefit $70,988 = ( $230 \u00f7 $324) \u00d7 $100,000 This is the amount of coverage that Paul\u2019s premiums of $230 would have purchased if the insurance company had known he was 45. 12.10.5 Misstatement of gender \u00b6 Like misstatement of age, a policy will be voided if it is discovered at the time of the claim that the insured\u2019s gender was fraudulently misstated. The onus is on the insurance company to prove that the misstatement was fraudulent. If the misstatement was not fraudulent, the death benefit will be adjusted to what would have been paid based on premiums paid. Example When Leslie was 35 years old, he bought a $100,000 10-year term life insurance policy with an annual premium of $62. When he died three years later, the insurance company discovered that his gender had been entered as female when the policy was issued, so the annual premium he was paying of $62 was lower than it should have been. Premiums for a 35-year-old male would have been $80. Ignoring any annual policy fees included in the premium, this means that the insurance company would pay a death benefit of $77,500, calculated as: - ( $62 \u00f7 $80) \u00d7 $100,000 = $77,500 This is the amount of coverage that Leslie\u2019s premiums of $62 would have purchased if the insurance company had known at the time of issuing the policy that he was male. 12.10.6 Policy assigned as collateral \u00b6 When a collateral assignment has been made and the life insured dies, the insurance company will pay the outstanding balance on the loan from the death benefit to the lender and pay the remaining balance to the beneficiary. 12.10.7 Outstanding policy loan \u00b6 When a policy loan has been taken from the cash surrender value of a policy and the balance is still outstanding at the time of the insured\u2019s death, the death benefit is reduced by the outstanding amount of loan plus accrued interest. Example Marva has a $500,000 whole life insurance policy, and three years ago she took a policy loan of $100,000 against the policy\u2019s cash surrender value, with interest at 4.5% compounded annually. She has not paid back the loan or paid any interest over the past three years. If she dies today, the death benefit will be reduced by $114,117, calculated as: $114,117 = $100,000 \u00d7 1.045 (Year 1) \u00d7 1.045 (Year 2) \u00d7 1.045 (Year 3) This is the original policy loan plus compound interest calculated as: Year 1: ( $100,000 + (4.5% \u00d7 $100,000) = $104,500); Year 2: ( $104,500 + (4.5% \u00d7 $104,500) = $109,202.50); Year 3: ( $109,202.50 + (4.5% \u00d7 $109,202.50) = $114,116.61). As a result, her beneficiary would receive $385,883 calculated as: $500,000 - $114,117 = $385,883 12.10.8 Unpaid premiums \u00b6 When a premium has been missed and the life insured dies during the grace period, the death benefit is reduced by the amount of the unpaid premium. Example Joshua had a $250,000 term life insurance policy, with annual premiums of $3,300. He has been hospitalized for the last two weeks after suffering a serious heart attack, and as a result, he forgot to pay the premium when it came due last week. If Joshua dies today, the insurance company will still pay the death benefit, but the amount will be reduced to $246,700, calculated as: $246,700 = $250,000 \u2013 $3,300. 12.11 Settlement options \u00b6 The lump-sum payment is one settlement option. However, there are others such as a term certain or life annuity which pays a fixed amount of income for a specified period of time or for life, depending on the type of annuity. Annuities are discussed in more detail in the Segregated Funds and Annuities module. The agent can provide these options when the claim is made. 12.12 Time requirements \u00b6 A claim can be made any time after death. As long as the policy was valid at the time of the life insured\u2019s death, the death benefit will be paid plus interest. The life insurance company could pay the death benefit within a couple days or several months. IN cases of an investigation, the claim must be paid within 30 days of submission of supporting documents and the investigation conclusion. 12.13 Tax treatment of death benefits \u00b6 The death benefit of personally held life insurance is received tax-free by the beneficiary and does not create taxable income for the deceased. The death benefit includes the entire amount. The death benefit of a group life insurance policy is received tax-free by the beneficiary and does not create taxable income for the deceased, regardless of whether the employee or the employer paid the premiums. When life insurance is owned by a corporation, the death benefit is received tax-free by the corporation and some or all of the benefit is credited to its capital dividend account. The corporation, as instructed by the Board of Directors, pays out a tax-free dividend from the capital dividend account to shareholders.","title":"Chapter 12 Ongoing Service"},{"location":"life/Chapter_12_.Ongoing_Service/#chapter-12-ongoing-service","text":"","title":"Chapter 12: .Ongoing Service"},{"location":"life/Chapter_12_.Ongoing_Service/#121-monitoring-changing-client-needs","text":"The need for insurance may change over time if personal circumstances change.

Before you cancel your life insurance policy, you should have answers to the questions below. Ask any insurance agent or broker, or an independent person, for help if you need it. Questions about your present life insurance policy Why do you want to replace your policy? Is the new policy better for you? How? Should you just buy more insurance or change your policy? How much will these changes cost? When should you cancel your present policy? When is your next annual dividend paid? Will the timing affect your cancellation charges? Will you pay more income tax if you cancel your present policy? Questions on the advantages and disadvantages of a new life insurance policy Do you understand the type of insurance policy you are buying? Is it a term life, whole life, or universal life insurance policy? You should know the differences. Are there times when the new policy will not pay all the benefits that your present policy does? Examples are suicide and contestable periods and contractual exclusions. Will the new policy pay as much as your present policy? Examples are death benefits, cash values, and dividends. Does the new policy have the same extra, or optional, benefits as your present policy? Examples are waiver of premium, guaranteed insurability, accidental death, and family member riders. Are there cancellation charges on the new policy? What guarantees apply to your present and proposed policies? Which policy has the best guarantees? Will either of the policy premiums (payments) go up? For how long will the premiums stay the same? How much will they increase?

Life insurance agents need to help their clients understand the reality of this risk and the need to address it. The probability that an individual will die at a specific age is called the mortality rate. Many factors influence the risk of an individual dying. They include: The person\u2019s age (those who are younger are less likely to die); The person\u2019s gender (men do not live as long as women); Personal and family health history (i.e., tendencies towards death at a younger than \u201cnormal\u201d age, or for longevity [a long lifespan], or for poor health that might cause premature death); Smoking habits (smokers typically die younger than non-smokers); Job and income level (high earners enjoy longer lives). Life insurance companies, in assessing the risk of death when a person applies for life insurance, collects these factors into a profile. The insurance company then assigns the individual to a group that consists of people with similar profiles. Each group has its own mortality data (life expectancy and probability of death statistics presented in what is called a life table) that is used to predict the risk of death. The risk of death is based on: Life expectancy: This is the average number of years a person within a certain group and of a certain age can expect to live; It takes into account the past mortality experience of the group to which that person belongs; In Canada, at birth males have a life expectancy of 79.8 years and females 84.2 Probability of death: This is the likelihood of a person within a certain group and of a certain age dying in a year expressed as a percentage; It assumes that the past mortality experience of the group to which that person belongs will hold true in the future; At age 30, a male has a little over 1% chance of death that year; The probability of death increases with age. At age 85, a male has more than an 8% chance of dying that year. Introduction to Life Insurance Module Life expectancy and probability of death statistics are compiled for each unique and defined group of people and are often presented in a format called a \u201clife table\u201d (or a \u201cmortality table\u201d). An extract from a Statistics Canada Life table is provided in Table 1.11. Probability of death: Before age 40\u2014is low and slowly increases until around age 40 (with the exception of the first few years of life); and After age 40\u2014begins to increase more and more each year due to age-related health problems. An agent should educate the client on life expectancy as well as probability of death and the need to mitigate the risk. Probability of death is used by an agent when doing an insurance needs analysis. Life expectancy is a factor when developing a retirement savings plan or retirement income plan. 1.2 Potential Financial Impact of Death \u00b6 Agents should address the financial consequences of death when they assess the client\u2019s needs and explore the risk of death with a client. Life insurance policies pay a sum of money called a \u201cdeath benefit\u201d when the person who is insured dies. The death benefit helps families manage the financial consequences resulting from the death of an immediate family member. Chapter 10 takes a deeper look at the financial impacts of death when an agent completes a life insurance needs analysis for a client \u00b9 Statistics Canada. Life expectancy and other elements of the life table, Canada, all provinces except Prince Edward Island, (Table 13-10-0114-01, 2014 to 2016). [online]. Revised May 31, 2019. [Consulted May 31, 2019]. https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310011401 The following are examples of the financial impacts of death: Loss of Income: For instance, if a young father who is the primary income-earner dies the death benefit is available to his family. Loss of Caregiver: For instance, if a mother who looks after children at home dies. Debt Repayment: It is the executor of the estate\u2019s responsibility to pay off any outstanding debts upon death; Creditors may demand immediate repayment of a loan or, in some cases, may be willing to extend the loan to the surviving spouse/beneficiary who inherits the property if that person has the income needed to make loan payments. Income Taxes: Upon death, an individual is deemed to have disposed of all his property at fair market values. Unless rollover or tax exemption provisions apply, taxes are assessed and any capital gains must be paid. The executor may have to sell assets if the estate does not have sufficient funds to pay the resulting income tax; An individual\u2019s registered assets will also be deregistered (unless a rollover applies) upon death. Thus, the full amount will be taxed at his marginal tax rate at death. Estate Creation: Education funding (providing funds for university/college education), establishing legacies (providing a financial gift to some special upon death) and charitable giving are common estate objectives. Business Impact: The death of a business partner may force the sale of the business. As well, significant revenue could be lost due to the death of a key employee. The revenue loss could be so severe that it puts into question the continuity of the business. Example Justin and Tanya are both 30 years old and they have three children aged 1, 3 and 4 years old. Tanya currently stays at home with the children so Justin is the sole income earner. How would this young family cope financially if Justin died? The loss of Justin\u2019s income would be devastating. Now consider what would happen if Tanya was the one who died. As the sole income earner, Justin would not be able to afford to stop working to care for the children. Unless another person could step in and assume the role of a caregiver to the children free of charge (such as one of Justin\u2019s or Tanya\u2019s parents), Justin would have to hire someone to assume this role. If Justin dies, the bank is unlikely to extend the mortgage to Tanya because she is not working. She would have to sell the family home to pay off the debt. Death benefit proceeds from life insurance can be used to help: Minimize the financial impact of death on the surviving family; Provide the money to pay for a substitute caregiver; Repay debts that might otherwise have to be taken from the value of the estate of the deceased; Pay the tax liabilities owing on the estate; Create an estate that includes money to be used to: Pay future education costs of the deceased\u2019s children; Create a legacy, i.e., by paying an inheritance; and Give to charity. Protect business assets by funding a partnership agreement. Example Allen owned a thriving boutique restaurant called Vertical. Some of its success was due to its amazing location, quirky interior decorating and personable staff, but the real draw was Vertical\u2019s chef, Luigi. Customers raved over Luigi\u2019s signature dishes and his tableside manner; he always visited each table personally to say hello and to make sure each meal was to the customer\u2019s satisfaction. When Luigi died suddenly, the restaurant\u2019s revenue dropped dramatically. It took Allen almost six months to find a chef of the same calibre, and then Allen had to launch an expensive marketing campaign to lure customers back to the restaurant. The financial strain during this time came very close to bankrupting Allen. 1.3 Risk Management Strategies \u00b6 Risk management is the choice or choices a person makes in regard to the risks he faces. Different risks can be managed in different ways. Four ways to manage risk include: Risk avoidance: In this strategy, an individual would avoid the situation or circumstance that exposes them to risk. For example, not smoking avoids the risks associated with smoking. Risk reduction: This strategy is used when risk cannot be entirely avoided; Risk reduction lessens the risk you are exposed to. Wearing a seatbelt reduces your risk of personal injury in a car accident. Risk retention: In this strategy the individual accepts some or all of the risk. A person without life insurance retains all of the financial risk of premature death. Waiting periods or deductibles are examples of accepting some of the risk. Risk transfer: When some or all of the risk is transferred\u2014that is, moved from one to another. Life insurance transfers financial risk from the individual to the insurer in exchange for premium payments. Example James and Mary are married. They are both concerned about having a car accident and the possibility of dying as a result. James adopts a risk avoidance strategy by choosing to take public transit instead of driving to work. Mary understands the risk of driving; by deciding to keep driving to work, she adopts a risk retention strategy. She also adopts risk reduction strategies by choosing a car with a high safety rating, and wearing her seatbelt and obeying all traffic rules when driving. Mary is aware of the financial impacts that could result from a car accident, so she purchased automobile insurance and life insurance. This is a risk transfer strategy because if she does have a car accident, the insurance company assumes the financial liability.","title":"Chapter 1 Introduction to Life Insurance Module"},{"location":"life/Chapter_1_Introduction_to_Life_Insurance_Module/#chapter-1-introduction-to-life-insurance-module","text":"","title":"Chapter 1: Introduction to Life Insurance Module"},{"location":"life/Chapter_1_Introduction_to_Life_Insurance_Module/#11-risk-of-death","text":"Death is a risk to which everyone is exposed.

The two words, contract and policy, mean the same thing and are used interchangeably in this course. Term life insurance is a contract that promises to pay a death benefit upon the death of the life insurance over a set period of time or to a specific age (i.e., 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years or to age 65). Term insurance is typically used to cover or protect a specific need. For instance, a 25-year mortgage could be covered with a 25-year term policy. If the person insured by the policy dies during the term of the contract, the death benefit (i.e., the life insurance coverage) is paid to the beneficiary of the policy. If the person does not die during the term, the insurance policy expires and there is no refund of premium. 2.1.1 Typical Terms \u00b6 Term insurance can be issued for 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 30 years or to a specific age (e.g., 60 years)\u2014 term length depends on the insurance company. Longer terms have higher premiums because the risk of death will increase over the term. 2.1.2 Age Limits \u00b6 Term insurance can be issued to a specified age\u2014such as age 60, 65, 70 or 75\u2014again, it depends on the insurance company. The older the age at which the policy ends, the higher the premiums because the risk of death increases in step with increasing age. Most insurance companies will not issue insurance policies past a specific age (around 75 or 80) due to the high risk of death. 2.2 Policyholder vs. Life/Lives Insured \u00b6 Note that the information in Section 2.2, 2.2.1, and 2.2.2 is true for term and permanent forms of life insurance. The policyholder is the individual who owns the life insurance contract. This person is responsible for making all the decisions for the contract. Some decisions, such as who the beneficiary will be, are made when the contract is taken out. Term Life Insurance Decisions may also be made while the contract is in force, such as changing the beneficiary or deciding to cancel the contract. The life insured is the person whose life is insured by the contract. More specifically, the individual who upon his/her death a death benefit will be paid out to the policy\u2019s beneficiaries. The policyholder may be the same person as the life insured but they can also be two separate people: Joe owns a life insurance policy in which he is the life insured and his wife, Bea, is the beneficiary. If he dies, Bea receives the death benefit; James owns a life insurance policy in which his wife, Lillian, is the life insured and James is the beneficiary. If Lillian dies, James receives the death benefit. The policyholder may also be called the insured. Note that this is different from the life insured. The policyholder is referred to as the insured because he or she has bought protection against the financial loss in the event of the death of the life insured. The life insured in a contract is usually one person. Death of that person triggers payment to the beneficiary. Example Sandra would like to leave a legacy to her adult son, Tristan, when she dies, so she bought a $300,000 10-year term life insurance policy on her own life, with Tristan named as the beneficiary. Sandra is both the policyholder and the life insured. Sandra works for ABC Ltd., and she is very important to the success of the business. ABC Ltd. bought a life insurance policy on Sandra\u2019s life. ABC Ltd. named itself as the beneficiary, and they plan to use the death benefit to help them recruit and train a replacement if Sandra dies. In this case, Sandra is the life insured, but ABC Ltd. is both the policyholder and the beneficiary. 2.2.1 Single Life \u00b6 Most term insurance policies are single life policies, meaning that only one person is insured, and the death benefit will only be paid if that person dies within the term of the policy. 2.2.2 Joint First-to-Die \u00b6 A joint policy is an exception to the single life form of contract. Such a policy insures two or more people. A joint contract usually names two people as the life insureds. When the contract is written as joint first-to-die, the death benefit is paid out to the named beneficiary when the first person dies. The joint first-to-die policy is then terminated. For example, Edward and Helen (married) have a joint first-to-die contract naming the surviving spouse as the beneficiary. If Edward dies, Helen receives the death benefit. If Helen dies, Edward receives the death benefit. Some insurance companies may offer the survivor the opportunity to continue the same level of coverage on his or her own life after life under a new policy. What is the purpose of a joint first-to-die contract? It provides the survivor with capital. That money may be used to pay living expenses, pay debt, buy out a business interest\u2014in short; it can be saved or used any way the survivor chooses. Why pick a joint first-to-die contract? The contract usually has lower premiums than having two separate single life contracts on the two lives insured. Joint first-to-die life insurance is also used to fund business buy-sell agreements, as discussed in Chapter 8 Business life insurance. Combined insurance is a marketing concept and is different from joint life insurance: With a combined life policy, two separate policies are purchased under a single contract. The benefit is a reduced administration fee and a small discount on the premium. Two separate death benefits will be paid out at the time of death of each of the insureds. So when the first person dies the policy will pay out a death benefit and will continue to remain in effect for the surviving person. At the time the second person dies, the death benefit for the second person\u2019s life will be paid out and the policy will terminate. Example Sue and Cindy are common-law partners and they recently bought a house together, with an outstanding mortgage of $250,000. While they can comfortably manage the mortgage payments with their combined incomes, if one of them were to die, the survivor would have a hard time making those mortgage payments. To ensure that the survivor would be able to keep the house, Sue and Cindy took out a $250,000 10-year term joint first-to-die policy, naming the survivor as the beneficiary. If Sue dies, Cindy will receive the death benefit and can pay off the mortgage, and vice-versa. Four years after Sue and Cindy bought their joint first-to-die policy, Sue was killed in a car accident, and Cindy received the $250,000 death benefit. Cindy and Sue adopted a baby two years before Sue\u2019s death, and Cindy wants to make sure the baby is provided for if she dies. For health reasons, Cindy might find it difficult to buy life insurance with reasonable premiums. Luckily, their joint first-to-die policy gives Cindy the option of continuing coverage of $250,000, as long as she exercises the option within 30 days of Sue\u2019s death. 2.2.3 Joint Last-to-Die \u00b6 When the contract is written as last-to-die, the death benefit is paid when the last person dies. Thus, both life insureds must die before the death benefit is paid to a beneficiary. For example, Edward and Helen have a joint last-to-die contract naming their son as the beneficiary. If Edward dies, Helen receives no death benefit; If Helen dies, Edward receives no death benefit; After Edward and Helen die, their beneficiary receives the death benefit. This form of contract is useful for estate planning including creating an inheritance for the beneficiary and paying estate costs, such as income tax. Particularly, when the risk being insured against does not arise until the death of the last person covered by the policy (e.g., the tax liability that can arise upon the death of the second spouse). Because joint last-to-die policies pay the death benefit upon the death of the last survivor whose time of death could extend beyond the length of a term policy, these policies are more commonly used with permanent insurance. Example Hamish and Elizabeth, both aged 55, bought a cottage 20 years ago and it has appreciated significantly in value. They would like the cottage to pass to their children when they die, but they are worried about the income tax liability at death, which their accountant has advised them could be more than $100,000. If Hamish dies first, his share will go to Elizabeth and it will not trigger a capital gain because of the spousal rollover rules. However, when Elizabeth dies after him, a joint last-to-die insurance policy would ensure that the estate has enough money to pay this tax bill. 2.3 Death Benefit \u00b6 All life insurance policies (not just term) pay a tax-free death benefit when the life insured dies. It is paid to the beneficiary. It is also true of all policies that the face amount of the policy is the amount of coverage purchased. However, term insurance may provide a decreasing death benefit (called a decreasing term policy), an increasing death benefit (called an increasing term policy) or a level death benefit (called a level term policy). 2.3.1 Level Term \u00b6 A level term policy has a set death benefit. It is the same as the initial face amount of the policy. This is the most common and straightforward form of term life insurance. Why pick a level term contract? Life insurance needs are not expected to change over the term of the policy; The policy is easy to understand; It is the cheapest form of life insurance. Note, many people who purchase term life insurance often do not take into consideration that their needs might change over the policy term. This means they may be under-insured or over-insured at some point during the term. Example Brad borrowed $100,000 from his father, Steven, to start a new business. Brad promised to pay it off in a lump sum in five years when Steven plans to retire. Knowing that his father needs the money to be able to retire, Brad wants to make sure that he can repay the loan, even if he dies. Brad purchased a 5-year term policy with a level death benefit of $100,000. 2.3.2 Decreasing Term \u00b6 A decreasing term policy has a death benefit that becomes smaller over the life of the policy. The premiums on a decreasing term policy are lower than the premiums on a level term policy of the same face amount. Insurance companies typically offer decreasing term insurance on a group basis. Why pick a decreasing term policy? The policyholder has an obligation, such as a mortgage, that will reduce over a period of time. Example Ranjit and Alisha bought their first home in 2001 with a $200,000 mortgage amortized over 25 years. They bought a joint first-to-die $200,000 25-year decreasing term insurance policy to ensure that if one of them died, the other would be able to pay off the mortgage. 2.3.3 Increasing Term \u00b6 An increasing term policy has a death benefit that grows larger over the length of the policy. The increase may occur every year or on a schedule, such as every five years. The death benefit increase may be a set dollar amount or a percentage of the face amount. The total amount of increase may be limited to a maximum death benefit. The premium increases in proportion to the increase in the death benefit. If the death benefit increases by 10%, so too will the premiums. Why pick an increasing term policy? The policyholder expects an obligation to increase over the length of the policy, for instance, if he/she expects his/her debts or living expenses to increase in the future. The policyholder would pay a lower premium cost for an increasing term policy than by acquiring additional coverage in the future because he/she will be older. A benefit of an increasing term policy is that the death benefit increases even if the health of the insured declines. Thus, it provides the insured with more coverage (protection) in the future at a time when they may not qualify for insurance. In Canada, increasing term insurance is increasingly difficult to find, the same effect may be achieved by adding a rider to the policy. However, increasing term insurance is still offered in the United States. See more on riders in Chapter 5. Example Connor is a business executive who is driven to succeed, and he expects his income to continue to increase at about 10% per year. If he dies, he would like to ensure that his wife receives a lump sum that equals ten times his annual salary. Connor could buy increasing term insurance with an indexing factor of 10%, with an initial face amount equal to 10 times his current salary. 2.4 Term Insurance Premiums \u00b6 All forms of life insurance\u2014not just term\u2014charge a premium to the policyholder. The premium is the cost of the life insurance coverage for the life insured named in the policy. Premiums can be paid monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually by cheque or pre-authorized withdrawal. Generally, term insurance premiums are level over the term (with the exception of increasing term insurance). Provinces charge a premium tax on the premium (2% to 4%) which is included in the premium cost. This premium tax is incorporated into the premiums charged to the policyholder which the insurance company then pays to the provincial government. Premiums are charged a modal factor when they are paid monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually. A modal factor is a charge by the insurance company. See more in Section 4.2.1.2. 2.4.1 How Premiums Are Set \u00b6 The premium is determined by the mortality cost of the life insured, the face amount of the policy ( $10 million as a face amount will have a higher cost than $100,000), and the administrative expenses of the insurance company. Premiums differ between insurance companies for an equivalent face amount: some insurers have higher administrative expenses than others and they differ in their mortality calculations. 2.4.1.1 Mortality Costs \u00b6 Mortality costs approximate the insurance company\u2019s cost of paying out policy death benefits. The insured\u2019s probability of death is dependent on risk factors (i.e., age, gender, and health) determined during the underwriting process. The insurer then classifies the insured into a group of similar people with known mortality experience. Each year, insurance policies estimate their mortality cost by multiplying the face amount of the policy by the probability of death. The estimated mortality cost of the lives insured determines how much premium must be paid. 2.4.1.2 Expenses \u00b6 An insurance company has many administrative expenses to pay from the revenue it earns; premiums are an important source of that revenue. Some of these expenses include sales commissions, marketing, salaries, processing applications, undertaking medical exams, issuing and administering the policy, investigating claims and paying death benefits. Insurance companies invest the premiums they collect. The income earned on the invested premiums is used to offset expenses. 2.5 Renewable vs. Non-Renewable Term Insurance \u00b6 Term life insurance can be either renewable or non-renewable. A non-renewable term policy is one that expires at the end of its term. If the policyholder wants to continue coverage, he/she would have to apply again and prove that he/she is insurable (in good/moderate health). With a renewable term policy, the policyholder\u2019s right to renew is guaranteed regardless of the health of the life insured. The right to renew is usually limited to a certain age (e.g., to age 70). Premiums are higher for renewable terms than for non-renewable terms. Why pick a renewable term contract? There may be doubts about future insurability. For example, a client\u2019s family health history may indicate the likelihood of future problems. Example Henry bought a $200,000 five-year renewable term life insurance policy on his own life when he was 30 years old. Because of his great health at the time, he got the best rates possible. When he turned 35, he renewed the policy and his premiums increased to reflect his age, as specified by his original contract. When he was 38, Henry was diagnosed with cancer. When Henry turned 40, he renewed the policy for another five-year term, and again the premiums increased, but only to recognize his increased age at the time of renewal. His cancer diagnosis did not impact his premiums, and he could not be denied continued coverage. 2.5.1 Renewable Provisions \u00b6 The premiums upon renewal may vary, depending upon the policy provisions. 2.5.1.1 Renewable with Guaranteed Rate \u00b6 While the policyholder of a renewable policy is guaranteed the right to renew the policy at the end of the term, the new premiums will reflect the age of the life insured at renewal. Most policies provide a guaranteed schedule of renewal rates when the policy is first issued. Example Prena purchased a 5-year renewable term life insurance policy when she was 25, with premiums of $155 per year. Her policy offers the following guaranteed rates upon renewal: Prena can rest assured that she can maintain her insurance coverage until age 65, as long as she is willing to pay the increased premiums upon renewal. 2.5.1.2 Re-Entry Term with Adjustable Rates \u00b6 Re-entry term is a form of renewable policy but is subject to two renewal rate schedules: A guaranteed renewal rate; and A lower rate that is adjusted for the good health of the life insured. It guarantees renewal, but bases the renewal premium on the health of the life insured. If the health of the life insured is better than when he first took out the policy, a lower premium is offered; and If the health of the life insured has deteriorated since he first took out the policy, he still has the right to renew the policy, but the guaranteed renewal rates are higher than those for a renewable policy that does not have the re-entry provision. See 2.5.1.1. Because the life insured does not have to provide evidence of insurability with guaranteed renewal policies, the insurance company is taking the risk of continuing to provide insurance coverage to someone whose health may have deteriorated by the time the policy is up for renewal. Because of that additional risk, the initial premiums are higher than a renewable policy with a re-entry provision. Re-entry policies may be a good deal because the life insured retains some of the risk\u2014the risk that his/her health has deteriorated by the time the policy is up for renewal. 2.6 Convertible Term Insurance \u00b6 A convertible term insurance policy can be switched (or, converted) from a term policy to a permanent life insurance policy without evidence of insurability. Thus, the life insured does not have to prove that he or she is in good health for the conversion. The permanent life insurance policy ends with the death of the life insured. Permanent life insurance policies include whole life insurance, Term-100, and universal life insurance. Premiums for convertible term insurance are higher because the policyholder may make the switch and expose the insurance company to additional risk beyond the original term. Conversion times or age are specified in the insurance contract. Why pick a convertible term contract? To have the security of knowing it can be converted to permanent insurance; To be assured of a future death benefit; and When there is any doubt about future insurability. Example Anya has learned that a rare medical condition runs in her family. The condition usually does not develop until after the person reaches 30 years of age. Anya is not afflicted, but her teenage daughter, Jeanette, has a 25% chance of developing the condition. Anya is worried that this may prevent Jeanette from being able to buy life insurance when she is older. She bought a $200,000 renewable and convertible term policy on Jeanette\u2019s life, and she plans to assign (i.e., transfer ownership) of that policy to Jeanette when she is an adult. If Jeanette does develop the condition, she will still be able to convert the policy to a $200,000 whole life policy, giving her access to lifetime insurance protection. 2.6.1 Incontestability and Suicide Provisions \u00b6 The permanent policy issued after conversion is considered an extension of the initial term policy. The policyholder is exempt from a new contestability period and suicide exclusion period. The contestability period is the two years following the issue date of the policy. During this time, the insurance company can void a policy if it discovers a material error was made in the application: A material error is an error that would have affected whether the policy would have been issued; After two years, a policy can be voided by the insurance company only if fraud has been committed by the policyholder. The suicide exclusion period is the two years following the issue date of the original policy. If the life insured commits suicide during these two years, the insurance company can deny the death benefit. Suicide committed after the two-year suicide exclusion period is covered. Note that the contestability period and suicide exclusion period apply to all forms of life insurance, not just convertible policies. 2.6.2 Attained-Age vs. Original-Age Conversions \u00b6 When a policy is converted, the permanent life premium that replaces the term premium may be based on: The attained age of the life insured: The age of the life insured on his last, nearest or next birthday (depending on the administrative policy of the insurance company; The original age of the life insured: The age of the life insured when the policy was first issued. Premiums for the permanent policy are less when the original age of the life insured is used. Example Manuel bought a term life insurance policy on August 12, 2020. His date of birth is November 1, 1986. His premiums will be based on: Aged 33, if attained age is based on his last birthday; Aged 34, if attained age is based on his nearest birthday; Aged 34, if attained age is based on his next birthday. Attained age conversion refers to the attained age of the insured at the time of the conversion to the permanent policy. In the case of an original age conversion (or retroactive conversion), a lump sum payment must be made when the policy is converted that brings the policyholder in line with what his cost would have been had he chosen the permanent policy in the first place. This can be a significant sum. Example Patrick was born on June 1, 1966. His insurance company uses the nearest birthday when determining attained age. He bought a $500,000 5-year renewable and convertible term insurance policy on September 15, 2011, when his attained age was 45. The policy permits conversions at any time up to age 65. Patrick renewed the policy in 2016, and he decided to convert the policy on May 10, 2020. If this is an original-age conversion, his permanent life insurance premiums will be based on age 45. If this is an attained-age conversion, his permanent life insurance premiums will be based on age 54, because his attained age on May 10, 2020, is based on his nearest birthday, which would be June 1, 2020. Original-age conversions result in lower premiums for the permanent life insurance. However, the initial premiums will be higher than premiums for an attained-age convertible term policy due to the risk the insurance company is taking on if the original-age conversion is exercised. 2.7 Advantages and Disadvantages of Term Life Insurance \u00b6 The advantages and disadvantages of term life insurance are summarized below. 2.8 Uses of Term Insurance \u00b6 As a general rule, term insurance should be used to protect against temporary risks\u2014risks that will end before the life insured reaches age 60 or 70. For risks that are expected to last until life expectancy, permanent insurance would be a more appropriate solution. Term insurance would be appropriate for: Short-term risks\u2014risks that are known and expected to be short in duration. If there is a possibility that the risk may extend for a longer but not a permanent period of time, then the policyholder should consider a renewal term policy; Decreasing risks\u2014risks that diminish over time (e.g., mortgage insurance); and Limited cash flow\u2014where the policyholder may not have enough cash to put towards a permanent policy. Some individuals choose term insurance over permanent insurance and use the difference in premiums for investment purposes.","title":"Chapter 2 Term Life Insurance"},{"location":"life/Chapter_2_Term_Life_Insurance/#chapter-2-term-life-insurance","text":"","title":"Chapter 2: Term Life Insurance"},{"location":"life/Chapter_2_Term_Life_Insurance/#21-what-term-means","text":"A life insurance policy is a contract.

Term insurance is typically used to cover or protect a specific need. For instance, a 25-year mortgage could be covered with a 25-year term policy. If the person insured by the policy dies during the term of the contract, the death benefit (i.e., the life insurance coverage) is paid to the beneficiary of the policy.

The policyholder is the individual who owns the life insurance contract. This person is responsible for making all the decisions for the contract. Some decisions, such as who the beneficiary will be, are made when the contract is taken out. Term Life Insurance Decisions may also be made while the contract is in force, such as changing the beneficiary or deciding to cancel the contract. The life insured is the person whose life is insured by the contract. More specifically, the individual who upon his/her death a death benefit will be paid out to the policy\u2019s beneficiaries. The policyholder may be the same person as the life insured but they can also be two separate people: Joe owns a life insurance policy in which he is the life insured and his wife, Bea, is the beneficiary. If he dies, Bea receives the death benefit; James owns a life insurance policy in which his wife, Lillian, is the life insured and James is the beneficiary. If Lillian dies, James receives the death benefit. The policyholder may also be called the insured. Note that this is different from the life insured.

Thus, it provides the insured with more coverage (protection) in the future at a time when they may not qualify for insurance. In Canada, increasing term insurance is increasingly difficult to find, the same effect may be achieved by adding a rider to the policy. However, increasing term insurance is still offered in the United States. See more on riders in Chapter 5. Example Connor is a business executive who is driven to succeed, and he expects his income to continue to increase at about 10% per year. If he dies, he would like to ensure that his wife receives a lump sum that equals ten times his annual salary. Connor could buy increasing term insurance with an indexing factor of 10%, with an initial face amount equal to 10 times his current salary.","title":"2.3.3 Increasing Term"},{"location":"life/Chapter_2_Term_Life_Insurance/#24-term-insurance-premiums","text":"All forms of life insurance\u2014not just term\u2014charge a premium to the policyholder.

With a renewable term policy, the policyholder\u2019s right to renew is guaranteed regardless of the health of the life insured. The right to renew is usually limited to a certain age (e.g., to age 70). Premiums are higher for renewable terms than for non-renewable terms. Why pick a renewable term contract? There may be doubts about future insurability. For example, a client\u2019s family health history may indicate the likelihood of future problems.

See 2.5.1.1. Because the life insured does not have to provide evidence of insurability with guaranteed renewal policies, the insurance company is taking the risk of continuing to provide insurance coverage to someone whose health may have deteriorated by the time the policy is up for renewal.

Permanent life insurance policies include whole life insurance, Term-100, and universal life insurance.

Premiums for the permanent policy are less when the original age of the life insured is used. Example Manuel bought a term life insurance policy on August 12, 2020. His date of birth is November 1, 1986. His premiums will be based on: Aged 33, if attained age is based on his last birthday; Aged 34, if attained age is based on his nearest birthday; Aged 34, if attained age is based on his next birthday. Attained age conversion refers to the attained age of the insured at the time of the conversion to the permanent policy. In the case of an original age conversion (or retroactive conversion), a lump sum payment must be made when the policy is converted that brings the policyholder in line with what his cost would have been had he chosen the permanent policy in the first place. This can be a significant sum. Example Patrick was born on June 1, 1966. His insurance company uses the nearest birthday when determining attained age. He bought a $500,000 5-year renewable and convertible term insurance policy on September 15, 2011, when his attained age was 45. The policy permits conversions at any time up to age 65.

It provides insurance coverage over the lifetime of the life insured and ends upon the death of the life insured. It does not need to be renewed. 3.1.1 How Permanent Insurance Differs From Term Insurance \u00b6 Term insurance is intended to provide protection against risks that are temporary in nature. Term insurance does not provide adequate protection against the risk of death due to: The expiration of the policy after a specified term (i.e., 5, 10, or 20 years); and The fact that most insurance companies will not issue a new term insurance policy to individuals beyond a certain age (i.e., aged 75 or 80). Like level term insurance, premiums for permanent life insurance are the same over the entire life of the policy. In the early years, the premiums for a permanent policy are higher than the premiums for term policies. However, in later years, term insurance becomes prohibitively expensive. 3.1.2 Types of Permanent Insurance \u00b6 There are three types of permanent life insurance: Whole life: Provides coverage for the entire lifetime of the life insured; Premiums remain level; Has a set death benefit; and Builds up a cash surrender value (CSV) over time. When applicable, the policyholder may be entitled to receive payment of that CSV minus any surrender charges if the policyholder surrenders the policy prior to the death of the insured. Term-100 (also called T-100 and Term-to-100): Provides coverage for the entire lifetime of the life insured; Has a set level premium that is lower than whole life; Has a set death benefit; Normally, no cash surrender value; and Policy matures at age 100 (i.e., premium payments stop at age 100, but life insurance coverage continues). Universal life (discussed in Chapter 4): Provides coverage for the lifetime of the life insured; Has two parts to the policy\u2014an insurance component and a saving component; Has a basic premium and an option to deposit more than the basic amount. This is called the excess premium which goes into the savings component; Has a minimum death benefit with an option to increase the death benefit; The savings account offers the policyholder different investment options; and Accumulated savings (and investments) are tax sheltered and form part of the death benefit (tax-deferred if funds are withdrawn prior to death). 3.2 Overview of Whole Life Insurance \u00b6 Whole life insurance is a form of permanent life insurance that typically guarantees the premiums, the death benefit, and minimum cash surrender values (CSV) for the policy. It is sometimes referred to as \u201cstraight life\u201d or \u201cordinary\u201d life insurance. 3.2.1 Coverage Term \u00b6 Whole life is a form of permanent insurance in which the premiums, death benefit and minimum cash surrender values are guaranteed. As long as premiums are paid, coverage is lifelong. The policy does not expire and cannot be cancelled by the life insurance company. 3.2.2 Policy Reserve \u00b6 Recall that the premiums collected by insurance companies are used to cover the risk of death. When the policy is in its early years, the premium charged is higher than the amount needed to cover the risk of death. The excess premium creates a policy reserve. The policy reserve is invested by the insurance company. In later years, where the mortality cost (risk of death) is high, the premiums collected do not adequately cover the risk of death. The investment growth from the policy reserve is used to offset the shortfall. 3.2.3 How Premiums Are Set \u00b6 The premiums for life insurance are calculated based on assumptions about mortality costs, expenses and investment returns. These assumptions are projected over the life of the insurance contracts\u2014which could be as long as 50 or 60 years. Thus, insurance companies take a very conservative approach in their assumptions and estimates. 3.2.3.1 Mortality Costs \u00b6 Mortality costs approximate the insurance company\u2019s cost of paying out policy death benefits. Annual estimated mortality cost = policy\u2019s face amount \u00d7 probability of death of the life insured (during the year). With term insurance, the policy could expire before the death of the life insured. There is a chance that the insurance company will not have to pay the death benefit. With a whole life policy, the insurance company will eventually have to pay the death benefit. In calculating premiums for a whole life policy, the insurance company spreads the cumulative annual mortality costs over the anticipated life of the insurance contract. 3.2.3.2 Expenses \u00b6 The premiums of a whole life policy cover the insurance company\u2019s administrative expenses which include: Marketing expenses; Salaries and commission to agents; Processing the applications; Paying for medical exams; Paying income taxes; Investigating claims; Paying death benefits. With a whole life policy, the insurance company must estimate the future costs of these expenses. 3.2.3.3 Investment Returns \u00b6 Recall that mortality costs are lower at the beginning of life insurance policies and higher towards the end. Insurance companies invest the policy reserve to achieve positive investment returns which can then be used to offset the higher mortality costs later in the life of the insurance contract. The life insurance company must make assumptions about the returns it will make on those investments over the duration of the life insurance contract when calculating the premiums for a whole life insurance contract. Stock market history has shown time and time again that investment returns in reality can differ greatly from projections. 3.2.3.4 Impact of modal factor \u00b6 Life insurance premiums are normally quoted on an annual basis, and premiums are payable in advance. The annual premium paid at the beginning of the year gives the insurance company the funds to invest for the year. However, a policyholder is given the option of paying the premium monthly, quarterly or semi-annually. When a policyholder chooses one of these payment schedules, the insurance company compensates for not having access to the full sum for the year by charging a modal factor to the policyholder. The modal factor means the policyholder pays more for the premium. The modal factor reflects lost investment income that the insurance company could have earned on an annual premium. When an individual opts for a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual payment schedule, the premium paid will always be higher than the annual premium due to the modal factor being applied. Monthly premium = annual premium \u00d7 modal factor Sample modal factors for term and whole life policies are shown in Table 3.1. Example Victor bought a whole life policy with an annual premium of $956, but he wants to pay the premiums monthly. If the modal factor is 0.088, his monthly premiums will be $84.13, calculated as ( $956 \u00d7 0.088). Over the course of one year, he will pay a total of $1009.56 in premiums, calculated as ( $84.13 \u00d7 12). This annualized premium is 6% higher than the quoted annual premium. 3.2.4 Premium Options \u00b6 Premiums never increase regardless of the way they are paid. Depending on the whole life insurance contract, the policyholder may have several options for paying premiums such as the following options discussed below. 3.2.4.1 Ongoing Premiums \u00b6 This traditional premium is paid at a fixed price on an ongoing basis for life or until the policyholder surrenders the policy. This form of premium can be called a lifetime-pay policy. Example Helena is 40 years old, a non-smoker and in excellent health. She just obtained a $500,000 whole life policy on her own life. Her premiums will be $11,065 annually and they are guaranteed to never increase. 3.2.4.2 Single Premium \u00b6 The premium can be paid once in a lump sum. The policy is then paid up and no other premiums are required to keep the policy in force for the life of the life insured. A single premium policy is a paid-up policy. 3.2.4.3 Limited Payment \u00b6 Premium payment may be limited to a set number of years or to a set age. At the end of the period, the policy is then paid up. This form of whole life is detailed in Section 3.6. 3.2.5 Death Benefit Options \u00b6 Depending on the insurance company, the policyholder may also have some choice as to how the death benefit is determined. The policyholder has a choice between guaranteed whole life and adjustable whole life. 3.2.5.1 Guaranteed Whole Life \u00b6 As its name indicates, this form of policy guarantees the death benefit and a set premium. The insurance company takes on all the risk with a guaranteed whole life insurance policy due to its assumptions about pricing factors. 3.2.5.2 Adjustable Whole Life \u00b6 With this form of whole life insurance, the death benefit and premiums are guaranteed for a certain period of time (i.e., 5 years). At the end of the guarantee period, the insurance company will compare its mortality cost projections to its actual experience and will update its assumptions about mortality costs, expenses and investment returns. Based on its review, the insurance may adjust the policy by increasing or decreasing either the premiums, the death benefit or both. Premiums are typically lower in an adjustable whole life policy because the policyholder is exposed to more risk than with a comparable guaranteed whole life policy. As such: If the insurance company\u2019s actual expenses/costs are higher or investment returns are lower than it has forecast, premiums may increase or the death benefit may decrease. If the insurance company\u2019s actual expenses/costs are lower or investment returns are higher than it has forecast, premiums may decrease or the death benefit may increase. If the insurance company\u2019s actual expenses/costs are in line with forecasts, premiums or the death benefit may remain unchanged. While available, adjustable policies are no longer in common use in Canada. Example 1 Ranjit purchased an adjustable whole life policy 10 years ago, with an annual premium of $6,500 guaranteed for 10 years. As a result of its 10-year review, the insurance company determined that men who had purchased the same policy as Ranjit are actually living longer than expected, so the company has had to pay out less death benefits than expected. The insurance company reduced Ranjit\u2019s premiums to $6,415 annually, guaranteed for the next 10 years. Example 2 Helmuth purchased an adjustable whole life policy five years ago, with an annual premium of $11,600 guaranteed for five years. As a result of its five-year review, his insurance company noted that market interest rates had dropped and that as a result they have earned less income on their policy reserves than expected. The insurance company increased Helmuth\u2019s premiums to $12,100, guaranteed for the next five years. 3.3 Non-Participating vs. Participating Whole Life Policies \u00b6 Whole life policies can be either participating or non-participating depending on how the insurance company handles any surpluses that result from the policies. Participating policies offer the policyholder the option of receiving a share of the insurance company\u2019s surplus revenues in the form of a dividend; Non-participating policies keep surplus revenues as retained earnings which increases the company\u2019s shareholder equity. 3.3.1 How Shortfalls or Surpluses Occur \u00b6 Recall that insurance companies forecast mortality costs, administrative expenses and investment returns based on assumptions made about life expectancy, probability of death and economic/market conditions. These forecasts can be wrong: Mortality costs can be lower or higher than expected (fewer or more people die); Investment return can be higher or lower than predicted; and Administrative expenses can be higher or lower than estimated. To the extent that actual mortality costs and expenses are lower than expected and investment returns are higher, the insurance company will have surplus revenue: Surplus revenue (i.e., when revenues are more than the company needs for its administrative expenses) will first be used to top up company policy reserves. Insurance regulators specify a minimum level of reserves that must be maintained to meet future liabilities (pay out death benefits); After reserve levels are met, the surplus becomes company profit; and If there is a shortfall (i.e., when revenues are less than the company needs for its administrative expenses), the company must call upon its financial resources. It cannot seek more in premiums or reduce death benefits. 3.3.2 Non-Participating Policies \u00b6 A non-participating, or non-par policy, does not share any company surplus to its policyholders. Surplus revenues are first used to maintain policy reserve levels as required by provincial regulators. After policy reserves are met, excess revenues are kept as profit. Profits are added to the insurance company\u2019s retained earnings which increases the company\u2019s shareholder\u2019s equity. Alternatively, some or all of the profit can be paid out to the shareholders as taxable corporate dividends. Inaccurate assumptions regarding non-participating policies can result in revenue shortfall for the insurance company. The insurance company, and not the policy or the policyholder, bears the burden of this loss. 3.3.3 Participating Policies \u00b6 A policy that is structured to pay the dividend is called a participating policy (also called a par policy). With a participating policy, the insurance company will first use excess revenues to meet their regulatory requirement to maintain policy reserves at specific levels. To the extent that excess returns are not needed to maintain policy reserves, the insurance company may return some or all of the revenue surplus to its policyholders in the form of dividends. These dividends are not to be confused with corporate dividends. The dividend paid to a par policy owner is not the same as a dividend paid to an investor who owns shares of a company. Dividends are not guaranteed. The agent must disclose to a prospect that there is no guarantee that a dividend will be paid. The insurance company bears the responsibility alone for revenue losses resulting from inaccurate assumptions regarding participating policies. Participating policyholders have the potential to share in revenue surpluses. Therefore, the premiums are higher than for non-participating policies. 3.3.3.1 Identifying the Difference \u00b6 Most participating whole life insurance products include the word \u201cparticipating\u201d in the product name. Also, participating policy contracts will clearly specify how and when policy dividends will be paid, and will include a caveat that policy dividends are not guaranteed and are only paid at the discretion of the insurance company\u2019s Board of Directors. 3.4 Dividend Payment Options for Participating Policies \u00b6 When he applies for a policy, the policyholder may choose from a variety of options with regard to how he wishes to receive the dividends. He can switch to another option at a later date. The most common dividend options are: Cash; Premium reduction; Accumulation; Paid-up additions (PUA); Term insurance; Impact on death benefits and cash values. 3.4.1 Cash \u00b6 The policyholder can choose to receive the dividend in cash. It is issued by cheque to the policyholder or by direct deposit to the policyholder\u2019s account at a financial institution. Who benefits? This form of dividend use is best for the policyholder because he receives cash in hand to use as he wishes\u2014if he chooses he can use the money to pay premiums or to repay a policy loan. 3.4.2 Premium Reduction \u00b6 The policyholder can choose to apply the dividend directly against the premium for the following year. It will reduce the amount of premium to be paid by the policyholder. This is also called premium offset. In earlier years, the policy dividend is usually less than the premium. However, in later years, the policy dividend may be more than the premium completely offsetting the annual premium. If the policy dividend exceeds the premium, the policyholder can choose to have the excess paid out or allocated to one of the other dividend options available. Who benefits? This form of dividend use benefits the policyholder because his premium cost is reduced. 3.4.3 Accumulation \u00b6 If the policyholder chooses the accumulation option, the policy dividends will be deposited into a separate accumulation account called a \u201cside account.\u201d The accumulated dividend in the side account is invested to provide additional growth. The value of the account can be withdrawn by the policyholder whenever he chooses. Account growth in the side account is taxable to the policyholder. The value that accumulates in the side account can increase the death benefit so long as it is not withdrawn first. Who benefits? This form of dividend benefits the policyholder who can access cash via withdrawals as well as the beneficiary because the death benefit is increased by the accumulated value. 3.4.3.1 Investment Options \u00b6 Dividends deposited to the side account earn interest. The policyholder may choose to invest in segregated funds instead of earning interest. Segregated funds are an insurance industry investment with some similarities to mutual funds. 3.4.3.2 Upon Death \u00b6 The value of the side account is paid to the beneficiary along with the death benefit when the policyholder dies. 3.4.4 Paid-up additions (PUA) \u00b6 The policyholder can choose to use the dividend as a single premium to buy more whole life insurance. These are known as paid-up additions (PUA). Each addition to the base policy is paid up, hence, the name \u201cpaid-up addition.\u201d Each PUA is its own policy with its own death benefit and cash surrender value (CSV). Its coverage is a result of the amount of dividend and the attained age of the life insured. A PUA can be surrendered without affecting the base policy or other additions. Additions can be cashed in and used to pay premiums and, therefore, also achieve premium offset (the same as the premium reduction method that appears in 3.4.2). Paid-up additions increase the death benefit without the need to provide evidence of insurability. Thus, PUAs can be used to increase the amount of insurance coverage even if the life insured\u2019s health has deteriorated to the point where he/she would no longer qualify for new insurance coverage. Therefore, PUAs are the most popular dividend payment option\u2014over 90% of whole life policies sold use this option. Who benefits? This form of dividend use benefits both the policyholder, who can use PUAs to reduce premium expense, and the beneficiary by increasing the death benefit. 3.4.5 Term Insurance \u00b6 The policyholder can choose to use the dividend as a single premium to pay for a one-year term insurance policy. The term policy has its own death benefit, which is paid if death occurs during the year. Like a PUA, the term insurance coverage is a result of the amount of dividend and the attained age of the life insured. Medical evidence of insurability for the additional term insurance is not required. Who benefits? This form of dividend use is best for the beneficiary if death occurs during the year because the death benefit is increased. 3.4.6 Impact on Death Benefits and Cash Values \u00b6 Participating policy dividend payment options have different effects on the death benefit and the CSV of the policy: Paid-up additions may increase both the CSV and the death benefit; The accumulation option may increase the death benefit if the accumulated dividends have not been withdrawn by the policyholder; and The term insurance option may temporarily increase the death benefit (for the length of the one-year term only). 3.4.6.1 Dividend Illustrations \u00b6 A dividend illustration is a chart or graph that an agent uses to help policyholders understand how participating policies work and to visualize the dividends and their effect on death benefits and cash values. Dividends are based on a dividend scale constructed by the insurance company. The scale groups policies into blocks; each block has its own expenses and investment return assumptions. The dividend illustration is based on the dividend scale. The illustration is a projection of what might happen in the future. It is not guaranteed because no one can predict what the future holds. If only one projection is presented to a potential policyholder, an impression can be created that the returns in the illustration are a sure thing. To overcome this expectation, dividend illustrations are usually based on at least two dividend scales: one is less optimistic than the other. 3.5 Non-Forfeiture Benefits \u00b6 Non-forfeiture benefits are advantages received by the policyholder that result from paying premiums and building a cash reserve. These benefits are not forfeited when the policy is cancelled, even if the cancellation is due to the non-payment of premiums. The longer the cash reserves build, the greater the values available for the non-forfeiture benefits. Therefore, a policy that has been in force for 25 years will have larger sums available in non-forfeiture benefits than a policy that has been in force for five years. Depending on the insurance company and the policy, the policyholder may be able to take advantage of one or more of the following non-forfeiture benefits: Cash surrender value; Automatic premium loan (APL); Reduced paid-up insurance; and Extended term insurance. 3.5.1 Cash Surrender Value (CSV) \u00b6 A whole life policyholder can surrender (i.e., cancel) his policy at any time. He will receive the cash surrender value of the policy from the insurance company. In comparing the cancellation of a whole life policy to a term policy: the term policyholder receives nothing. A portion of the CSV that the policyholder receives will be taxable. Typically, a whole life insurance policy will indicate what the guaranteed CSV will be at the end of each policy year. The illustration may also show a non-guaranteed CSV amount that may result from the policy\u2019s dividends if it is a participating policy with a PUA option. Why take the CSV? Need for insurance coverage has changed; Ability to pay for insurance has changed. 3.5.1.1 Surrender Charges \u00b6 Surrender charges are usually levied against a policy\u2019s cash value to discourage the policyholder from cashing in the policy before the insurance company can recover the expenses (underwriting and administrative costs, agent commissions) incurred for issuing the policy. A fee is charged by the insurance company to surrender the policy. It is deducted from the CSV before it is paid out. Surrender charges decrease over time and are eventually eliminated. For whole life insurance policies, the surrender charges are not typically specified in the insurance contract. Rather, the illustration of the policy\u2019s guaranteed CSV will show $0 for the first three to ten years before beginning to increase gradually. 3.5.1.2 Policy Loans \u00b6 Up to 90% of the CSV is available to the policyholder as a policy loan. The loan does not have a specified repayment schedule. Interest is charged on the loan and accumulates if the loan and interest are not repaid. The amount of the loan and its unpaid interest are deducted when: The policy is surrendered. The deduction is made from the CSV. The life insured dies. The deduction is made from the death benefit. Why take a policy loan? Other sources of borrowing are unavailable; A large CSV exists; The loan does not appear in credit reports. Example Yolanda owned a $500,000 whole life policy on her own life with a CSV of $120,000. She took an $80,000 policy loan to use as the down payment for a cottage, and the loan\u2019s interest rate is 5%, compounded annually. Two years later, she decided to surrender the policy. At that time, the CSV had increased to $136,000 and she still had not made any payments on the loan. Yolanda will receive $47,800 upon surrendering her policy, which is calculated as the CSV of $136,000, minus the $80,000 outstanding loan and minus accrued interest of $8,200. If she had died instead of surrendering the policy, her beneficiary would have received $411,800, which is calculated as the death benefit of $500,000, minus the $80,000 loan and the $8,200 in accrued interest. 3.5.2 Automatic Premium Loans (APL) \u00b6 It is essential for premiums to be paid to keep a policy in force unless the policy is paid up. The APL is a loan that uses the cash surrender value of a policy to make individual premium payments if the policyholder fails to make a scheduled premium payment. Interest is charged against each loan. The APL occurs automatically when the premium goes unpaid or if the policyholder gives permission for the loan or loans. A premium loan can be taken from the CSV once or many times. The policy will state a limit on what can be taken in loans. When the policy loan limit is reached (usually between 90% and 100% of the CSV), plus a 30-day grace period, the policy terminates and the residual CSV, if any will be paid to the policyholder. Like a usual policy loan, the outstanding balance and interest of any APLs will be deducted from the death benefit. What is the benefit of the APL? It prevents policy lapse due to forgetfulness; It eases financial pressure on a policyholder whose financial situation prevents usual premium payments. Example Ella owns a $500,000 whole life insurance policy with a CSV of $226,000 and annual premiums of $11,500. She has been forced into early retirement, resulting in a substantial drop in income. She would like to keep the policy in force to meet her estate planning needs, but she cannot afford the premiums until her Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) benefits commence in about five years. Ella can skip premiums for the next five years by using the APL provision because she has enough CSV to support this option. While this will reduce the death benefit by the amount of the unpaid premiums plus interest, it will allow her to keep the policy. She will also always have the option of repaying the loan and interest if/when she can afford to, which would restore the death benefit. 3.5.3 Reduced Paid-Up Insurance \u00b6 This is an option for a policyholder who wants insurance coverage without continuing to pay premiums. It provides the policyholder with paid-up insurance. The reduced paid-up insurance is acquired when the CSV of a policy is converted into a single premium. That premium pays for a new whole life policy with a smaller face amount than the original policy. The amount of coverage is determined by the amount of CSV available and the attained age of the life insured. There is no need for medical evidence of insurability. Reduced paid-up insurance results in a smaller death benefit as well as permanent coverage. Example (cont.) If Ella feels that she will never again be able to afford the $11,500 in annual premiums on her $500,000 whole life policy, she may be able to use the CSV of $226,000 (assuming she never exercised the APL option) as a single premium to purchase a paid-up permanent insurance policy. The exact amount of the death benefit will depend on her age, but it will be less than the $500,000 provided by her original policy. 3.5.4 Extended Term Insurance \u00b6 This is another option for a policyholder who wants insurance coverage without continuing to pay premiums. It also provides paid-up insurance but converts the whole life policy into a term policy. The extended term insurance is acquired in the same way as reduced paid-up insurance: the CSV of a policy forms a single premium. However, with this option, the premium pays for a new term policy with the same face amount as the original whole life policy. The duration of the new policy\u2019s term is determined by the amount of CSV available and the attained age of the life insured: A large CSV and a young attained age might pay for a term policy that expires in many years; A large CSV and an older attained age might pay for a term policy that expires in years, but fewer years than when the policyholder is younger. There is no need for medical evidence of insurability. In sum, extended term insurance results in the same death benefit as well as temporary insurance coverage. Example (cont.) If Ella feels that she will never again be able to afford the $11,500 in annual premiums on her $500,000 whole life policy but she wants to keep coverage for the full $500,000 in place as long as possible, she may be able to use the CSV of $226,000 (assuming she never exercised the APL option) as a single premium to buy $500,000 of term insurance. The exact term of that policy will depend on her age. 3.6 Limited Payment Whole Life \u00b6 Limited payment life is a whole life insurance policy that provides lifelong insurance coverage, while limiting the premium payment period to a set number of years or to a specific age. Once premiums are no longer required, the policy is said to endow. The premiums for a limited pay policy will be higher than for a whole life policy where premiums are payable for life. This is because the life insurance coverage continues after the premium payments stop. The insurance company determines the limited payment premiums based on the sum of premiums the policyholder would pay for his entire life (based on his assumed life expectancy). The company uses this sum to determine the premiums it would have to collect over the limited payment period to obtain the same financial result. Why choose limited payment over lifetime pay? The policyholder knows when his premium commitment ends; The policyholder can coordinate premium payments with income\u2014premiums can be timed to end at retirement; The policyholder avoids longevity risk in which he could be paying premiums for a life insured who lives longer than anticipated. 3.7 Premium Offset Policies \u00b6 Premium offset refers to the use of policy dividends to reduce the amount of premiums paid by the policyholder. It is not a type of policy but rather an option. Premium offsets can be achieved by: Premium reduction that uses policy dividends to pay premiums directly; Paid-up additions in which annual dividends are used as a single premium to purchase additional paid-up insurance. These PUAs have their own CSV which grows over time. These PUAs are then cashed in and the CSV is used along with annual dividends to cover the required premiums. What is the benefit of premium offset? Policyholders pay less; therefore, they may be more easily persuaded to buy a par policy. 3.7.1 Illustrations and Disclosure \u00b6 Agents need to exercise caution when marketing policies with these provisions to prospective clients because policy dividends are not guaranteed. Agents must clearly relate to the policyholder that the illustrations are based on the present dividend scale and that the dividend scale could fluctuate. Policyholders must understand that small changes in the dividend scale could produce drastically different results. Therefore, the benefits associated with dividends may not materialize if the dividends are not paid or deviate from the dividend scale. 3.8 Advantages and Disadvantages of Whole Life Insurance \u00b6 The advantages and disadvantages of whole life insurance policies are summarized in Table 3.2. 3.9 Comparing Term and Whole Life Insurance \u00b6 Table 3.3 summarizes the differences between term insurance and whole life insurance. 3.10 Using Whole Life Insurance \u00b6 A whole life policy is an appropriate choice when: The need for insurance is permanent, that is, the policyholder enters the policy for purposes that arise at the end of life for the life insured; The policyholder will be able to afford the premiums for the selected premium payment schedule (i.e., once, limited, lifetime); The policyholder is willing to pay the premiums over the entire payment period; The policyholder wants insurance coverage to increase, for instance, to keep pace with inflation, and is prepared to select a par policy that will accomplish that objective; and The policyholder does not want an investment aspect to his policy. 3.10.1 Taxes Upon Death \u00b6 One purpose for the death benefit from a whole life policy (and other forms of permanent insurance) is to pay income tax that becomes due on death. The use of insurance to cover tax liabilities at death allow for the value of the estate to remain intact and not decrease by the taxes due. Such taxes apply to investment assets, non-principal residences such as a cottage, and to business shares of private companies. Example Henry is 50 years old and he is in great health. He is widowed with one son, Jack, who is currently 14 years old. Henry and Jack enjoy the time they spend together at the cottage, and Henry would like Jack to receive title to the property when he dies. Based on his family history, Henry believes he will live until at least age 90. Henry expects the value of the cottage to triple by the time he dies, and he is worried that there will not be enough money in his estate to pay the income tax on the taxable capital gain that will result from the deemed disposition of the cottage when he dies. He estimates that this tax liability could be $200,000 or even higher, depending on the real estate market. Henry would like to use life insurance to make sure that this risk is covered. However, he will not be able to get term insurance coverage that lasts until age 90 or beyond. A whole life policy would give him the protection he is looking for. Example If he changes his mind about leaving the cottage to Jack and he instead decides to sell the cottage before he dies, he can always keep the policy for other estate needs or surrender the policy and use the cash surrender value (CSV) as he chooses. Eric is already 45, and he had not even considered life insurance until his recent marriage and the birth of his son, Oliver, last year. Eric\u2019s sedentary lifestyle has resulted in him being overweight, with high blood pressure and the onset of Type 2 diabetes. He was dismayed to learn how much the life insurance would cost because of his health, and even more dismayed to learn how much cheaper it would have been had he bought it when he was young and healthy. This prompted him to purchase a whole life policy on Oliver\u2019s life, so he would always have insurance protection. When Oliver is an adult, Eric can transfer ownership of the policy to him, with the added benefit that Oliver will be able to take out a policy loan against the CSV if needed for his education or for the down payment on a home. 3.10.2 Future Insurability \u00b6 Whole life insurance provides a lifetime guaranteed insurance coverage at a fixed price as long as premiums are paid. If acquired when an individual is young or before health concerns arise, it can be more affordable than when acquired later in life or once health issues surface. As health deteriorates, one runs the risk of being uninsurable for new insurance coverage. 3.10.3 Increasing Coverage \u00b6 Participating policies provide easy ways for the amount of life insurance coverage to increase over time without the need to provide medical evidence of insurability. Example Tony is 33 years old with a young family, and he would like to obtain life insurance coverage for 10 times his salary. His salary is currently $60,000, but he expects it to increase dramatically over the coming years. He would like his new insurance coverage to keep pace with the increases in his salary, preferably without increasing his premiums. While Tony is currently in good health and would have no trouble obtaining life insurance, he knows that his father and his uncle both started experiencing significant health issues at about age 40. Tony is worried that if his health follows family history, he might be unable to buy additional coverage at an affordable cost in the future. A $600,000 participating whole life policy with a paid-up addition (PUA) option would be a good choice for Tony. The PUAs will increase his coverage without increasing his premiums, and without requiring proof of insurability. If it turns out that the PUAs add more coverage than Tony needs, he can always use the additional coverage to address other estate needs or surrender part of the policy and use the resulting cash surrender value (CSV) for other purposes. 3.11 Term-to-100 Insurance \u00b6 Term-100 (T-100) combines elements of term insurance and permanent insurance. 3.11.1 Duration of Coverage \u00b6 T-100 provides lifelong coverage: Some policies mature at age 100 and pay the death benefit when the life insured reaches aged 100 or dies\u2014whichever comes first; or Some policies only pay the death benefit when the life insured dies but the premiums cease at age 100. 3.11.2 Premiums \u00b6 Premiums cease at age 100, even in the death benefit has not yet been paid out. Premium cost is lower than whole life insurance and higher than the term (for an equivalent amount of coverage) because T-100 policies do not accumulate a CSV and do not provide non-forfeiture benefits. Automatic premium loans (APL) are not available to cover missed premium payments. Thus, a missed premium that is not paid by the policyholder within the 30-day grace period can lead to a lapsed, or cancelled, policy. Some policies give the policyholder the opportunity to reactivate their lapsed policy within a set period of time. Missed premiums must be paid. 3.11.2.1 Level Cost of Insurance (LCOI) \u00b6 Most T-100 policies charge a level premium for the duration of the policy referred to as a level cost of insurance (LCOI). LCOI does not provide for the accumulation of any cash surrender value or other non-forfeiture benefits. Premiums are based on the attained age of the life insured at policy issue. The younger the life insured is at the time of the issue, the lower the premiums for life. 3.11.2.2 Limited Payment T-100 \u00b6 Like limited payment whole life, premium payment for T-100 may be limited to a set number of years or to a set age. At the end of the period, the policy is then paid up. Because premiums are paid over a shorter period of time, the premiums for a limited pay T-100 are higher than that for a straight T-100 policy. T-100 policies that are limited payment have a CSV. Its value can be received by the policyholder if he has no need for the policy. The CSV can also provide automatic premium loans, like a whole life policy. 3.11.3 Death Benefit \u00b6 The death benefit is equal to the face amount of the policy and is fixed for the contract duration. 3.11.4 Upon Age 100 \u00b6 What happens when the life insured reaches age 100 depends on the insurance company and the details of the contract. Some policies specify that the death benefit will be paid to the beneficiary when the life insured turns 100. Other policies specify that the payment of premiums ceases at age 100, but coverage continues until death. 3.11.5 Availability from Insurers \u00b6 Basic T-100 policies (those without a CSV and with premiums payable until age 100) are readily available from major insurance companies and other financial institutions. Limited-payment T-100 policies are no longer common in Canada, but they are available in the U.S. market. 3.11.6 Using Term-100 \u00b6 Term-100 insurance may be appropriate when the following conditions apply: The policyholder requires a fixed amount of insurance to cover a need that is not expected to increase prior to death, regardless of when that death might occur; The policyholder is certain that he will never want to surrender the policy; The policyholder has no need of the investment opportunities provided by universal life (UL) insurance. Example Trevor recently lost his wife after a long battle against cancer. He was overwhelmed by the support that the local Hospice Centre provided to his wife, himself and their children during the last two months before she died. Trevor is absolutely determined to donate $500,000 to the Hospice Centre upon his own death. Trevor decided to buy a $500,000 T-100 policy now, while the premiums are still affordable, because this will ensure that he will be able to make that gift even if he lives to be 110 and depletes all of his own resources. He has no intention of ever cancelling the policy, so he does not need a policy that builds up a cash surrender value (CSV).","title":"Chapter 3 Whole Life and Term-100 Insurance"},{"location":"life/Chapter_3_Whole_Life_and_Term-100_Insurance/#chapter-3-whole-life-and-term-100-insurance","text":"","title":"Chapter 3: Whole Life and Term-100 Insurance"},{"location":"life/Chapter_3_Whole_Life_and_Term-100_Insurance/#31-concept-of-permanent-insurance","text":"Permanent life insurance is exactly what its name suggests: permanent.

The annual premium paid at the beginning of the year gives the insurance company the funds to invest for the year. However, a policyholder is given the option of paying the premium monthly, quarterly or semi-annually. When a policyholder chooses one of these payment schedules, the insurance company compensates for not having access to the full sum for the year by charging a modal factor to the policyholder. The modal factor means the policyholder pays more for the premium. The modal factor reflects lost investment income that the insurance company could have earned on an annual premium. When an individual opts for a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual payment schedule, the premium paid will always be higher than the annual premium due to the modal factor being applied. Monthly premium = annual premium \u00d7 modal factor Sample modal factors for term and whole life policies are shown in Table 3.1.

Based on its review, the insurance may adjust the policy by increasing or decreasing either the premiums, the death benefit or both. Premiums are typically lower in an adjustable whole life policy because the policyholder is exposed to more risk than with a comparable guaranteed whole life policy. As such: If the insurance company\u2019s actual expenses/costs are higher or investment returns are lower than it has forecast, premiums may increase or the death benefit may decrease. If the insurance company\u2019s actual expenses/costs are lower or investment returns are higher than it has forecast, premiums may decrease or the death benefit may increase.

Insurance regulators specify a minimum level of reserves that must be maintained to meet future liabilities (pay out death benefits); After reserve levels are met, the surplus becomes company profit; and If there is a shortfall (i.e., when revenues are less than the company needs for its administrative expenses), the company must call upon its financial resources.

He is widowed with one son, Jack, who is currently 14 years old. Henry and Jack enjoy the time they spend together at the cottage, and Henry would like Jack to receive title to the property when he dies. Based on his family history, Henry believes he will live until at least age 90. Henry expects the value of the cottage to triple by the time he dies, and he is worried that there will not be enough money in his estate to pay the income tax on the taxable capital gain that will result from the deemed disposition of the cottage when he dies. He estimates that this tax liability could be $200,000 or even higher, depending on the real estate market. Henry would like to use life insurance to make sure that this risk is covered. However, he will not be able to get term insurance coverage that lasts until age 90 or beyond. A whole life policy would give him the protection he is looking for. Example If he changes his mind about leaving the cottage to Jack and he instead decides to sell the cottage before he dies, he can always keep the policy for other estate needs or surrender the policy and use the cash surrender value (CSV) as he chooses.

In a whole life policy, these three factors are bundled together. The policyholder does not know how much of the premium paid gets applied to which cost or expense. Universal life (UL) policies reveal how each of three cost factors is calculated and applied to an individual policy. Thus, UL policies provide: Transparency since the information is openly disclosed; and Unbundling since the factors are clearly separated from each other. Policyholders can better understand their policy and its cash value when they have this information available. The cash value in a UL policy is the value of the investment account. 4.1.1 Premium Tax \u00b6 Contracts and sales literature refer to the amounts that a policyholder pays into a UL policy as \u201cdeposits\u201d and not \u201cpremiums\u201d due to their role as both an insurance and investment option. However, for consistency, we will use the term \u201cpremiums\u201d to refer to them. A provincial tax, between 2% and 4%, is charged on all premiums paid into a UL policy. This premium tax reduces the amount deposited to the investment account, the remainder of which goes into the policy\u2019s investment account(s). Universal Life Insurance The policyholder can avoid this premium tax by investing that same money outside of a UL policy (for example, by investing in mutual funds or GICs). 4.1.2 Mortality Charges \u00b6 As with term and whole life policies, the mortality costs for UL policies reflect the insurance company\u2019s cost of paying out the death benefits. The insurance company deducts the mortality costs from the investment account. Later in this Chapter in Section 4.3, you will learn that the policyholder has some choice around how the mortality costs are calculated. 4.1.3 Administrative Expenses \u00b6 Administrative expenses of the insurance company are its costs of \u201cdoing business.\u201d The expenses include: Selling costs (marketing, agent commissions); Underwriting and issuing policies; Costs associated with investigating and paying claims; Income taxes. These costs are deducted from the policyholder\u2019s investment account as a percentage of the annual deposit to the account or as a flat monthly fee. Because of its complexity, the costs for a UL policy are higher than for term, whole life or T-100. 4.1.4 Investment Income \u00b6 There are many investments from which the policyholder may choose. Details about investments are discussed in more detail in the Investment Choices Section. Because the policyholder sees how the mortality costs and administrative charges are calculated, the policyholder gets a clear picture of how investments are performing. Investment growth is tax-free, providing it is less than the limits set out in the Income Tax Act. This will be discussed more in the Exemption Test Section. 4.2 Flexibility for the Policyholder \u00b6 UL insurance provides many options for the policyholder when the policy is issued and while it continues to be in force. Changes can be made to best suit evolving policyholder needs. The following factors are all flexible (that is, changeable) in a UL policy: The timing and amount of premiums; The face amount; Recall that the face amount is the amount of insurance taken out; death benefit is the amount received by the beneficiary when the life insured dies. These two sums can be quite different. The life or lives insured. 4.2.1 Timing and Amount of Premiums \u00b6 Within specified limits, the policyholder can decide how much and when to pay premiums. There is a minimum premium requirement, a maximum premium limit, and premium flexibility in between these two extremes. All deposits go to the investment account. The minimum premium pays the life insured\u2019s mortality costs, the policyholder\u2019s administrative expenses, and premium tax and is designed to keep the policy in force until age 100. When the minimum premium is paid, the account is said to be minimally funded as the minimum premium is not enough to build up the investment account within the policy. The maximum premium respects the deposit limit in order to keep the policy tax exempt. When the maximum premium is paid, the account is said to be maximum-funded. Deposit flexibility is available between making the smallest deposit and making the largest. This flexibility permits lump sum deposits and higher regular deposits to be made, as desired. These premium deposits build the investment account value. When the account is more than minimally funded\u2014it has more value than needed to pay associated account costs. Premiums deposits can be reduced or stopped for a period of time and withdrawals can be made as long as the investment account can support the insurance company\u2019s mortality and expense deductions. Example Elaine has a UL policy on her own life. The policy specifies minimum premiums of $325 per month, but she currently deposits premiums of $500 per month, and the policy has a cash value of $2,900. 4.2.1.1 Insufficient Account Value \u00b6 If the account value cannot pay the mortality cost and policy expenses, the policy could lapse. Insufficient account value can be the result of: Minimum funding; Withdrawals from the policy; Few or no deposits to the account; Low or negative investment returns. Example (cont.) Elaine is pregnant and she plans to take a one-year maternity leave from her job, which will result in decreased income for that period. To ease the pressure on her cash flow, Elaine can reduce her premiums, or even stop paying premiums for a period of time. If she stops the premiums entirely, the policy would likely lapse after about eight or nine months ( $2,900 \u00f7 $325) because the account value would be exhausted by the mortality and expense deductions. 4.2.1.2 Modal Factors for UL Policies \u00b6 For term insurance and whole life insurance policies, the modal factors almost always reflect an interest charge that the policyholder must pay to the insurance company in exchange for spreading the premium out over a series of payments. For most UL policies the modal factor is: 1 \u00f7 number of payments per year Therefore, the insurance company does not apply the modal factor to this type of policy. Example In Section 3.2.3.4, an example showed a term policy with a modal factor of 0.088, such that an annual premium of $956 became a monthly premium of $84.13, calculated as ( $956 \u00d7 0.088). Over the course of one year, the total premiums would be $1,009.56, calculated as ( $84.13 \u00d7 12), which is 6% higher than the quoted premium of $956. For the majority of universal life policies: Modal factor for monthly payments is 0.0833 calculated as (1 \u00f7 12). Modal factor for semiannual policy is 0.50 calculated as (1 \u00f7 2). In this case, the annual and annualized premiums are the same. 4.2.2 Face Amount \u00b6 The face amount is specified when the policy is taken out. The policyholder can add additional coverage to the policy in the future subject to providing evidence of insurability. If the policy has a guaranteed insurability rider (discussed in a later chapter) evidence of insurability is not required. The new premium for the additional coverage will be calculated on an attained age basis. Increases and decreases to the face amount of the policy are usually restricted to a minimum amount (i.e., an increase of $25,000 or decrease of at least $10,000) to minimize the administrative costs involved in making such changes. Changes to the face amount impact the cash value in the policy as mortality costs are directly linked to the face amount. Increased face amounts lead to increased mortality charges. Unless the insurance company compensates by charging higher premiums, this will lead to a smaller amount of premium deposits being available for investment after the mortality charge has been deducted from the investment account. This could result in the erosion of the policy\u2019s cash value. A decreased face amount leads to a decreased mortality charge. More of the premium deposit is available for investment which could result in a higher cash value. Example Richard and Maria, ages 38 and 42, already have two children, ages 15 and 17. Richard has a $500,000 UL policy on his own life. Maria is employed and earns a good salary, and they have no major debts. Richard bought a UL policy a few years ago to ensure that, if he died, Maria would have enough money to raise the children right through their post-secondary education. Much to their surprise, Richard and Maria have just learned that Maria is pregnant with twins. Richard decided to increase his UL coverage by $500,000. He was able to do so within his existing UL policy, after providing proof of insurability. If their cash flow is limited while Maria is on maternity leave and there is sufficient cash value within the policy, Richard may be able to have this increased coverage without increasing his premiums for the time being, as we will discuss shortly. 4.2.3 Life/Lives Insured \u00b6 One universal life (UL) policy can be used to insure multiple lives, either on a joint-life basis, a single-life basis or, depending on the insurance company, sometimes both. Example Joe bought a UL policy that included $500,000 of joint-last-to-die coverage on the lives of himself and his wife, Sherry, and another $1,000,000 in individual coverage on his own life. The joint coverage is payable to the estate of the last to die and is intended to be used to offset the tax liability that will be triggered upon the last of their deaths on certain estate assets they want to leave to their children. The individual coverage is payable to Sherry upon Joe\u2019s death and is intended to help replace the family\u2019s lost income if Joe dies first. The ability to substitute one life insured for another is unique to UL. The substitute person must provide evidence of insurability. Example (cont.) Sherry is no longer able to care for their young children because she was paralyzed in an accident. Joe\u2019s sister, Deborah, has moved in with them and she has become an integral and essential part of the family. Joe decided to add Deborah as a new single life insured under his existing UL policy. Deborah had to provide proof of insurability before Joe could add her to the policy. 4.3 Pricing the Insurance Component \u00b6 The mortality costs deducted from the investment account of a UL policy are a reflection of the net amount at risk and the mortality costing method used which takes into consideration the following: The net amount at risk (NAAR); Whether the mortality cost is based on yearly renewable term (YRT), or Whether the mortality cost is based on the level cost of insurance (LCOI); Whether the mortality deduction is guaranteed or adjustable. 4.3.1 Net Amount at Risk (NAAR) \u00b6 The insurance company\u2019s risk in any policy is the amount that must be paid as the death benefit. The policy reserves that insurance companies build up over time decreases the amount at risk. That risk is called the net amount at risk (NAAR) in a UL policy. NAAR = death benefit - the investment account value Note that the death benefit in this formula refers to the full amount payable upon death. Therefore, The higher the value of the investment account, the lower the NAAR; The lower the NAAR, the lower the mortality charge to the account; and The lower the mortality charge, the more the investment account can grow. Example Patrick owns a UL policy with a death benefit of $500,000 and an account value of $128,000. The current NAAR of his policy is $372,000, calculated as ( $500,000 \u2013 $128,000). 4.3.2 Yearly Renewable Term (YRT) \u00b6 Cost of insurance is expressed as a dollar amount per $1000 of risk (for a UL policy, per $1000 of NAAR). Mortality cost = NAAR \u00d7 COI \u00f7 1000 Example Suppose that for the current policy year, Patrick\u2019s policy had a COI of $18.57. The insurance company would make a mortality deduction of $6,908 from his account, calculated as ( $18.57 \u00d7 $372,000 \u00f7 $1,000). A policyholder can choose between two ways of applying the risk of death to the NAAR: Yearly renewable term (YRT) costing; Level cost of insurance (LCOI) (discussed below in Section 4.3.3). For term insurance: Mortality cost for a period of time (the risk that the life insured will die during that period) = probability of death \u00d7 death benefit YRT is a one-year term insurance that renews at the end of every year. The cost for UL insurance based on YRT per $1000 at risk increases each year because the risk of death increases with age (with the exception of the first few years of life). 4.3.3 Level Cost of Insurance (LCOI) \u00b6 Mortality costing based on a level cost of insurance (LCOI) is based on the premiums for a T-100 policy for which premiums are guaranteed to remain level for life. The amount at risk remains constant and the risk of death is spread evenly over the duration of the policy. For a UL policy based in LCOI, the cost per $1000 of risk remains constant over the duration of the policy. 4.3.4 Choosing between YRT and LCOI Costing \u00b6 Cost of insurance (COI) under YRT is lower in earlier years than the COI for LCOI costing. The lower cost under YRT means lower deductions from the investment account (less is paid for the mortality charge) and more money remains in the investment account to allow investment growth. Therefore, a younger policyholder is well served during the early years of his policy by YRT costing because his mortality cost is low. In later years, mortality charges can be quite high and may erode the policy\u2019s cash value unless there are high investment returns to offset the higher costs. YRT is a good choice if the policyholder would qualify for low term rates and he wants more of his deposit to be invested in the early years of the policy. With LCOI costing, mortality cost deductions are higher in the earlier years. This means that there are higher deductions from the investment account and less premium invested, which can result in lower investment account values. In later years, mortality cost deductions are lower with LCOI than with YRT which will help preserve the policy\u2019s cash value. A switch from YRT to LCOI may be possible; the reverse (going from LCOI to YRT) is usually not permitted. Table 4.1 compares mortality deductions for YRT and LCOI costing methods, for a UL policy purchased for a 40-year-old woman who smokes and is in good health with a death benefit of $500,000 plus account value. 4.3.5 Guaranteed vs. Adjustable Mortality Deductions \u00b6 UL policyholders typically prefer the assurance of knowing exactly how future mortality deductions are going to be calculated. Insurance companies typically prefer being able to adjust the COI schedules to reflect their actual experience with mortality, investment returns, and administrative expenses. Agents should understand policies to determine whether the costing schedules are guaranteed for life or subject to adjustment. Agents should advise clients based on this information. 4.3.5.1 Open-Ended or Restricted Increases \u00b6 An adjustment in costs may be open-ended (no limit to the amount of increase) or restricted. Most adjustable policies place a restriction on increases, such as limiting increases to 25%, 50% or 100% of the original schedule, or a specific dollar amount. 4.4 Death Benefit Options \u00b6 The death benefit is another flexible option in the UL policy. There are a variety of death benefits options available. The most common options are: Level death benefit; Level death benefit plus account value; Level death benefit plus cumulative premiums; and Indexed death benefit. Each one affects the NAAR and the mortality charge deducted from the investment account. Regardless of the option selected, the beneficiary receives the death benefit tax-free. 4.4.1 Level Death Benefit \u00b6 The level death benefit is offered in one of two forms. A death benefit equal to the face amount, regardless of when the life insured dies. For example, face amount = $250,000; death benefit = $250,000 A death benefit equal to the policy\u2019s account value when the account is worth more than the face amount. For example, face amount = $250,000; investment account = $275,000; death benefit = $275,000 Since the NAAR equals the death benefit minus the account value, under this option as the account value grows the NAAR decreases and so too do the mortality deductions from the investment account. Because of the decreasing NAAR over time, the level death benefit option is the least expensive of the death benefit options to the policyholder. It is most suitable for individuals who do not have and will not anticipate an increasing insurance need. 4.4.2 Level Death Benefit Plus Account Value \u00b6 Under the level death benefit plus account value option, the death benefit is the original face amount of the policy plus the value of the investment account. With this option, the NAAR is level over the duration of the policy while the death benefit increases. Because NAAR remain level, mortality deductions will be greater and the investment account will grow at a slower pace than UL policies with a level death benefit. This option is most suitable for individuals who can deposit large premiums in excess of the minimum premium required. 4.4.3 Level Death Benefit Plus Cumulative Premiums \u00b6 Under the level death benefit plus cumulative premiums option, upon death of the life insured, the beneficiary receives the original face amount plus the sum of all premiums paid. The premiums are actually refunded when the life insured dies with this option. This is typically the most expensive death benefit option. With this option the calculation is: NAAR = original face amount + the cumulative premiums - the account value This option reduces the NAAR quickly. The mortality cost deductions are reduced which allows for the investment account to grow at a faster pace. To the extent that the investment account exceeds the original face amount plus cumulative premiums, the insurance company keeps the excess amount. This option insures that premiums are not forfeited by the policyholder if the life insured dies early in the life of the policy. It is most suitable for individuals who plan on maximizing their premiums. 4.4.4 Indexed Death Benefit \u00b6 The indexed death benefit is the face amount indexed for inflation. The face amount increases each year by the inflation rate. Canada\u2019s inflation rate (as shown in the CPI) is currently about 2%. This has a compound effect since every year\u2019s increase is applied to an already-increased death benefit. Over time, such growth can become significant. Policies index the inflation rate to either: The Consumer Price Index (CPI); or The policyholder\u2019s choice of indexation rate between 1% and 8% when acquiring the policy. However, if the account value is greater than the indexed death benefit, the insurance company keeps the difference between the two. Under this option, the NAAR and mortality deductions, increase over time depending on the index rate chosen by the policyholder. This death benefit option is most suitable for individuals desiring to protect an end-of-life risk that is expected to increase over time (i.e., tax liability on assets that will appreciate in value). 4.5 Investment Components \u00b6 The following features are what makes a UL policy unique from other forms of life insurance: Net premiums; Tax deferral; Investment choices; and Impact of return on policy viability. Each will be discussed in detail below. 4.5.1 Net Premiums \u00b6 A gross premium is the total amount of deposit, or premium paid, by the policyholder. The net premium is the money that remains after the premium tax, the mortality charge, and policy expenses are deducted from the gross premium. Therefore: Gross premium - premium tax - mortality charge - expense deductions = net premium The net premium is invested within the policyholder\u2019s investment account. As mortality deductions decrease, the amount available for investment increases (assuming the premiums paid remain constant). 4.5.1.1 Exemption Test \u00b6 One of the main benefits of a UL policy is that it gives the policyholder a way to invest in a tax-sheltered environment. A policy is tested annually to ensure it will be tax exempt. See Chapter 7 for more details on tax exemption of life policies. If it fails the test, or it appears that the policy will fail the test, the net premium may be reduced by the insurance company. In other words, the insurance company limits the amount of the premium going into the policy in premiums to maintain the policy\u2019s tax-free status. If the maximum net premium is exceeded, the excess is deposited to a side fund of the policy. Investment returns in the side account will be taxable. 4.5.2 Tax Deferral \u00b6 Income earned in a UL policy investment account is tax exempt as long as the income earned remains within the policy\u2019s investment account. Investment returns may be reinvested which leads to compound growth and an increase in account value. If the death benefit includes the account value, the investment growth may never be subject to taxation. 4.5.3 Investment Choices \u00b6 The policyholder is responsible for management of his investment account. This differs from other permanent insurance policies where the insurance company is responsible for the investment of policy funds. Net premiums may be directed towards one or many different types of investments. They include but are not restricted to the following. 4.5.3.1 Daily Interest Accounts \u00b6 Daily interest accounts are accounts that offer a usually low interest rate based on the yield of a specified benchmark. The minimum return is 0%. The principal is guaranteed. As such, returns may only be flat or positive, but never negative. 4.5.3.2 Guaranteed Investment Accounts (GIA) \u00b6 Guaranteed investment accounts (GIA) provide a fixed interest rate for a term. Terms begin at one year and last up to 20 years. Offer a guaranteed minimum interest rate based on a specified benchmark. The minimum return is 0%, so the principal is guaranteed. A market value adjustment or penalty may apply if the policyholder redeems the GIA prior to its maturity. Returns may be flat or positive, but never negative. As a GIA matures, the proceeds are rolled over into the policy\u2019s active investment account, unless the policyholder requests that they roll over to a new GIA of the same term. 4.5.3.3 Index Fund Investments \u00b6 An index fund investment earns interest based on the returns from a chosen index. Indexes are available based on equities, bonds (or a combination of both), size of market capitalization, or objective (growth or income). Management fees may be charged against the value of the investment. Returns may be flat, positive, or negative. 4.5.3.4 Mutual Fund Investments \u00b6 A mutual fund investment earns interest based on mutual fund returns. Mutual funds are available based on equities, bonds (or a combination of both), size of market capitalization, management style or focused on a specific geographic region. Management fees may be charged against the value of the investment. Returns may be flat, positive, or negative. 4.5.4 Impact of Investment Returns on Policy Viability \u00b6 Deposits, mortality charges, expenses and investment returns affect the value of the investment account and must all be monitored by the policyholder to ensure funds are always available in the investment account to cover costs. If mortality costs increase, the investment account will grow slowly or may decline in value. If investment returns are lower than expected or negative, then the mortality deductions may erode the value of the investment account at a more rapid pace. A shortfall for costs will require extra deposits to be made or the policy could lapse. 4.5.4.1 Policy Illustrations \u00b6 UL policy documentation includes a policy illustration\u2014a chart or table that project values for the deposits, mortality charges, investment account value, cash surrender value, and death benefit for each future year. There are usually two sets of illustrations provided to the potential policyholder: one is based on the current or requested rate of return and the other is at a lower rate of investment return. Insurance agents must advise clients that the illustration is intended to demonstrate how the policy works. It states that the projected returns are not guaranteed and that actual performance may deviate from expected performance. The potential policyholder must sign the illustration provided to him by his agent as evidence that he has seen the document and understands the limitations of the illustration. 4.6 Accumulating Fund \u00b6 The investment fund or accumulating fund of a UL policy provides the policyholder with the following non-forfeiture benefits. Surrendering the policy; Policy withdrawals (partial surrender); Premium offset; Policy loans; Collateral for third-party loans; Leveraging; and Distribution upon death. 4.6.1 Surrendering the Policy \u00b6 A policy may be surrendered and the policyholder will receive the cash value of the investment account minus any applicable surrender charges. Surrender charges apply up to 10 years after policy issue. The surrender charge is a multiple or percentage of the annual mortality cost that would be charged under LCOI costing. It is deducted from the cash surrender value and can reduce CSV to zero, but not less than zero. For example, if the mortality cost is $1,000 and the surrender multiple is 2 the surrender charge is $2,000. If the policy CSV is $1,500, it is reduced to 0 ( $1,500 - $2,000). The charge declines over time and may eventually be eliminated. Tax may apply to the amount received by the policyholder as withdrawals or surrendering the policy may result in a taxable policy gain. 4.6.2 Policy Withdrawals (Partial Surrender) \u00b6 UL is the only type of life insurance policy that permits a withdrawal. The withdrawal is taken from the cash value of the investment account and is considered to be a partial surrender. There is no need to repay a withdrawal. A withdrawal reduces cash value in the account and, if not repaid, reduces the death benefit. A minimum withdrawal amount may be imposed by the insurance company. The maximum withdrawal is the cash surrender value. Surrender charges as well as taxes may apply to the withdrawal. Because mortality costs and expenses are deducted from the investment account, a withdrawal may negatively affect investment growth and the longevity of the policy. Example Andrew has a UL policy with a level death benefit of $200,000 and a current cash value of $21,000. The policy is based on LCOI mortality costing, with mortality deductions of $3,800 per year. Andrew lost his job and he is running short of funds, so he is thinking about withdrawing $20,000 from his UL policy. While his contract allows the withdrawal, Andrew should know that it would reduce his death benefit to $180,000, and the cash value of the policy would decrease to only $1,000. This puts the policy in danger of lapsing because there won\u2019t be enough money in the account to cover the next mortality deduction of $3,800 unless Andrew can deposit additional premiums before the deduction comes due. 4.6.3 Premium Offsets \u00b6 Participating whole life policies provide the policyholder with the choice of using policy dividends to offset their premiums. Premiums are naturally offset by investment income and the policyholder\u2019s deposits to the investment account because of the way the investment account of a UL policy works. Depending on the premiums deposited into the policy and the investment returns earned within the policy, the investment account can grow to such a size that it can be used to fund future mortality and expense deductions indefinitely. The policyholder can stop paying the premiums while maintaining his policy in force. Example Walter bought a $500,000 UL policy several decades ago, based on LCOI mortality deductions of $10,500 annually. Walter always deposited the maximum premium permitted to the policy and he has made some rewarding investment choices. As a result, the policy currently has a cash value of $460,000. Because Walter is currently 65 years old, he could stop paying premiums and the policy would likely remain in force for the duration of his lifetime. However, if he wants to do this, he should adjust his investment mix within the policy to those investments that offer a principal guarantee. 4.6.4 Policy Loans \u00b6 A loan is typically limited to 50% to 90% of the cash value of the investment account. Interest is charged on the loan and is set at the time the loan is taken. There is no requirement to repay the loan. Any unpaid loan balance and accumulated interest will reduce the death benefit. Tax may apply since a policy loan is considered to be a taxable disposition. A benefit of taking out a policy loan, rather than withdrawing money from the policy, is that funds continue to earn tax-sheltered income within the policy\u2019s investment account. On the other hand, the interest rate charged on a policy loan may be higher than the return on the funds. Example Joshua had a UL policy that named his daughter Rebecca as the beneficiary. The policy had a $250,000 level death benefit and a cash surrender value of $35,600 when he took a policy loan of $30,000 at an interest rate of 4% annually to help pay for her post-secondary education. By taking the policy loan, Joshua also had to report taxable income of $1,800, according to the information provided by his insurance company. One year later, Joshua died. Assuming he did not make any principal or interest payments on the policy loan, Rebecca would receive a death benefit of $218,800, calculated as ( $250,000 \u2013 $30,000 \u2013 ( $30,000 \u00d7 4%)). 4.6.5 Collateral for Third-Party Loans \u00b6 The cash value of the investment account can be used as collateral for a loan from a third party, such as a financial institution. The financial institution is assured its loan will be repaid by the policy. Taking a loan from the financial institution, instead of directly from the policy, avoids any possibility of tax. Depending on how the loan is structured, principal and interest payments may not be required. The loan and accumulated interest would be repaid upon the death of the life insured by the death benefit with the residual death benefit going to the beneficiary. Example (cont.) Suppose that instead of taking out a policy loan of $30,000, Joshua had taken a 5-year loan from his local bank at 4% interest, using his UL policy as collateral. At the end of the first year of the loan, Joshua made a repayment of $6,738 to the bank ( $5,538 principal, $1,200 interest). Example (cont.) When Joshua died one year after taking out the loan, the bank received a death benefit of $24,462, calculated as ( $30,000 \u2013 $5,538), and Rebecca received the balance of $225,538, calculated as ( $250,000 \u2013 $24,462). Since the investment account value is not reduced by the amount of the loan, it can continue to grow on a tax-sheltered basis. 4.6.6 Leveraging \u00b6 Leveraging is a variation of a third-party loan where a loan can be obtained using the cash surrender value and the death benefit as collateral. The proceeds of the loan are invested according to the policyholder\u2019s financial objectives. Principal and interest payments are not required. The loan plus accumulated accrued interest would be repaid upon the death of the life insured by the death benefit with the residual death benefit going to the beneficiary. If the loan in invested to produce property income, the interest that accrues against the loan is tax deductible by the policyholder. Using the CSV as collateral avoids any tax liability that might occur if the policyholder took a policy loan or made a withdrawal from the policy. Vital to the success of this strategy is that investment returns must be greater than the cost of borrowing. If the loan plus accrued interest exceeds the cash surrender value, the lender may demand repayment of the loan. Leveraging can be a dangerous strategy if investment returns are lower than anticipated. The policyholder may have to surrender the insurance policy if personal funds are not available to make the repayment. The forced surrender of the policy may result in a potential tax liability. Example Wendy has a UL policy with a $500,000 death benefit and a CSV of $260,000. She retired at 55, earlier than anticipated, and thinks she may need to draw on her UL policy to support her retirement income until her CPP and OAS benefits start. However, if she simply withdraws the money from the policy, it will result in taxable income. Instead, she approached a bank about receiving a loan of $10,000 each year for 10 years, using her UL policy as collateral. She will receive the loan proceeds tax-free, resulting in greater after-tax income than if she had withdrawn $10,000 from the policy each year. Wendy will need to monitor the investment returns earned within the policy, to ensure that the loans and ongoing mortality and expense deductions do not reduce the policy\u2019s cash surrender value to the point where it is less than the outstanding loans plus accrued interest. 4.6.7 Distribution Upon Death \u00b6 The amount paid as the death benefit for each of the death benefit options are as follows: Under the level death benefit option : The insurance company usually only pays out the face amount, although some policies will pay out the value of the investment account that exceeds the policy\u2019s face amount. Under the level death benefit plus account value option : The policy will pay out the original face amount, plus the full value of the investment account.

It is best to use UL policies as an investment vehicle after the repayment of non-deductible debts. 4.9.1 Maxed out registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) and tax-free savings account (TFSA) \u00b6 Individuals who have no available contribution room in their RRSPs and TFSAs can turn to a UL policy to continue to build their tax-deferred savings, particularly if they have a high marginal tax rate. From a tax-efficiency standpoint, repayment of non-deductible debts before using UL insurance policies for investment purposes is also recommended. Example Alistair is 45 years old and a senior project manager at an engineering company. His company offers a defined benefit pension plan, which severely limits his personal RRSP contribution room. He has already maxed out his TFSAs, and he is looking for additional tax-advantaged ways to save for retirement. He also wants $500,000 of life insurance coverage to create a scholarship fund upon his death. Alistair may be interested in a universal life insurance policy. If he maximizes his premiums to the policy, the investment account will grow tax-free. If he chooses a UL policy that pays out the death benefit plus account value upon death, the entire amount will be paid out tax-free, leaving an even larger legacy. 4.9.2 Tax-free retirement income \u00b6 Leveraging a UL policy could provide tax-free retirement income. The UL policy provides collateral for a series of loans. The loans replace income in retirement. In practice, true leveraging is not considered to be appropriate if the person taking a loan for investment purposes has a short time horizon - that is a short amount of time until the investment principal is needed. Most retirees are considered to have short time horizons. Example Joan expects to be in the highest marginal tax rate during her retirement, so she is looking for sources of retirement income that will not be subject to tax. She has already maxed out her tax-free saving account (TFSA) and does not want to put more money into registered retirement savings plans (RRSP) because the withdrawals will be highly taxed due to her marginal tax rate. She can maximum fund a UL policy, which will provide tax-free investment growth. During retirement, she can obtain a series of loans, using the policy\u2019s cash value as collateral. Because she won\u2019t actually be withdrawing the funds, no income tax is triggered. Furthermore, the investment account remains intact, so it can continue to earn tax-free income.","title":"Chapter 4 Universal Life Insurance"},{"location":"life/Chapter_4_Universal_Life_Insurance/#chapter-4-universal-life-insurance","text":"Policies issued prior to January 1, 2017, have been grandfathered and vested rights surrounding tax advantages will be maintained.

There are three factors that determine the premium for all forms of life insurance: Mortality costs (of the life insured), also called the mortality charge; Administrative expenses (of the insurance company); Investment income. In a whole life policy, these three factors are bundled together. The policyholder does not know how much of the premium paid gets applied to which cost or expense. Universal life (UL) policies reveal how each of three cost factors is calculated and applied to an individual policy. Thus, UL policies provide: Transparency since the information is openly disclosed; and Unbundling since the factors are clearly separated from each other.

When the minimum premium is paid, the account is said to be minimally funded as the minimum premium is not enough to build up the investment account within the policy. The maximum premium respects the deposit limit in order to keep the policy tax exempt. When the maximum premium is paid, the account is said to be maximum-funded.

The new premium for the additional coverage will be calculated on an attained age basis. Increases and decreases to the face amount of the policy are usually restricted to a minimum amount (i.e., an increase of $25,000 or decrease of at least $10,000) to minimize the administrative costs involved in making such changes. Changes to the face amount impact the cash value in the policy as mortality costs are directly linked to the face amount. Increased face amounts lead to increased mortality charges. Unless the insurance company compensates by charging higher premiums, this will lead to a smaller amount of premium deposits being available for investment after the mortality charge has been deducted from the investment account. This could result in the erosion of the policy\u2019s cash value. A decreased face amount leads to a decreased mortality charge. More of the premium deposit is available for investment which could result in a higher cash value. Example Richard and Maria, ages 38 and 42, already have two children, ages 15 and 17. Richard has a $500,000 UL policy on his own life. Maria is employed and earns a good salary, and they have no major debts.

Because mortality costs and expenses are deducted from the investment account, a withdrawal may negatively affect investment growth and the longevity of the policy. Example Andrew has a UL policy with a level death benefit of $200,000 and a current cash value of $21,000. The policy is based on LCOI mortality costing, with mortality deductions of $3,800 per year. Andrew lost his job and he is running short of funds, so he is thinking about withdrawing $20,000 from his UL policy. While his contract allows the withdrawal, Andrew should know that it would reduce his death benefit to $180,000, and the cash value of the policy would decrease to only $1,000. This puts the policy in danger of lapsing because there won\u2019t be enough money in the account to cover the next mortality deduction of $3,800 unless Andrew can deposit additional premiums before the deduction comes due.","title":"4.6.2 Policy Withdrawals (Partial Surrender)"},{"location":"life/Chapter_4_Universal_Life_Insurance/#463-premium-offsets","text":"Participating whole life policies provide the policyholder with the choice of using policy dividends to offset their premiums. Premiums are naturally offset by investment income and the policyholder\u2019s deposits to the investment account because of the way the investment account of a UL policy works. Depending on the premiums deposited into the policy and the investment returns earned within the policy, the investment account can grow to such a size that it can be used to fund future mortality and expense deductions indefinitely. The policyholder can stop paying the premiums while maintaining his policy in force. Example Walter bought a $500,000 UL policy several decades ago, based on LCOI mortality deductions of $10,500 annually. Walter always deposited the maximum premium permitted to the policy and he has made some rewarding investment choices. As a result, the policy currently has a cash value of $460,000. Because Walter is currently 65 years old, he could stop paying premiums and the policy would likely remain in force for the duration of his lifetime. However, if he wants to do this, he should adjust his investment mix within the policy to those investments that offer a principal guarantee.","title":"4.6.3 Premium Offsets"},{"location":"life/Chapter_4_Universal_Life_Insurance/#464-policy-loans","text":"A loan is typically limited to 50% to 90% of the cash value of the investment account. Interest is charged on the loan and is set at the time the loan is taken. There is no requirement to repay the loan. Any unpaid loan balance and accumulated interest will reduce the death benefit. Tax may apply since a policy loan is considered to be a taxable disposition. A benefit of taking out a policy loan, rather than withdrawing money from the policy, is that funds continue to earn tax-sheltered income within the policy\u2019s investment account. On the other hand, the interest rate charged on a policy loan may be higher than the return on the funds. Example Joshua had a UL policy that named his daughter Rebecca as the beneficiary. The policy had a $250,000 level death benefit and a cash surrender value of $35,600 when he took a policy loan of $30,000 at an interest rate of 4% annually to help pay for her post-secondary education. By taking the policy loan, Joshua also had to report taxable income of $1,800, according to the information provided by his insurance company. One year later, Joshua died. Assuming he did not make any principal or interest payments on the policy loan, Rebecca would receive a death benefit of $218,800, calculated as ( $250,000 \u2013 $30,000 \u2013 ( $30,000 \u00d7 4%)).","title":"4.6.4 Policy Loans"},{"location":"life/Chapter_4_Universal_Life_Insurance/#465-collateral-for-third-party-loans","text":"The cash value of the investment account can be used as collateral for a loan from a third party, such as a financial institution.

Depending on how the loan is structured, principal and interest payments may not be required. The loan and accumulated interest would be repaid upon the death of the life insured by the death benefit with the residual death benefit going to the beneficiary. Example (cont.) Suppose that instead of taking out a policy loan of $30,000, Joshua had taken a 5-year loan from his local bank at 4% interest, using his UL policy as collateral. At the end of the first year of the loan, Joshua made a repayment of $6,738 to the bank ( $5,538 principal, $1,200 interest). Example (cont.)

The proceeds of the loan are invested according to the policyholder\u2019s financial objectives. Principal and interest payments are not required. The loan plus accumulated accrued interest would be repaid upon the death of the life insured by the death benefit with the residual death benefit going to the beneficiary. If the loan in invested to produce property income, the interest that accrues against the loan is tax deductible by the policyholder. Using the CSV as collateral avoids any tax liability that might occur if the policyholder took a policy loan or made a withdrawal from the policy. Vital to the success of this strategy is that investment returns must be greater than the cost of borrowing. If the loan plus accrued interest exceeds the cash surrender value, the lender may demand repayment of the loan. Leveraging can be a dangerous strategy if investment returns are lower than anticipated. The policyholder may have to surrender the insurance policy if personal funds are not available to make the repayment. The forced surrender of the policy may result in a potential tax liability. Example Wendy has a UL policy with a $500,000 death benefit and a CSV of $260,000. She retired at 55, earlier than anticipated, and thinks she may need to draw on her UL policy to support her retirement income until her CPP and OAS benefits start. However, if she simply withdraws the money from the policy, it will result in taxable income. Instead, she approached a bank about receiving a loan of $10,000 each year for 10 years, using her UL policy as collateral. She will receive the loan proceeds tax-free, resulting in greater after-tax income than if she had withdrawn $10,000 from the policy each year. Wendy will need to monitor the investment returns earned within the policy, to ensure that the loans and ongoing mortality and expense deductions do not reduce the policy\u2019s cash surrender value to the point where it is less than the outstanding loans plus accrued interest.","title":"4.6.6 Leveraging"},{"location":"life/Chapter_4_Universal_Life_Insurance/#467-distribution-upon-death","text":"The amount paid as the death benefit for each of the death benefit options are as follows: Under the level death benefit option : The insurance company usually only pays out the face amount, although some policies will pay out the value of the investment account that exceeds the policy\u2019s face amount.

Paid-up additions (PUA) rider; Term insurance riders; Accidental death rider; and Guaranteed insurability rider. 5.1.1 Paid-up additions (PUA) rider \u00b6 PUAs were introduced in Chapter 2 in regard to participating whole life insurance and its dividend options. The PUA rider gives the policyholder the ability to pay an additional lump sum premium to purchase a small paid-up permanent life insurance policy. In return, he receives the death benefit provided by the PUA and an increased cash surrender value. It can be purchased by whole life or universal life policyholders. PUA rider is underwritten as the same time as the base policy. No additional evidence of insurability is required. The PUAs themselves are restricted: To a specified minimum purchase at any one time; For example, the minimum PUA that could be bought might be $500. To a specified maximum number in any year; For example, a maximum of two could be bought in any year. To a policy lifetime maximum; For example, the total number of PUAs over the life of the policy that could be bought is 10. To a purchase date; For example, purchases can be made on the policy anniversary. By the maximum age of the life insured. For example, PUAs could not be purchased when the life insured is older than 70. There is never a requirement for the policyholder who has added a PUA rider to his policy to buy a PUA. But, if he does not do so, he cannot carry forward unused PUA purchase rights to future years. Riders and Supplementary Benefits Why add the PUA rider? The policyholder is able to increase the death benefit and cash surrender value of his policy with each PUA. Such a rider is beneficial for individuals who expect that their insurance need will increase over time; and The additional insurance is permanent. It will be paid on the death of the life insured. Example Valerie is a business professional and she is the main income earner for her family. She expects her salary to increase at a rate of 5% per year. She has a $500,000 whole life insurance policy with a PUA rider. Under this rider, she is permitted to buy additional coverage of $10,000 per year for the next 20 years, without proving her insurability, by making lump-sum payments. She likes this option because she can increase her coverage as her salary increases. She is not required to purchase the additional coverage in any one year, but if she does not do so, she cannot carry that purchase forward (i.e., she cannot purchase $20,000 of coverage in the following year). 5.1.2 Term Insurance Riders \u00b6 A term rider adds additional insurance coverage to an insurance policy for a limited period of time. The death benefit of a policy with a term rider is the death benefit of the policy plus the death benefit of the rider during the specific time period. There are four types of term insurance riders discussed below. Each one increases the death benefit on a term or permanent life policy for a specific period of time. The death benefit of the rider may be the same as the base policy or larger. The life insured in the rider may be the same life insured in the base policy or another person. Each life insured by the term rider is underwritten separately since each has its own risk of death. A term insurance rider cannot have a term that exceeds the term of the base policy (underlying policy). Once the base policy expires, so does the rider. If this is a concern, the insurer should look for a rider with a conversion option. This option converts the rider to a stand-alone policy without the need to prove insurability. Note that this is different from the conversion option on a term policy, which converts term insurance to permanent insurance. Benefits of adding a term rider: Efficiency - Cover multiple lives with a single policy. It saves money for the policyholder since he is only charged one premium fee for the single policy instead of a premium fee for every policy he acquires; Convenience - Adding a term rider that covers a life insured or lives insured other than the individual who is the life insured in the base policy is convenient for the policyholder since he only needs to keep track of premiums for a single policy. There are several variations of term insurance riders, as discussed in the subsequent pages. 5.1.2.1 On a Term Policy \u00b6 When a term rider is added to a term policy, the term of the rider cannot be longer than the term of the base policy. When the base policy expires, the rider expires. For example, both a 5-year term policy and its term rider terminate at the end of five years. The primary reasons for covering these additional people with a rider are convenience and cost. The policy fee is usually a fixed sum regardless of the amount of coverage provided or the addition of riders. 5.1.2.2 On a Permanent Policy \u00b6 The term rider added to a permanent policy can accommodate short-term needs while the permanent (base) policy provides lifetime coverage. For example, the death benefit of a permanent policy might be needed for estate costs of a life insured but his mortgage will be eliminated in ten years. Therefore, the term rider would be for ten years. Why add a term rider to a permanent policy? The premium for the permanent policy plus term rider will be lower than if the permanent policy death benefit covered the entire sum needed. For example, a permanent policy with a $200,000 face amount and a $200,000-term rider has a lower premium cost than a permanent policy with a $400,000 face amount. The policyholder only has to pay an administrative fee for one policy as opposed to having a number of individual policies each charging an administration fee. Example Zoltan is a business owner and he hopes to pass his business on to his children when he dies, but he expects that a tax liability of $500,000 will result at death. He also has a $200,000 mortgage with 10 years remaining that he would like to have paid off if he dies. The insurance need with respect to the mortgage has a specific duration (10 years) that could be covered with term insurance. The insurance need with respect to the business shares has no defined time limit, so permanent insurance might be appropriate. Zoltan could cover both needs by acquiring a $500,000 whole life insurance policy with a 10-year $200,000-term insurance rider. This would be more cost-effective than paying for a $700,000 whole life insurance policy. 5.1.2.3 Family Coverage Rider \u00b6 Family coverage provides life insurance for a spouse and children. It is available in units; a higher unit value is provided for the spouse than the children. The number of units available for purchase is limited to a coverage amount sufficient to offset the funeral and burial costs upon the death of a spouse or child. Insurance for the spouse is based on his or her attained age at the time the rider is issued and expires at a specified age, such as age 65. The rider automatically covers children when they reach 15 days of age after birth or are adopted. There is no limit on the number of children covered and no increase in premium as a result of the additional children added. Coverage ends at a specified age, such as age 21. Example (cont.) Valerie\u2019s husband, Robert, is a stay-at-home father, taking care of their two-year-old twins, Rebecca and Charlotte. Valerie is currently seven months pregnant, but she intends to return to work four months after giving birth. Robert\u2019s role as a caregiver is essential to the financial health of the family, particularly until the children are in school full-time, so Valerie added a family coverage rider to her whole life policy, for $100,000 of term coverage on Robert, and $20,000 of coverage on each of Rebecca and Charlotte. When their son is born in a few months, he will automatically be covered for $20,000 under the rider once he reaches 15 days old, and Valerie\u2019s premium will not increase. 5.1.2.4 Child Coverage Rider \u00b6 A child coverage rider excludes the spouse. Like coverage in the family coverage rider, insurance begins when a child reaches 15 days of age and expires at a specified age, such as age 21. There is a maximum coverage amount. 5.1.2.5 Converting Child or Family Coverage Riders \u00b6 Why add either of these riders? Conversion allows coverage in a rider to be converted to a permanent stand-alone policy for: The spouse covered by a family coverage rider; Coverage in the policy may be limited to the coverage of the rider. A child covered by either family coverage or child coverage. The child does not have to provide proof of insurability; Coverage provided by the permanent policy may be up to five times that of the rider. Example (cont.) The family coverage rider on Valerie\u2019s policy will cover each child until age 25, and it gives each child the right to convert the term coverage to a whole life policy with a face amount of up to five times the term coverage, or $100,000, without providing proof of insurability. Rebecca has a congenital heart defect that increases her risk of premature death. As long as Rebecca acts before the term insurance coverage expires at age 25, she can still obtain $100,000 of whole life coverage even though she may otherwise be uninsurable. 5.1.3 Accidental Death (AD) Rider \u00b6 An accidental death rider increases the death benefit when death occurs as a result of an accident: An accident is an unexpected event that causes death; Death that occurs from a sudden illness is not considered an accident; Death must occur within a specified period of time after the accident, such as one year. The rider is offered in units (like the family coverage rider) or as a multiple of the death benefit. Two times the death benefit is the common amount of coverage, as a result this rider is sometimes called the \u201cdouble indemnity.\u201d The rider has age limitations, even though the base policy is not subject to the same limitation: Applications may have to be made before a specified age (such as 55); The rider may terminate on a specified age; The coverage may reduce at a specified age. An accident is considered to be an unexpected violent or traumatic event. Death resulting from suicide, self-injuries, war or the commission of a crime is typically excluded from the AD rider. AD benefits are usually packaged with accidental dismemberment benefits and sold as an accidental death and dismemberment rider (AD&D). Example Janet had a $250,000 whole life insurance policy with a rider that doubles her death benefit for accidental death. She was found dead at the wheel of her car after it struck a concrete bridge. Her autopsy showed that she suffered a mild heart attack, which likely contributed to the accident, but that ultimately she died as a result of injuries sustained in the crash. Janet\u2019s beneficiary will receive death benefit proceeds of $500,000. However, if the autopsy had shown that Janet had died instantly from a massive coronary event, her beneficiary would likely only receive the original $250,000 death benefit. 5.1.4 Guaranteed Insurability Benefit (GIB) Rider \u00b6 The GIB rider provides an option to increase coverage in the future without having to prove insurability. It is very useful for those who currently: Do not have a large insurance need; or Cannot afford a larger amount of insurance, but expect they will want to increase their coverage in the future. It is available for both term and permanent policies. Premiums are based on the attained age of the life insured when the rider is exercised. The rider has the following limitations: Time: Must be used at specified times; May be used only to a specified age; May be used a specified number of times. Amount of increase: Each increase is limited; Total increase is limited; Limit is set as a percentage of face amount. Why add the GIB rider? A policyholder with this rider is guaranteed the right to increase coverage on the life insured regardless of his health. Example Doug recently got engaged, and he and his fianc\u00e9e Noma plan to have several children. Doug is only 25 and his cash flow is tight, but he knows that he will need a fair amount of insurance protection once they start their family. He purchased a 10-year $300,000-term policy now, along with a GIB rider that will allow him to increase his coverage by up to $20,000 each year. 5.2 Supplementary Benefits \u00b6 The following are supplementary benefits (also called living benefits); they are received while the life insured is still living and may or may not affect the death benefit paid upon death of the insured: Accelerated death benefits; Accidental dismemberment benefit; Waiver of premium for total disability benefit; Parent/payor waiver benefit. 5.2.1 Accelerated Death Benefits \u00b6 When accelerated death benefits are added to a life insurance policy, the insurance company will pay out a portion of the death benefit prior to death of the life insured, if certain conditions are met. Accelerated death benefits are sometimes also referred to as living benefits. There are two types of accelerated death benefits, discussed below. 5.2.1.1 Terminal Illness (TI) Benefit \u00b6 A policyholder may receive a specified amount of a policy\u2019s death benefit in advance when the life insured is diagnosed with an illness that will result in death: The amount advanced is a percentage of the face amount to a dollar limit; Death must be expected to occur death within a certain period of time, such as one year. The request must be supported by a qualified physician. The benefit is often automatically included in a policy or is sometimes extended on compassionate grounds. In such cases, it carries no extra premium. The TI benefit is usually restricted to a maximum amount\u2014a percentage of the original face amount (i.e., up to 75% or a dollar amount). The amount received by the policyholder is tax-free. The death benefit is reduced depending on how the advance has been structured by the insurance company: The death benefit is reduced by the amount already paid in the benefit; or The advance is treated as a loan. The death benefit is reduced by the loan and interest charged on the loan. The TI benefit is payable to the policyholder regardless of the named beneficiary. If the beneficiary designation is irrevocable, then the policyholder will need to obtain the authorization of the beneficiary. Example William has a $500,000-term life insurance policy on his own life, with his wife, Alyssa, named as the revocable beneficiary. He bought the policy to help Alyssa maintain the family\u2019s standard of living if he died prematurely and the family no longer received his employment income. The policy provides for a terminal illness benefit of up to 25% of the death benefit, to a maximum of $100,000. Unfortunately, William was recently diagnosed with a terminal form of cancer and he is no longer able to work. His oncologist has told him that he will likely die within 6 to 12 months. Alyssa has reduced her work hours to help care for William and to spend more time with him. To help compensate for their loss of income, William applied for, and received, a non-taxable terminal illness benefit of $100,000. When he dies, Alyssa will receive a death benefit of $400,000, which is the original face amount of $500,000 minus the TI benefit of $100,000. 5.2.1.2 Dread Disease (DD) Benefit (a.k.a. Critical Illness or CI Benefit) \u00b6 The dread disease (DD) benefit allows the policyholder to receive a benefit if the life insured is diagnosed with one of the conditions specified by the contract. The life insured does not have to be in danger of dying as a result of the condition, but the diagnosis must be supported by a qualified physician. The conditions covered will vary with the insurance company and contract. Policyholders should be clear about which health conditions are covered and which are not. Although the number of covered conditions may be as high as 25 or even more, most policies cover the \u201cBig 4\u201d (heart attack, stroke, coronary bypass surgery; and life-threatening cancer). It is important that the policyholder reviews each policy carefully and understands what is covered in the policy. The life insured must live for a period of time following diagnosis (such as 30 days) for the benefit to be paid. It is paid as a tax-free lump sum. Because it is an acceleration of the death benefit, it is not taxable. Example Scott has a $500,000 whole life insurance policy that includes a $100,000 dread disease benefit. He recently suffered a stroke that has left him almost fully paralyzed. Provided that he survives at least 30 days following the stroke, he can apply to receive the DD benefit of $100,000. The conditions covered under a DD benefit are similar to those covered under an individual critical illness (CI) insurance policy. For this reason, a DD benefit is sometimes called a critical illness benefit. Why add the DD benefit to a policy? This CI-like coverage may allow the policyholder to save money compared to buying separate life and CI policies. If a life insurance policy uses the term \u201ccritical illness benefit\u201d or \u201ccritical illness rider,\u201d the policyholder should read the terms of coverage carefully: If the amount paid out when the insured suffers a covered condition reduces the death benefit, the policy is offering an accelerated death benefit, in the form of a dread disease (DD) benefit. If the amount paid out when the insured suffers a covered condition does not affect the death benefit (i.e., it is paid in addition to the death benefit), it is likely a critical illness rider for which an additional premium must be paid. 5.2.2 Accidental Dismemberment Benefit \u00b6 The accidental dismemberment benefit is usually combined with the accidental death (AD) rider (Section 5.1.3) to form the accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) rider. This benefit requires an accident to occur, in this case, the accident must cause the loss of a body part or body function. A schedule specifies what percentage of the death benefit is paid for specific losses. For example, loss of sight in one eye might pay 50% of the death benefit. The loss must occur within a certain time following the accident, such as one year. The maximum amount payable for any one accident or event is limited to 100% of the death benefit. Losses incurred via self-inflicted injuries, war or the commission of a crime are generally excluded. *The maximum payable for any one accident or event is limited to 100% of the death benefit. 5.2.3 Waiver of Premium for Total Disability Benefit \u00b6 This waiver stops the insurance company from charging premiums when the life insured is totally disabled. The policy and all the benefits under the policy will remain in force. The policy will define what constitutes total disability. The definition of total disability can vary widely between insurers. While premiums are being waived, benefits continue to accrue under the policy. Thus, dividends will continue to be paid (if it is a participating policy), cash values may continue to grow, and all riders and supplementary benefits remain in force. 5.2.3.1 Waiting Period \u00b6 The policy will specify the waiting period between when total disability occurs and the start of the waiver. 5.2.3.2 Renewable or Convertible Term Policies \u00b6 The waiver will continue if a term policy is renewed or converted. 5.2.4 Parent/Payor Waiver Benefit \u00b6 The parent waiver benefit is used when the life insured is the child of the policyholder. The payor waiver benefit is used when the life insured is anyone other than a child of the policyholder. Both benefits can waive premiums if the policyholder is totally disabled or dies. Proof of insurability must be provided for the policyholder and life insured. When a child is the life insured, premiums may be waived to a specified age, such as age 21. Example Anwar is the primary income earner in his family; his wife Anya currently cares for their three children, who are all under the age of five. He has a $1,000,000 whole life insurance policy on his own life. He also has a $300,000-term life insurance policy on Anya\u2019s life because he knows that he would have to hire someone to care for their children if she were to die. He is the policyholder. He has added a waiver of premium for total disability benefit to the policy on his own life, and a payor waiver benefit to the policy on Anya\u2019s life, to ensure that both policies will remain in place if he becomes totally disabled. 5.3 Using Riders and Supplementary Benefits to Customize Coverage \u00b6 A policyholder can add riders and supplementary benefits to his base insurance policy to customize or enhance the coverage. This section explores some of the things a policyholder should consider when determining if these extras are appropriate for him. 5.3.1 Cost of Coverage \u00b6 Premiums for the base policy will reflect additional costs for the addition of riders and benefits. 5.3.2 Value of Coverage \u00b6 The policyholder or beneficiary must need the insurance acquired via the rider or benefit for it to add value to the base policy. Riders and benefits are a way to structure coverage (and reduce premiums) in the base policy while maintaining the same total insurance coverage. For example, a permanent policy for $500,000 with a term rider of $500,000 provides $1 million in total coverage at a much lower cost than $1 million of permanent insurance. 5.3.2.1 Limitations \u00b6 Note the restrictions in many of the riders and what conditions or circumstances trigger payment of benefits, such as the many limitations applied to PUA purchases. 5.3.2.2 Exclusions \u00b6 Certain events may exclude payment of the rider or benefit, such as a health condition not covered in the critical illness benefit. The policyholder should also be aware of those conditions under which payments would not be made under a rider or supplementary benefit. 5.3.3 Differences Between Companies \u00b6 Riders and benefits offered very differently by different insurers. Policyholders must not assume that the product provided by one insurer will be the same when another insurer provides it. The benefit may be better or worse. However, the death benefit provided by life insurance operates the same way across insurance companies. If the life insured dies, the death benefit is paid (less any outstanding policy loans). Example Elias decided to take Company A\u2019s insurance policy because the waiting period imposed for the waiver of premium benefit is three months and not six months as imposed by some other insurance companies. Example (cont.) Jackson would like to obtain the maximum dread disease (DD) benefit possible. He compares Companies A and B. He decides on Company B because it provides a DD benefit of 50% of the face amount as opposed to 25% provided by Company A. For family history reasons, it is very important for Cindy to find a DD benefit that covers Alzheimer\u2019s. Company B does not but she is happy to see that Company A does. 5.4 Advantages and Disadvantages of Riders and Supplementary Benefits \u00b6 The advantages and disadvantages of riders and supplementary benefits are summarized in Table 5.2.","title":"Chapter 5 Riders and Supplementary Benefits"},{"location":"life/Chapter_5_Riders_and_Supplementary_Benefits/#chapter-5-riders-and-supplementary-benefits","text":"","title":"Chapter 5: Riders and Supplementary Benefits"},{"location":"life/Chapter_5_Riders_and_Supplementary_Benefits/#51-riders-that-provide-additional-benefits-upon-death","text":"The following riders increase the death benefit.

The PUA rider gives the policyholder the ability to pay an additional lump sum premium to purchase a small paid-up permanent life insurance policy. In return, he receives the death benefit provided by the PUA and an increased cash surrender value. It can be purchased by whole life or universal life policyholders. PUA rider is underwritten as the same time as the base policy. No additional evidence of insurability is required. The PUAs themselves are restricted: To a specified minimum purchase at any one time; For example, the minimum PUA that could be bought might be $500. To a specified maximum number in any year; For example, a maximum of two could be bought in any year. To a policy lifetime maximum; For example, the total number of PUAs over the life of the policy that could be bought is 10. To a purchase date; For example, purchases can be made on the policy anniversary. By the maximum age of the life insured. For example, PUAs could not be purchased when the life insured is older than 70. There is never a requirement for the policyholder who has added a PUA rider to his policy to buy a PUA. But, if he does not do so, he cannot carry forward unused PUA purchase rights to future years. Riders and Supplementary Benefits Why add the PUA rider? The policyholder is able to increase the death benefit and cash surrender value of his policy with each PUA. Such a rider is beneficial for individuals who expect that their insurance need will increase over time; and The additional insurance is permanent. It will be paid on the death of the life insured. Example Valerie is a business professional and she is the main income earner for her family. She expects her salary to increase at a rate of 5% per year. She has a $500,000 whole life insurance policy with a PUA rider. Under this rider, she is permitted to buy additional coverage of $10,000 per year for the next 20 years, without proving her insurability, by making lump-sum payments. She likes this option because she can increase her coverage as her salary increases. She is not required to purchase the additional coverage in any one year, but if she does not do so, she cannot carry that purchase forward (i.e., she cannot purchase $20,000 of coverage in the following year).","title":"5.1.1 Paid-up additions (PUA) rider"},{"location":"life/Chapter_5_Riders_and_Supplementary_Benefits/#512-term-insurance-riders","text":"A term rider adds additional insurance coverage to an insurance policy for a limited period of time. The death benefit of a policy with a term rider is the death benefit of the policy plus the death benefit of the rider during the specific time period. There are four types of term insurance riders discussed below. Each one increases the death benefit on a term or permanent life policy for a specific period of time. The death benefit of the rider may be the same as the base policy or larger. The life insured in the rider may be the same life insured in the base policy or another person. Each life insured by the term rider is underwritten separately since each has its own risk of death. A term insurance rider cannot have a term that exceeds the term of the base policy (underlying policy). Once the base policy expires, so does the rider. If this is a concern, the insurer should look for a rider with a conversion option. This option converts the rider to a stand-alone policy without the need to prove insurability. Note that this is different from the conversion option on a term policy, which converts term insurance to permanent insurance. Benefits of adding a term rider: Efficiency - Cover multiple lives with a single policy. It saves money for the policyholder since he is only charged one premium fee for the single policy instead of a premium fee for every policy he acquires; Convenience - Adding a term rider that covers a life insured or lives insured other than the individual who is the life insured in the base policy is convenient for the policyholder since he only needs to keep track of premiums for a single policy. There are several variations of term insurance riders, as discussed in the subsequent pages.","title":"5.1.2 Term Insurance Riders"},{"location":"life/Chapter_5_Riders_and_Supplementary_Benefits/#5121-on-a-term-policy","text":"When a term rider is added to a term policy, the term of the rider cannot be longer than the term of the base policy. When the base policy expires, the rider expires. For example, both a 5-year term policy and its term rider terminate at the end of five years. The primary reasons for covering these additional people with a rider are convenience and cost. The policy fee is usually a fixed sum regardless of the amount of coverage provided or the addition of riders.","title":"5.1.2.1 On a Term Policy"},{"location":"life/Chapter_5_Riders_and_Supplementary_Benefits/#5122-on-a-permanent-policy","text":"The term rider added to a permanent policy can accommodate short-term needs while the permanent (base) policy provides lifetime coverage. For example, the death benefit of a permanent policy might be needed for estate costs of a life insured but his mortgage will be eliminated in ten years. Therefore, the term rider would be for ten years. Why add a term rider to a permanent policy? The premium for the permanent policy plus term rider will be lower than if the permanent policy death benefit covered the entire sum needed. For example, a permanent policy with a $200,000 face amount and a $200,000-term rider has a lower premium cost than a permanent policy with a $400,000 face amount. The policyholder only has to pay an administrative fee for one policy as opposed to having a number of individual policies each charging an administration fee. Example Zoltan is a business owner and he hopes to pass his business on to his children when he dies, but he expects that a tax liability of $500,000 will result at death. He also has a $200,000 mortgage with 10 years remaining that he would like to have paid off if he dies. The insurance need with respect to the mortgage has a specific duration (10 years) that could be covered with term insurance. The insurance need with respect to the business shares has no defined time limit, so permanent insurance might be appropriate. Zoltan could cover both needs by acquiring a $500,000 whole life insurance policy with a 10-year $200,000-term insurance rider. This would be more cost-effective than paying for a $700,000 whole life insurance policy.","title":"5.1.2.2 On a Permanent Policy"},{"location":"life/Chapter_5_Riders_and_Supplementary_Benefits/#5123-family-coverage-rider","text":"Family coverage provides life insurance for a spouse and children. It is available in units; a higher unit value is provided for the spouse than the children.

Insurance for the spouse is based on his or her attained age at the time the rider is issued and expires at a specified age, such as age 65. The rider automatically covers children when they reach 15 days of age after birth or are adopted. There is no limit on the number of children covered and no increase in premium as a result of the additional children added. Coverage ends at a specified age, such as age 21. Example (cont.) Valerie\u2019s husband, Robert, is a stay-at-home father, taking care of their two-year-old twins, Rebecca and Charlotte. Valerie is currently seven months pregnant, but she intends to return to work four months after giving birth. Robert\u2019s role as a caregiver is essential to the financial health of the family, particularly until the children are in school full-time, so Valerie added a family coverage rider to her whole life policy, for $100,000 of term coverage on Robert, and $20,000 of coverage on each of Rebecca and Charlotte.

AD benefits are usually packaged with accidental dismemberment benefits and sold as an accidental death and dismemberment rider (AD&D). Example Janet had a $250,000 whole life insurance policy with a rider that doubles her death benefit for accidental death.

The other benefits provided by group insurance is covered under the Accident & Sickness module. Group insurance is insurance that is offered by a plan sponsor to a group of people who share a common association with the plan sponsor. For example, employees working for the same company. The policyholder (the company) is called the plan sponsor; the common association is that all the employees work for the company; and the employees are the life (lives) insured. 6.1.1 What Constitutes a Group \u00b6 Group insurance can be made available to groups such as: Employees of a certain employer (the employer must have more than the minimum number of employees as set by the insurer issuing the policy - usually 5 employees minimum); Students or alumni of a specific university or college; Professional association members, such as members of The College of Physicians and Surgeons; Society members such as members of The Society of Automotive Engineers. Example Helen is a university graduate with an engineering degree, and she is registered as a professional engineer with an occupational association. She is self-employed as a consultant and is a member of her local Chamber of Commerce. She has also purchased memberships with two retail associations. Because she is self-employed, she cannot obtain life insurance through her employer. 6.1.2 Policyholder \u00b6 The policyholder is also called the plan sponsor. A plan sponsor can be almost any organization, society, or association that enters into a contract with an insurance company to provide life insurance coverage to the members of its group. Plan sponsors divide its group into subgroups called membership classes. Each class receives insurance coverage appropriate to its needs. For example, within a company, executives may receive higher coverage reflecting their higher levels of income than the coverage received by its factory workers. 6.1.3 Master Contract \u00b6 A policy is issued by the life insurance company to the plan sponsor as a master contract. Group Life Insurance The plan sponsor is the owner/manager of the policy for its members. It is responsible for paying premiums, and making decisions regarding the policy. The master contract insures the sponsor\u2019s employees or members. They are called the group plan members. Members have no direct contact with the insurance company. They also have no control over the policy aside from naming the beneficiary and buying optional additional coverage if the plan permits. Group members do not receive a copy of the master contract. They receive a benefit booklet that summarizes all the insurance benefits and rights under the contract. 6.1.4 Group Membership \u00b6 The plan sponsor establishes eligibility for membership in the group plan. To obtain coverage under the group plan, the plan member must meet the criteria of eligibility that define the group. There are three types of membership in a group plan: Optional membership for association members. The member chooses to join; Members must be a current association member in good standing; Members who leave the association may be able to convert their policies to another form of insurance that will be personally owned. Optional membership for employees. The employee chooses to join and is required to pay a portion of the cost of insurance; This is called a contributory plan because the member contributes towards the premium; An employee can enroll in the plan after satisfying the group\u2019s probation period. The probationary period, also called the waiting period, is the length of time an employee must work with an employer before becoming eligible for group insurance coverage (usually three months); Upon becoming eligible, an employee has a limited amount of time to enroll in the group plan and obtain life insurance coverage without providing any evidence of insurability. This is referred to as the enrollment period. Mandatory membership for employees. The employee is eligible for enrollment in the group plan after satisfying the probationary period. 6.1.4.1 Actively-at-Work Requirement \u00b6 When the sponsor is an employer, the employee must be at work on the day his coverage in the group plan is to begin. If the employee is away from work on the scheduled day, his coverage will not begin until the employee returns to work. 6.1.4.2 Membership Classes \u00b6 Some employer-sponsored plans have more than one membership class within a single group plan. Labour, clerical/administration, and management are examples of the different classes that may exist in a group plan. A schedule of benefits (See Section 6.2.1) applies to each member of a membership class. Membership classes differ from one another in their coverage. Example The DEF Company, manufacturer of kitchen cupboards, sponsors a group insurance plan for its employees. The plan provides a death benefit equal to one times salary for all full-time factory floor employees, and two times salary for all salaried managerial staff. 6.1.5 Premiums \u00b6 Premiums for group life insurance are based on the average characteristics of the group. Individuals are not singled out. For example, if the life insurance company charges $0.20 for insurance, that rate will apply to everyone in the group regardless of age, gender or health. The insurance company recalculates the premium every year. Changes are made to reflect changes in the group\u2019s demographics. For example, due to an increasingly older or younger workforce premiums will change. Most plans require the employer to cover at least 50% of the premiums. An employer may pay the full amount if they choose. For contributory plans, the employer pays the full premium to the insurance company and then deducts the employees\u2019 contributions directly from their pay. 6.1.5.1 Tax Treatment for Employer \u00b6 Premiums paid by the employer are deductible as a business expense. 6.1.5.2 Tax Treatment for Employee \u00b6 Premiums paid by an employer on behalf of a group member are a taxable benefit to the employee. Premiums paid by the employee are not tax deductible. Death benefits paid by the policy are tax-free. Example Aimee is a member of her employer\u2019s group life insurance plan. The annual premiums for Aimee\u2019s participation in the plan amount to $500, and the employer pays 60% of these premiums, or $300. This results in a taxable benefit of $300 for Aimee, which will be added to her annual income. The employer also deducts $200 from her pay to cover her share of the premiums. 6.1.5.3 Sales Tax on Premiums \u00b6 A tax on premiums is charged by the provinces/territories the same as it is for personal policies. The tax ranges from 2% to 5% depending on the province. Retail sales tax is also charged on premiums in Manitoba (7%), Ontario (8%) and Qu\u00e9bec (9.975%). GST/HST is charged on administrative fees. 6.2 Group Term Insurance Coverage \u00b6 Insurance coverage is restricted by the terms of the plan. A prescribed amount of base coverage is automatically provided to all members. Some plans provide members with the option to purchase additional coverage. Insurance is usually provided in the form of yearly renewable term. 6.2.1 Schedule of Benefits \u00b6 The schedule of benefits describes the amount of coverage provided as the \u201cbase.\u201d If a plan has different membership classes, then a different schedule of benefits will apply to each class. Coverage can be increased by one of the following four methods. 6.2.1.1 Earnings Multiple \u00b6 Earnings multiple coverage uses the group member\u2019s base salary as a starting point and adds a multiple of that base or a portion of that base. For example, the CEO may receive coverage equal to twice her salary. The plan may specify a maximum coverage amount. 6.2.1.2 Flat Rate \u00b6 A flat rate coverage, every ground member receives the same dollar amount of insurance regardless of position or salary. 6.2.1.3 Length of Service \u00b6 Under the length of service schedule, coverage increases the longer the group member works. 6.2.1.4 Combination \u00b6 Combination improves benefits by membership class: Employees on salary receive earnings multiple; Hourly-wage employees receive a flat rate. 6.2.2 Coverage Maximums \u00b6 Most plans place a cap on the amount of coverage, so that no single member receives more than a maximum amount of coverage. 6.2.3 Reductions for Older or Retired Group Members \u00b6 A plan may reduce coverage for older or retired group members to control premium cost for the balance of the group. Remember, the coverage provided is yearly renewable term. Therefore, YRT costs for older members will be much higher than for those who are younger. Their higher cost can increase premium costs for all group members. The amount of coverage older/retired workers receive may be reduced to: A percentage of pre-retirement coverage; or A dollar amount; or A gradual decline every year until a minimum amount of coverage is reached. Example Carl is a member of his employer\u2019s group life insurance plan, which provides a base benefit of $100,000. He plans to retire next year, when he turns 60 years old. At that time, his coverage will drop to 50% of the base coverage. At age 65 it will drop to 25% of the base coverage, and at age 70 coverage ceases completely. 6.2.4 Optional Additional Coverage \u00b6 Some plans allow their members to add coverage to their base coverage. The additional insurance is an option, not a requirement. The plan member pays premiums for the additional coverage. The plan member must be enrolled in the group\u2019s base plan in order to purchase additional coverage. Proof of insurability is usually required. The proof of insurability reduces adverse selection. Adverse selection occurs when those who have a higher probability of death (that is, those who are bad risks) choose to receive a higher amount of coverage if it is made available to them. If insurance was issued to those who would otherwise not qualify, their correspondingly higher rate of death would increase premiums cost for the group as a whole. Proof of insurability is sometimes not required. In such cases, the additional coverage can only be purchased within a specific period of time. For example, optional coverage can be purchased up to 60 days after the waiting period without proof of insurability. Plan members must pay 100% of the premium for any optional life insurance coverage purchased. 6.2.4.1 Term Coverage \u00b6 Additional coverage that is provided is term life insurance. It is sold in units and members can buy as many additional units as desired, up to a maximum. For example, one unit could be worth $25,000. Spouses may also be covered with the same coverage units and maximums. There are a maximum number of units that can be purchased by the plan member and his spouse. Why add additional coverage? Additional units of insurance are typically less expensive than buying a personal policy for the same amount. Example Mario is 55 years old and he recently started a new job. He was automatically enrolled in the company\u2019s group life insurance plan last week, which covers him for $75,000. He just took out a new mortgage for $200,000, and he would like to add $200,000 of life insurance to cover this debt if he dies. Because of health issues, individual insurance would be very expensive, assuming he could even get coverage. However, his group life insurance plan allows members to buy up to 10 units of additional term insurance coverage, where each unit is $25,000. As long as they apply for this coverage within 60 days of joining the plan, no evidence of insurability is required. Mario can take advantage of the group life insurance plan to get the coverage he needs at a more affordable cost. 6.2.4.2 Permanent Coverage \u00b6 Permanent insurance is sometimes offered instead of term insurance as additional coverage, but this is rare. This is more commonly an option for policy conversion. 6.3 Dependant Life Coverage \u00b6 Dependants\u2014that is, the spouse and children\u2014may be covered without proof of insurability if the plan member applies for their insurance within a short period of time after joining the plan. Upon a change in marital status, coverage can be obtained for a dependant without proof of insurability, again within a specified time period. Premiums for dependant coverage tend to be higher than premiums for single life coverage. This is due to higher risk associated with adverse selection\u2014dependants in poor health who may otherwise be uninsurable may take advantage of the dependant coverage. 6.3.1 Definition of Dependant \u00b6 Who is a dependant? A spouse\u2014legal, common law, opposite sex or same sex; Children who are financially dependent. The oldest age that may be covered is 18, 19, or 21. Extended coverage, up to age 25, is available if the child is in school. Coverage begins 15 days following birth; Disabled children may be covered indefinitely. Example Chuck and Paul both work at the same company, and they are both covered for $200,000 under their employer\u2019s group life insurance plan. Chuck is married, but he and his wife do not have any children. Paul has a wife and two young children, and they expect a third child in a few months. Chuck and Paul both opted to buy the optional dependant coverage offered by their group plan. Despite the difference in the number of their dependants, Chuck and Paul will pay the same premiums. Also, Paul\u2019s newborn will automatically be covered under the plan after reaching 14 days of age. 6.3.2 Death Benefit Amount \u00b6 The death benefit under dependant life coverage is quite modest compared to the coverage on the member\u2019s own life or the optional spousal coverage available under some plans. While the actual amount will vary with the policy, dependant coverage is usually in the range of $5,000 to $20,000 on the spouse\u2019s life, with 50% of this amount on the life of each dependent child. 6.3.3 Premiums \u00b6 Each group plan member with dependant life coverage pays the same premium regardless of the number of dependants. Some group plans require separate payment for each dependant. Coverage is very low cost (i.e., coverage of $10,000 for all children may cost $2 per month). 6.4 Survivor Income Benefits \u00b6 Some group plans provide the option for the survivor of a group plan member to receive a monthly income benefit. The amount paid is a percentage of the plan member\u2019s monthly salary before death. This is normally an optional benefit that can be purchased by the plan member. For example, Richard was a group plan member with AAA Industries. When he died, his wife received the death benefit from the AAA group policy. She will continue to receive a monthly benefit equal to 25% of Richard\u2019s monthly salary. 6.4.1 Beneficiaries \u00b6 The survivor income benefit can be paid to the spouse or, sometimes, the children. The spouse receives the benefit until age 65, remarriage, or death; The children receive the benefit to a set age, such as age 21, or longer if they continue to attend school full time. 6.4.2 Benefit Amount \u00b6 As discussed, the benefit the spouse receives is a percentage of the plan member\u2019s monthly salary before death. There may be a maximum imposed on the amount the survivor can receive each month, year, or cumulatively. Surviving children may receive a higher benefit if both parents have died (i.e., both the plan member and the spouse) and the child has been orphaned as a result of the plan member\u2019s death. Example A group life insurance plan offered by ABC University allows plan members to buy coverage that will pay monthly survival income benefits equal to 25% of the member\u2019s basic monthly earnings to the surviving spouse, plus 5% of basic monthly earnings to each surviving child. 6.5 Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) \u00b6 Group life insurance plans usually offer AD&D as part of the group benefit. Death must result from an accident. The benefit paid is an extra benefit over and above the base benefit. The extra benefit usually equals the basic death benefit. Example Michael has been working with Energy Power for 5 years. He is enrolled in the company group plan which provides group life insurance coverage in the amount of one times his salary of $55,000. The plan also has AD&D coverage. His wife is the named beneficiary. While on vacation he has a skiing accident and dies due to his injuries. As a result, his group plan pays his surviving spouse a death benefit in the amount to $55,000 plus an additional death benefit of $55,000 under the AD portion of the AD&D coverage. Under the dismemberment part of an AD&D plan, the insurance company will pay a lump-sum equal to the basic death benefit or a percentage of the death benefit. It is paid as a lump sum when the plan member loses a body part or body function as a result of an accident. 6.5.1 Basic vs. Voluntary AD&D \u00b6 Basic AD&D is automatic coverage provided to plan members. Voluntary AD&D is optional coverage provided to plan members, often sold in multiples of a specific unit, to a maximum amount. Each unit has the same dollar value, such as $5,000. If the plan member dies as a result of an accident, the calculation for the death benefit is: Death benefit + (number of units \u00d7 value of additional units) Example Maureen\u2019s group life insurance plan provides a death benefit equal to her annual salary of $120,000. It also provided AD&D coverage equal to one times the death benefit. She purchased four units of voluntary AD&D coverage, at $25,000 per unit. If she dies as a result of an accident, her beneficiaries will receive a total of $340,000, calculated as: However, if she dies as a result of an illness, her beneficiaries will only receive $120,000. 6.5.1.1 Coverage for Dependants \u00b6 Coverage for the spouse and children of a plan member is optional. Coverage is a percentage of the coverage on the plan member. Example Charlotte\u2019s group life insurance plan provides a death benefit equal to her annual salary, or $120,000. She also purchased four units of voluntary AD&D coverage, at $25,000 per unit. If she dies as a result of an accident, her beneficiaries will receive a total of $220,000, calculated as: ( $120,000 + (4 \u00d7 $25,000)) = $220,000. However, if she dies as a result of an illness, her beneficiaries will only receive $120,000. 6.5.2 Exclusions \u00b6 Death must be caused by an accident for AD&D benefits to be paid out. Common exclusions to payment of the benefit are injuries that are: Self-inflicted; Caused by war or service in the armed forces; Caused when committing a crime; Caused by impaired driving; Caused by piloting a non-commercial aircraft. 6.5.3 Overall Limits \u00b6 There will be a maximum number of AD&D units of coverage that can be bought (i.e., units of $10,000 up to a maximum of 10 units or $100,000). 6.6 Conversion Privileges \u00b6 Coverage under a group life plan may be converted to a personal policy with the same insurance company if: The plan member leaves the plan due to retirement or change of employer; The group member is no longer a member of the sponsoring organization; The sponsor terminates its plan. Example Derek\u2019s employer is experiencing financial hardship and it has terminated the group plan to cut costs. While Derek may be able to convert his coverage to an individual policy (see the section Conversion privileges), it will still be considerably more expensive than the group insurance coverage, and he will have to pay the premiums himself. 6.6.1 In Qu\u00e9bec \u00b6 The Qu\u00e9bec Act respecting insurance includes specific rules that protect a group member\u2019s rights when he leaves a group life insurance plan, or when the master contract expires or is cancelled. 6.6.1.1 Leaving the Plan (In Qu\u00e9bec) \u00b6 A group life member must be given the option of converting group coverage into personal coverage if the plan member leaves the group before age 65. This also applies to spousal or dependant coverage. The personal coverage is limited to an amount between $10,000 and $400,000. The converted dependant coverage must be $5,000 for each dependant and cannot exceed the amount of insurance on the life of those persons on the conversion date. The group member has 31 days after leaving the group to convert to the personal coverage for himself, his spouse and dependants, without providing evidence of insurability. During this period, the group insurance will remain in effect. The conversion options provided must be: Of comparable coverage; A one-year term with a further conversion option at the end of the year to convert to permanent insurance. 6.6.1.2 Master Contract Terminates (In Qu\u00e9bec) \u00b6 If a master contract expires and is not replaced or if the master contract is replaced with one that provides less insurance coverage, a person who has been a plan member for at least five years can convert some or all of his coverage into a personal policy within 31 days after the master contract expires. The amount of insurance to be carried over to the personal policy must be the greater of $10,000 or 25% of the group plan coverage. 6.6.2 In the Rest of Canada \u00b6 There is no provincial legislation other than in Qu\u00e9bec to specify what happens during conversion of a group plan member to a personal policy. Guidelines are set out by the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association (CLHIA) and have been adopted by the rest of Canada: Conversion of group coverage to personal coverage up to $200,000 should be permitted up to and including age 65, without providing proof of insurability; The plan member should have a minimum of two life insurance choices: Insurance choices are yearly renewable term or term-to-aged 65; The application must be made within 31 days of the end of the group plan. The CLHIA Guidelines do not address conversion privileges for spousal and dependant coverage. In practice, most group insurance plans extend conversion privileges to spousal coverage. Dependant coverage is not convertible. 6.6.3 Premiums Upon Conversion \u00b6 The concept of adverse selection applies to converted policies, that is, those who are most likely to be uninsurable or have a higher risk of dying apply for conversion. This may be because conversion does not require proof of insurability. Therefore, the plan member may receive insurance for which he would not otherwise qualify. This increases the insurance company\u2019s risk. Therefore, premiums may be higher on a converted policy than on a brand-new individual policy. 6.7 Replacement Contracts \u00b6 A sponsor may choose to change group insurance companies (i.e., replace one with another). CLHIA guidelines are designed to ensure that members should not lose coverage as a result of such a change unless they were members of a class that is not covered by the new plan. Also, members should not lose coverage because they were not actively at work at the time of the change. 6.7.1 Benefit Amounts \u00b6 Benefit amounts should not change as a result of a replacement contract, provided that the plan member is eligible under terms of the new contract. However, new maximums may apply. 6.8 Disabled Members \u00b6 A waiver of premium is included for group plan members if a plan member becomes disabled. CLHIA guidelines require that the premium must continue to be waived and coverage continued even if the employer terminates the group contract with the insurance company. 6.9 Group Creditor Insurance \u00b6 A creditor is a person or company owed money by a borrower. Example Big Bank lends money to Homeowner in the form of a mortgage. Big Bank is the creditor. Most financial institutions offer creditor insurance to their customers. Group creditor insurance establishes a financial institution as the policyholder and the people to whom the financial institution lends money as the plan\u2019s group members. Example Big Bank is the policyholder and Homeowner is the group member. To protect borrowers, CLHIA guidelines require the lender to disclose that: The insurance they provide is voluntary and cancellable; After receiving the Certificate of Insurance, the borrower has 20 days to cancel and obtain a full refund; The borrower can cancel at any time; The amount of the premium and how it is calculated; Coverage is subject to acceptance by the insurer; Any and all limitations, restricted or excluded coverage; Terms under which coverage starts if the application is accepted; Any further steps that the borrower has to take. 6.9.1 Death Benefit \u00b6 The death benefit is usually equal to the outstanding loan. Example (cont.) Homeowner has a mortgage of $250,000. Four years later when she dies, the mortgage is $244,000. The death benefit is $244,000. 6.9.2 Beneficiary \u00b6 The beneficiary is the creditor (the lending institution) which uses the proceeds to pay off the debt. Example (cont.) The Homeowner\u2019s death benefit is $244,000. It is paid to Big Bank. 6.9.3 Premiums \u00b6 Underwriting for creditor insurance is not like underwriting for a personal policy. Factors taken into consideration for creditor insurance are age and smoking status. Premiums for: Mortgage life insurance are based on the total amount of the mortgage. It is considered decreasing term insurance because the premiums will never change, even though the balance is declining over time. Example (cont.) Homeowner\u2019s premium would be based on the $250,000 mortgage. Insuring a line of credit is based on the amount of the loan outstanding each month or an annual average. For example, a line of credit has been extended in the sum of $80,000. If $25,000 has been used, the premium is based on the $25,000. 6.9.4 Additional Coverage \u00b6 The creditor group policy may also cover critical illness, disability, and sometimes unemployment. It may be part of the base policy or covered separately. 6.9.4.1 Disability \u00b6 The creditor is paid a monthly benefit upon disability. The amount of the benefit is the lesser of based on the monthly loan payment or a specified amount. Example (cont.) Big Bank has provided all forms of additional coverage on Homeowner. If she becomes disabled and cannot work, Big Bank is paid the equivalent of Homeowner\u2019s monthly mortgage payments. Benefits may be paid for the entire period of disability or a specified period of time. Cumulative maximums may apply to the amount paid. 6.9.4.2 Critical Illness \u00b6 The insurance will pay off the outstanding balance of the loan if the borrower is diagnosed with a covered illness. The payment will be made regardless of whether the borrower can work or not. Example (cont.) Big Bank has provided a personal loan to Homeowner. If she is diagnosed with a critical illness covered in the policy, Big Bank will receive a lump sum equal to the amount of the loan. 6.9.4.3 Unemployment \u00b6 The creditor is paid a monthly benefit to a specific dollar amount and for a specified period of time if the borrower becomes unemployed through no fault of his or her own. Example (cont.) Big Bank has provided a mortgage to Homeowner. She loses her job because her company is bought out by another. Homeowner is unemployed for 10 months and begins work again in month 11. Big Bank receives a sum every month for 10 months from the group creditor insurance. In month 11, Homeowner resumes her mortgage payments. 6.10 Group Life Insurance vs. Individual Life Insurance \u00b6 6.11 Advantages and Disadvantages of Group Life Insurance \u00b6","title":"Chapter 6 Group Life Insurance"},{"location":"life/Chapter_6_Group_Life_Insurance/#chapter-6-group-life-insurance","text":"","title":"Chapter 6: Group Life Insurance"},{"location":"life/Chapter_6_Group_Life_Insurance/#61-how-group-life-insurance-works","text":"Note that this chapter only deals with life insurance provided by group insurance plans.

Example Helen is a university graduate with an engineering degree, and she is registered as a professional engineer with an occupational association.

Optional membership for employees. The employee chooses to join and is required to pay a portion of the cost of insurance; This is called a contributory plan because the member contributes towards the premium; An employee can enroll in the plan after satisfying the group\u2019s probation period. The probationary period, also called the waiting period, is the length of time an employee must work with an employer before becoming eligible for group insurance coverage (usually three months); Upon becoming eligible, an employee has a limited amount of time to enroll in the group plan and obtain life insurance coverage without providing any evidence of insurability.

Proof of insurability is sometimes not required. In such cases, the additional coverage can only be purchased within a specific period of time.

Each will be discussed in detail. 7.1.1 Tax-Free Death Benefit \u00b6 The death benefit of a life insurance policy is paid to the beneficiary tax-free. This holds true regardless of how long the policy has been in place, how much the policyholder has paid in premiums and regardless of the type of policy. Example Susan bought a $500,000 whole life policy on her husband, Andrew, just a few months ago, and she has only paid $2,300 in premiums to date. Unfortunately, Andrew has just died. Susan will receive the entire death benefit of $500,000 tax-free. The death benefit includes the original face amount plus the entire amount paid out upon the death of the life insured. For example, if a universal life (UL) policy offers a level death benefit plus account value, the beneficiary will receive the original face amount plus the value of the investment account tax-free. Example Carl bought a $100,000 UL policy 6 years ago, naming his wife, Sarah, as the beneficiary. The policy provides for a death benefit equal to the initial coverage plus account value. To date, he has paid $9,250 in premiums, and the account value is $2,993. If Carl dies today, Sarah will receive a total of $102,993 tax-free. 7.1.2 Policy Dispositions \u00b6 A policy disposition can be actual or deemed. To dispose means to get rid of something. The disposition of a life insurance policy may result in tax for the policyholder. Taxation of Life Insurance and Tax Strategies In an actual policy disposition, the policyholder has to give up some or all his ownership rights to his policy: An example of an individual getting rid of all his or her ownership would be when a policyholder surrenders a policy and receives the policy\u2019s cash surrender value; An example of an individual getting rid of part of his or her ownership would be when a policyholder takes a policy loan. While a policyholder may not give up ownership rights to a policy, other events or transactions may result in a disposition. In a deemed disposition, the policyholder is considered to have gotten rid of some or all of his policy and received proceeds to that effect for tax purposes. A policy dividend is a deemed disposition. See Section 7.2 Examples of disposition include: Policy surrender; Withdrawal; Policy loan; Dividends; Assignment or transfer of ownership; Death of policyholder who is not the life insured, such that ownership is transferred to another party; and Policy loss of tax-exempt status. 7.1.3 Policy Gains \u00b6 When the policyholder disposes of some or all of his policy ownership, he may find there has been a policy gain. The policy gain must be reported as income for tax purposes the year it is received. The smaller the policy gain, the lower the tax exposure. Policy gain = proceeds of disposition - adjusted cost basis (ACB) Example 1 Ron surrendered his whole life policy. The proceeds (of disposition) were $20,000. The ACB was $17,000. The policy gain was $3,000 ( $20,000 - $17,000) and Ron reports the $3,000 as income on his income tax return. Example 2 Scott surrendered his whole life policy. The proceeds (of disposition) were $20,000. The ACB was $7,000. The policy gain was $13,000 ( $20,000 - $7,000) and Scott reports the $13,000 as income on his income tax return. 7.1.4 Adjusted Cost Basis (ACB) \u00b6 The adjusted cost basis (ACB) is the cost of a life insurance policy for tax purposes. The life insurance com-pany calculates the ACB and informs the policyholder of the ACB amount (usually done when a taxable disposition has occurred). The larger the ACB, the lower the tax because the policy gain is smaller. In the examples below, note how Marie has less income to report than Sally. Example 1 Marie surrendered her whole life policy. The proceeds (of disposition) were $50,000. The ACB was $40,000. The policy gain was $10,000 and Marie reported the $10,000 as income. Example 2 Sally surrendered her whole life policy. The proceeds (of disposition) were $50,000. The ACB was $30,000. The policy gain was $20,000 and Sally reported the $20,000 as income. 7.1.4.1 Last Acquired Date \u00b6 There are three ways to calculate the ACB depending on the date the policy was last acquired. \u201cLast acquired\u201d means the latest of the following dates: When the policy was purchased; When ownership was transferred to the current policyholder; When a change to coverage was made. Example Leon acquired a policy on his wife\u2019s life and named his son as a beneficiary in 1962. When Leon died in 2006, ownership of the policy was switched to Leon\u2019s contingent owner. The last acquired date of the policy was 2006. The last acquired date is also important in determining a policy\u2019s exempt or non-exempt status. For simplicity, policies can be categorized in three groups for tax purposes: Group 1 (G1) policies are those that were acquired prior to December 2, 1982, and that have not been transferred to another policyholder or been modified since that time. Group 2 (G2) policies are those were acquired after December 1, 1982, but before January 1, 2017, or pre-viously G1 policies that have lost their status. Group 3 (G3) policies are those that were issued after December 31, 2016, or previously G2 policies that have lost their status. A G1 policy will lose its status and become a G2 policy if ownership is transferred to another policyholder or if coverage is modified. Because G1 policies provide some significant tax advantages, agents should be careful about changing this status. A G2 policy will lose its status and become a G3 policy if it is converted to another type of policy on or after January 1, 2017. For example, a term policy that was issued in 2015 but that is converted to a permanent policy in May 2019 will be a G3 policy from that point forward. A G2 policy can also lose its status and become a G3 policy if any coverage that requires medical underwriting is added to the policy after January 1, 2017. Some examples include increasing the amount of coverage, adding a term rider to the policy, or substituting the life insured under the policy. 7.1.4.2 G1 Policies \u00b6 The calculation of the ACB of G1 policies (sometimes referred to as \u201cgrandfathered policies\u201d) is simply the cumulative premiums paid to date, less the cumulative dividends paid out of the policy. While 1982 was over 30 years ago, agents may still encounter active whole life or UL policies that were issued prior to December 2, 1982. The ACB calculated under the old method will generally be higher than the ACB calculated under the methods for G2 or G3 policies. Remember that a policy gain is calculated as (pro-ceeds of disposition \u2013 ACB), so a bigger ACB means a smaller policy gain, and thus a smaller tax liability for the policyholder. Other tax advantages for these grandfathered policies are covered in the Section Taxation of exempt vs. non-exempt policies. 7.1.4.3 G2 and G3 Policies \u00b6 For G2 and G3 policies, the key factors that determine a policy\u2019s ACB are the cumulative premiums less the net cost of pure insurance (NCPI). The NCPI is a measure of the pure mortality costs under the policy for a given year, and it reflects a combination of the net amount at risk (NAAR) and the mortality risk for the life insured. In the early years of a policy, the ACB of a policy increases because the NCPI is less than the premiums. However, as the life insured ages, his mortality risk increases to the point where the NCPI exceeds the premiums and the ACB of the policy decreases. Over time, the ACB can reduce to zero, but it can never be negative. Regulations to the Income Tax Act prescribe different methods of calculating both the NCPI and and NAAR for G2 and G3 policies. These regulations also prescribe the use of updated standardized mortality tables for G3 policies, reflecting increases in life expectancies. We aren\u2019t going to get into the specifics of these methods, but the general result of these changes is that: The NCPI of a G3 policy tends to be lower during the early years of the policy, compared to a G2 policy. Given the same premiums or deposits, this in turn means that the ACB of a G3 policy will tend to grow fast-er in the early years of the policy, compared to a G2 policy. It will take longer for the ACB of a G3 policy to reach zero as the life insured ages. These differences become important when you recall that the policy gain upon the disposition of an individually owned life insurance policy is the difference between the proceeds and the ACB. The situation becomes more complex if policy dividends, policy withdrawals or policy loans are involved, and further adjustments to the ACB are required, as summarized in Table 7.1. 7.2 Taxation of Policy Dividends \u00b6 According to the Income Tax Act, the payment of policy dividends triggers a deemed disposition of an interest in the insurance policy. The proceeds of disposition are deemed to be the amount of the policy dividend, less any amount that was used to pay an eligible premium. The policy gain is calculated as follows: Policy gain = (policy dividend - amount used to pay an eligible premium) - policy\u2019s ACB In most cases where the premiums are directed to internal transactions (i.e., through a paid-up addition (PUA) or term insurance dividend payment option, or to repay a policy loan), the resulting proceeds of disposition will be zero. This means there is no policy gain and no taxable income. Recall the following: Premiums paid by the policyholder increase the policy\u2019s ACB by the same amount. Dividends paid out to the policyholder in cash reduce the ACB. As a result, most policy dividends paid out to the policyholder end up being a tax-free return of premiums. However, for G2 policies, the \u201cpremiums\u201d for the purpose of calculating the policy\u2019s ACB for tax purposes exclude amounts the policyholder paid for accidental death benefits, disability payments, ratings for substandard lives, the cost of conversion rights or guaranteed insurability benefits, or any other supplementary benefit. For G3 policies, the full premiums are added to the ACB as they are paid, but then the cost of insurance related to any of these non-death benefits is deducted from the ACB as they are charged to the policy. Thus, if a G2 or G3 policy includes these types of benefits and if policy dividends are actually paid out to the policyholder, then there is a possibility that a policy gain may arise. The calculation of that gain is beyond the scope of this course. 7.3 Taxation of a Full Surrender \u00b6 A policyholder is said to fully surrender a life insurance policy when he cancels or terminates the policy, such that he has no further rights or obligations under that policy. A full surrender is considered to be a disposition for tax purposes. 7.3.1 Policy Gain Calculation \u00b6 In the case of a full surrender, the proceeds of this disposition are equal to the cash surrender value (CSV) of the policy, less any outstanding policy loans (including interest) or unpaid premiums. Policy gain = CSV - any outstanding policy loans (including interest) or unpaid premiums or unpaid premiums, less ACB If the policyholder of a G3 policy fully surrenders a policy with an outstanding policy loan, only the portion of the policy loan that was used to immediately pay premiums under the policy can be deducted. Example 7.4 Taxation of a Partial Surrender \u00b6 A partial surrender occurs when: Coverage is reduced (for example, when the face amount is reduced in a universal life policy); or A withdrawal is made from the accumulating fund in a universal life policy. 7.4.1 Reducing Coverage \u00b6 If the policyholder decides to reduce the amount of coverage, it is considered to be a disposition, so a policy gain can arise. For G2 policies, the policy gain on a partial surrender is calculated on a prorated basis, so the CSV and ACB used reflect the reduction in the coverage. Example (cont.) Suppose that instead of surrendering the policy entirely, Alicia decides to reduce her coverage from $200,000 to $150,000. This is considered to be a partial surrender, and she is deemed to have disposed of 25% of her policy. Percentage disposed = ( $200,000 \u2013 $150,000) \u00f7 $200,000 = 25% Recall that the policy has a CSV of $24,000 and an ACB of $10,000. Alicia will receive $6,000 upon reducing the coverage, which is the CSV associated with the reduction. Example (Cont.) CSV upon partial surrender = $24,000 \u00d7 25% = $6,000 The ACB associated with the reduction is $2,500. Prorated ACB = $10,000 \u00d7 25% = $2,500 This will result in a policy gain of $3,500 and $1,225 in tax payable. Policy gain = $6,000 \u2013 $2,500 = $3,500 Tax payable = $3,500 \u00d7 35% = $1,225 For a G3 policy, the policy gain is also calculated on a prorated basis, but in this case the proration is based on the ratio of the ACB of the policy to the policy\u2019s net cash value (i.e., the CSV less outstanding policy loans). For G1 policies, no proration is required. Withdrawals only result in a policy gain once cumulative with-drawals exceed the entire policy\u2019s ACB. 7.4.2 Policy Withdrawals \u00b6 A partial surrender may also refer to a withdrawal the policyholder makes from the accumulating fund of a UL policy, even if he does not reduce the coverage. To calculate the policy gain for G2 and G3 policies, the same prorated methodology is used as for a partial policy surrender. For a G2 policy, the policy gain is calculated using a prorated ACB. Policy gain = amount withdrawn - prorated ACB Example Janine has a $200,000 UL policy with an ACB of $65,00 and an accumulating fund with a cash value of $80,000. She wanted to withdraw $40,000 from the policy, and her marginal tax rate is 35%. The ACB prorated of her withdrawal would be $3,333.33. Prorated ACB = ( $40,000 \u00f7 $80,000) \u00d7 $65,000 = $32,500 Her policy gain would be $7,500. Policy gain = $40,000 \u2015 $32,500 = $7,500 She would have to pay income tax of $2,625 as a result of her withdrawal. Tax payable = $7,500 \u00d7 35% = $2,625 For G1 policies, no prorating is required. Withdrawals only result in a policy gain once cumulative withdrawals exceed the entire policy\u2019s ACB. 7.5 Taxation of Policy Loans \u00b6 If the policyholder takes out a policy loan, the proceeds of disposition equal the amount of the loan, less any amount of that loan that is applied to pay a premium under the policy. In the case of an automatic premium loan (APL), the deemed proceeds are nil, because the full amount of the loan is used to pay the premiums. If the policyholder takes out a policy loan that is less than the adjusted cost basis (ACB), he will not have a policy gain, but the ACB will be reduced by the amount of the loan: Proceeds of disposition = the loan amount-any portion of the loan used to pay the premium Example (cont.) If Alicia only took out a policy loan of $4,000, the policy\u2019s ACB would be reduced to $6,000. New ACB = $10,000 \u2013 $4,000 = $6,000 She would not have to report a policy gain. If a policyholder takes out a policy loan that is greater than the policy\u2019s ACB, they will have a policy gain equal to the amount of the loan, minus the ACB. The ACB of the policy will be reduced to zero. In the case of an APL, proceeds of disposition are nil since each loan is used, in full, to pay the premium. Example (cont.) Suppose that Alicia instead takes out a policy loan of $19,000. She would have a policy gain of $9,000 and $3,150 in tax payable. Policy gain = $19,000 \u2013 $10,000 = $9,000 Tax payable = $9,000 \u00d7 35% Her policy would now have an ACB of $0. 7.5.1 Repaying a Policy Loan \u00b6 If a policyholder repays a policy loan, that individual will be able to deduct the repayment from taxable income, up to the amount of the policy gain that had to be reported when the loan was taken. If an amount is repaid that is greater than the policy gain, it increases the ACB. Example (Cont.) Suppose that Alicia repays $12,000 of her $19,000 policy loan. She would be able to claim a tax deduction of $9,000, which is the amount of the policy gain she had to include in her income as a result of the loan. The ACB of her policy would increase to $3,000. ACB calculated as ( $12,000 \u2013 $9,000 = $3,000). 7.5.2 Policy Loan Interest \u00b6 Interest charged on a policy loan can be deducted from taxable income if the loan is used to earn business or property income. The interest is not deductible if the loan is for personal use or for investments that produce capital gains only. Therefore, interest charged on an APL cannot be deducted as APL\u2019s are not used to earn income. Does this exclude taking a policy loan for investments that produce a capital gain, such as stocks? The borrower must be able to show a link between the loan and the use of the loan. The loan must be traced to an investment that has a reasonable expectation of earning income in the form of interest, dividends, rents, or royalties. Capital gains are not considered income and neither are investments that return capital to the investor. Loans taken to invest in equities and equity funds will be tax deductible when there is an expectation that stock dividends will be paid. If interest is paid but it cannot be deducted from taxable income, the ACB is increased by the amount of interest. 7.6 Taxation of Exempt vs. Non-Exempt Policies \u00b6 The issue of whether a policy is tax exempt or not applies only to permanent life insurance policies. What is required for a policy to be tax exempt? Last acquired before December 2, 1982 (i.e., a G1 policy); Last acquired after December 1, 1982 (i.e., a G2 or G3 policy), and be used for life insurance and not as an investment. This is established by \u201ctesting\u201d the policy. Why is it important for a policy to be tax exempt? A tax-exempt policy provides the policyholder with tax-free growth on investment income earned in the UL investment account. Tax only applies if there is a policy disposition (such as policy surrender) before the life insured dies. Therefore, the tax-free death benefit can be enhanced by the increased value of the investment account since tax is not paid on the investment growth due to the policy being tax exempt. What could cause a policy to fail its tax exemption test? Paid-up additions; Better than expected investment returns; Dividend payments; More and/or larger deposits to the investment account. A non-exempt policy is a G2 or G3 policy that was last acquired after December 1, 1982, that fails to meet the exemption requirements set out by the Income Tax Act. Non-exempt policies are subject to annual accrual taxation, and the income earned must be reported. 7.6.1 Purpose of Exempt Test-Insurance or Investment \u00b6 Two rules are applied to determine whether a policy is really being used for insurance or as an investment vehicle disguised as insurance: The Maximum Actuarial Tax Reserve (MTAR) rule; The anti-dump-in rule. The rules are both benchmarks against which policy growth is measured. G1 policies are not subject to the exempt test and not subject to annual accrual taxation. 7.6.2 Maximum Actuarial Tax Reserve (MTAR) Rule \u00b6 To maintain exempt status, the cash value of a policy\u2019s accumulating fund (i.e., investment account) cannot exceed the Maximum Tax Actuarial Reserve (MTAR), which is the projected cash value of the accumulating fund of an exempt test policy. An exempt test policy (ETP) is a hypothetical policy that serves as a benchmark. It has the same death benefit and the same life insured as the real policy, with the remaining parameters set by the Income Tax Act. The projected future values of the accumulating fund cannot exceed the projected MTAR at any time in the future, up until the date the life insured reaches a specified age (85 for G2 policies and 90 for G3 policies). On the policy\u2019s issue date and on every policy anniversary thereafter, the insurance company must compare the current and projected cash values of the actual policy\u2019s accumulating fund with the MTAR of the ETP, and report the results to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). 7.6.2.1 8-Pay endowment at age 90 for G3 policies \u00b6 Endowment occurs when the CSV equals the face amount of a policy. Policies issued after December 31, 2016 (i.e., G3 policies) the ETP is deemed to receive annual deposits over 8 years that are large enough ensure that the policy will endow at age 90. Essentially it is a limited payment whole life policy, as discussed in Chapter 3. A policy endows when its cash surrender value (CSV) equals the policy\u2019s face amount. For G3 policies, when comparing the cash values of the actual policy to the ETP, the accumulating fund is calculated as the cash value determined without regard to surrender. If this value is less than the MTAR of the ETP, then the policy is exempt from annual accrual taxation. 7.6.2.2 20-Pay endowment at age 85 for G2 policies \u00b6 For G2 policies, the ETP is deemed to receive annual deposits over 20 years, and the deposits are large enough to ensure that the policy will endow at age 85. In other words, for G2 policies the MTAR line of the ETP describes an accumulating fund that will grow to equal the death benefit by the time the life insured reaches age 85, based on fixed deposits over 20 years and growth at an assumed interest rate of at least 4%, minus the cost of insurance. The impact of the changes implemented for G3 policies effective for January 1, 2017, will vary by insurance company, but in general the maximum deposits permitted for a G3 policy while still maintaining exempt status will be lower than the maximum deposits permitted for a G2 policy. 7.6.3 Maximum Tax Actuarial Reserve (MTAR) Remedies \u00b6 The insurance company that issued the policy is responsible for ensuring its policies remain tax-exempt (applying and monitoring the results of the MTAR rule). However, while life insurance policies are initially designed to be exempt, it is possible for a policy to become non-exempt after issue. This is usually due to investment returns being higher than expected. What happens if a policy fails its test? If a policy fails its test on its anniversary due to exceptional investment performance - or other reasons - the Income Tax Act provides a 60-day period to reverse the excess value and restore the tax-exempt status of the policy. Most policies are designed to automatically implement changes if needed using one of the methods described below. 7.6.3.1 Increasing the Face Amount \u00b6 The death benefit can be increased, which will also increase the death benefit of the exempt test policy, which raises the MTAR threshold. The maximum annual increase is 8%. 7.6.3.2 Withdrawing Premiums \u00b6 A withdrawal can be made. It will not result in a policy gain if the amount withdrawn is less than the prorated ACB. Example James had a UL policy with an ACB of $226,000 and CSV of $400,000. He had to withdraw $10,000 from the accumulating fund to maintain the policy\u2019s exempt status. The prorated ACB of his withdrawal is $5,650. Prorated ACB = ( $10,000 \u00f7 $400,000) \u00d7 $226,000 = $5,650 This will result in a policy gain of $4,350. Policy gain = $10,000 \u2013 $5,650 = $4,350 7.6.3.3 Side Funds \u00b6 The excess can be moved to a side fund. The side fund is also called a shuttle account and is used to prevent the entire policy from becoming non-exempt. The side fund is a taxable account. Money in the side fund can be returned to the investment account of the main policy when the policy\u2019s accumulated fund (cash value) is less than the MTAR threshold. 7.6.4 Anti-Dump-In Rule \u00b6 This rule is used instead of the MTAR and is also called the 250% rule. It prevents the policyholder from making large lump-sum deposits after the 7 th anniversary of the policy. This rule applies to G2 and G3 policies. 7.6.4.1 Applying the 250% Rule \u00b6 Every year, beginning on the 10 th anniversary of the policy, the value of the investment fund is compared to its value three years before. That is, year 10 is compared to year 7; year 11 is compared to year eight; year 12 to year nine, and so on. If the fund value is 250% or more of the value of the fund three years prior, the anti-dump-in provision will apply. Example On its 7 th anniversary, Dean\u2019s policy had a cash value of $4,200. On its 10 th anniversary, the policy had a cash value of $15,600. This is 371 % of its value three years prior. Current cash value = ( $15,600 \u00f7 $4,200) \u00d7 100% = 371% Because this exceeds 250%, the anti-dump-in provision will apply. The anti-dump-in provision resets the date of the exempt test policy (ETP) to the third preceding anniversary. The policy\u2019s cash value is then compared with the (usually lower) MTAR of the re-dated ETP, which will make it more prone to failing the exempt test. If value exceeds 250% growth, the same remedy measures discussed earlier may be taken to ensure the policy will continue to be tax exempt: Increase the policy face amount; Make a withdrawal; Move the excess to a side fund. 7.6.4.2 Implications for Minimum-Funded Policies \u00b6 When a policy is minimum-funded in the early years, the policy\u2019s cash values remain relatively low. If the policyholder later makes large deposits, this could easily result in a substantial increase in the policy\u2019s cash value, which in turn could trigger the application of the anti-dump-in rule and increase the potential for the policy losing its exempt status. However, beginning January 1, 2017, a relief measure was introduced to relax the 250% rule somewhat for under-endowed policies. This new provision allows the accumulating fund of the policy to grow by more than 250% over the three-year period specified by the test if the value of the accumulating fund of the actual policy is less than 15% of the value of the ETP\u2019s accumulating fund for G2 polices or 37.5% of the ETP\u2019s ac-cumulating fund for G3 policies. 7.6.5 If a Policy Becomes Non-Exempt \u00b6 Because of the safeguards built into a policy and the available MTAR remedies, a policy rarely fails the exempt test. Nevertheless, it still does sometimes happen and the resulting consequences can be quite severe. Once it becomes non-exempt, it is permanently non-exempt. Some of the situations that have the potential to make a policy fail the exempt test include: Paid-up additions (PUAs), because they have a high ratio of cash value relative to the amount of coverage they provide; Better investment returns than expected; Extra deposits to participating policies; Extra deposits to the policy. 7.6.5.1 Deemed Disposition \u00b6 If a policy becomes non-exempt, it is considered to be a policy disposition for tax purposes. While the policyholder has not surrendered the policy and has not received the CSV, the deemed policy gain will be taxed at the policyholder\u2019s marginal tax rate. 7.6.5.2 Annual Accrual Rules \u00b6 Once a policy becomes non-exempt, investment income must be reported for tax purposes by the policyholder every year. 7.7 Tax Implications of Replacing an Existing Policy \u00b6 Replacing an existing policy with a new policy has many implications for the policyholder, including tax considerations. 7.7.1 Policy Disposition \u00b6 Putting a new policy in place involves the cancellation of the old policy. The surrender of the \u201cold\u201d policy is a disposition. There will be a policy gain if the CSV is greater than the ACB. 7.7.2 Tax Advantages of Older Policies \u00b6 G1 policies have extra tax advantages not available to new policies: Not subject to exempt testing; Not subject to annual accrual taxation; The ACB is generally higher because it is calculated as: cumulative premiums paid to date \u2013 dividends paid out of the policy. This higher ACB will likely result in a lower policy gain upon disposition. These tax advantages need to be taken into consideration before replacing an older policy. Replacing a G2 policy with a G3 policy could have tax consequences. 7.8 Absolute Assignments \u00b6 An absolute assignment change ownership, control and right under a life insurance policy from a policyholder to a new policyholder. There may be tax consequences as a result of an absolute assignment depending on who received ownership and how the transfer was accomplished. 7.8.1 General Rule \u00b6 Separate rules apply depending on whether the new owner is a non-arm\u2019s length party or an arm\u2019s length party. Non-arm\u2019s length is a relationship between relatives or people with a common interest. Arm\u2019s length parties act in their own independent economic self-interest. They have no mutual relationship. The policyholder\u2019s policy gain when a policy is transferred to an arm\u2019s length party is the transfer price minus the ACB. The new owner acquires the policy at an ACB equal to the transfer price. 7.8.2 To a Non-Arm\u2019s Length Party \u00b6 Exceptions to the general rule apply if an absolute assignment occurs via one of the following situations: The transfer is via a gift or bequest; The transfer is from a corporation; The transfer is a result of the operation of law (e.g., transfer to a successor owner or a joint owner with right of survivorship); The transfer is to any other non-arm\u2019s length party. When a non-arm\u2019s length transfer occurs, then the proceeds of disposition are deemed to be equal to the amount that the policyholder would have received if he had fully surrendered the policy in a way that two complete strangers (two arms\u2019 length individuals) might (unless the spousal or child rollover rules apply - discussed shortly). The person who acquires the policy acquires it with an ACB equal to this same amount. This keeps the policyholder from avoiding a policy gain by giving the policy away, or selling it to someone else at a discount to its true value. 7.8.3 Assigning a Policy to a Spouse \u00b6 Property ownership can roll over from one spouse to another without tax liability. This includes ownership of a life insurance policy. Spouse receives the policy with the same ACB regardless of what form or amount of payment has been made, if any. 7.8.3.1 Opting Out of the Spousal Rollover \u00b6 The spousal rollover is automatic. However, the transferring spouse can choose to opt out of the rollover by filing a special election with his tax return. Opting out may be desirable if a policyholder expected a policy gain as a result of the assignment. This would be wise if: The policyholder had the lower marginal tax rate of the two; The policyholder had income losses to apply against a policy gain. 7.8.3.2 Income Attribution Rules \u00b6 Income earned on property (including interest, stock dividends and rent) will be attributed to its original owner when ownership is transferred to a spouse. Thus, the transferring spouse has the tax liability for the income even though the property legally belongs to the recipient spouse. Attribution rules end with the death of the transferring spouse. 7.8.4 Assigning a Policy to a Child \u00b6 A policy can be assigned to a child when the child is old enough to legally bind a contract. The Income Tax Act also allows a policyholder to rollover an insurance policy to a child if all of the following conditions apply: The transfer is done for no consideration (i.e., the child didn\u2019t pay the policyholder for the policy); The life insured by the policy is the child or that child\u2019s child. The rollover will not apply if the policyholder is transferring a policy to his child and the policyholder is the life insured under that policy. Should the child dispose of the policy, the policy gain triggered upon disposition will be taxable to the child if the child is at least 18 years old by the end of the year. If the child is under 18, the policy gain attribution rules apply and the income is taxable in the hands of the original policyholder. 7.8.4.1 Defining \u201cChild\u201d \u00b6 The definition of a \u201cchild\u201d for the rollover is a natural or adopted: Child; Grandchild; Great-grandchild; and Person who was financially dependent on the policyholder before age 19. 7.8.4.2 Direct Transfers Only \u00b6 The rollover must be made directly to the child and not via a trust. 7.8.4.3 Education Funding or Other Intergenerational Transfers \u00b6 The rollover to a child provides a way to transfer wealth and receive tax advantages. A UL policy could roll over to a child. At age 18, the child could surrender the policy. The child is likely to have little or no taxable income and, therefore, there will be little or no tax owing on the proceeds of the policy. Surrender cannot occur before age 18 or income attribution to the policyholder will apply. 7.9 Death of the Policyholder \u00b6 When a policyholder dies who is not the life insured, there is a deemed disposition of the policy. For tax purposes, death is treated much like an absolute assignment. 7.9.1 Rollover to Spouse \u00b6 The policy can roll over to the spouse without tax consequences for the policyholder or spouse. 7.9.2 Contingent Policyholder \u00b6 A contingent policyholder becomes the policyholder after the death of the original policyholder. He is also known as a successor policyholder. The original policyholder names the contingent policyholder. Probate (tax) on the policy gain is avoided by naming a contingent policyholder. However, any policy gain must still be reported on the tax return of the deceased policyholder unless the policy is rolling over to the spouse. 7.9.2.1 Rollover to a Child \u00b6 A child may be named as successor owner. He will automatically assume policy ownership on the death of the policyholder. 7.10 Taxation of Life Insurance Strategies \u00b6 This section explores the tax implications of various strategies that can be implemented using insurance. 7.10.1 Using the Policy as Collateral \u00b6 Collateral assignment occurs when the policyholder (the borrower) uses the cash value in a policy as collateral to secure a loan from a third party (the lender). Such an assignment transfers the rights for the cash value and death benefit to the lender. If the borrower fails to repay his debt, the lender can surrender the policy and receive the CSV to cover the debt. If the borrower dies, the lender can receive the death benefit when the borrower is the same as the life insured. If the life insured is another person, the lender can take the CSV by surrendering the policy. A collateral assignment does not create a policy gain. The cash value of the policy continues to grow on a tax-sheltered basis during the period of the assignment. 7.10.1.1 Borrowing for Business Use \u00b6 A collateral assignment could be made on a loan for personal or for business use. 7.10.1.2 Deducting Premiums \u00b6 All or part of the premiums may be tax deductible when a business loan is taken and secured by a collateral assignment. To be tax deductible, the loan must be from an authorized lender and the collateral assignment must be one of the requirements for the loan. The amount of the tax deduction is the lesser of: The net cost of pure insurance; Premiums paid. If the death benefit is larger than the loan, the tax deduction is prorated as a percentage of the death benefit. Example Heloise borrowed $200,000 from a financial institution to expand her business. The lender required the collateral assignment of her $500,000 universal life policy, which had an adjusted cost basis (ACB) of $160,000 and a cash surrender value (CSV) of $250,000. Heloise paid premiums of $12,000 annually, with an NCPI of $3,200. Because Heloise\u2019s policy is for $500,000 but the loan is only for $200,000, she can only deduct 40% of the NCPI. Percentage of NCPI deductible = $200,000 \u00f7 $500,000 = 40% So, she can deduct $1,280 as a business expense. Deduction = 40% \u00d7 $3,200 = $1,280 7.10.2 Annuitizing the Cash Surrender Value (CSV) \u00b6 To \u201cannuitize\u201d means to transfer value from a life insurance policy to an annuity which will provide an ongoing series of income payments, either for a fixed term or for life. Annuitizing a policy is equivalent to cancelling or surrendering a policy. Thus, when a policy is annuitized, there is a policy gain (equal to CSV minus ACB). 7.10.2.1 If the Policyholder is Disabled \u00b6 As a tax relief to individuals who are totally and permanently disabled, when a policy is annuitized the policy gain can be spread over all annuity payments. This can reduce tax payable on the policy gain as a result of the policy gain being taxed at a lower rate because the marginal tax rate over the annuitization period will likely be lower. 7.10.2.2 Partial Surrender \u00b6 It is possible to use only part of the CSV for an annuity. This is considered a partial surrender with a prorated policy gain (see Section 7.4) 7.10.3 Leveraging a Life Insurance Policy \u00b6 This is known as an insured retirement strategy. It is where retired policyholders leverage their existing insurance policies to create a source of tax-free retirement income. 7.10.3.1 Collateralizing the Cash Surrender Value (CSV) \u00b6 The strategy is based on the ability of the policyholder to take a loan and provide the policy as collateral in a collateral assignment. Under an insured retirement strategy, the policyholder negotiates a series of annual loans, where each loan is secured by the policy\u2019s CSV. Each loan is tax-free to the policyholder. Therefore, it does not form part of taxable income. This appeals to those who wish to keep their income\u2014and the corresponding marginal tax rate\u2014low. On the death of the life insured, the loan amount is repaid to the lender by the death benefit; excess above the debt is paid to the beneficiary. 7.10.3.2 Interest Paid or Capitalized \u00b6 Interest will be charged on loans made to the policyholder. It may have to be paid annually. Alternatively, the lender can allow for the interest to accumulate and be paid from the death benefit (this is known as being capitalized): Interest paid annually reduces the sum the policyholder receives; Capitalized interest reduces the sum the beneficiary receives. 7.10.4 Charitable Giving \u00b6 By assigning a new or existing policy to a charity or naming a charity as the beneficiary of a new or existing policy, the policyholder receives the benefit of a charitable donations tax credit. 7.10.4.1 Charitable Donations Tax Credit \u00b6 A donation to a registered charity results in a charitable donations tax credit: The credit is non-refundable; Tax credits can reduce income tax; A federal credit rate of 15% is applied to the first $200 of donations; the federal credit rate of 29% is applied on amounts over $200. Example Mahmoud lives in New Brunswick, where the provincial tax credit on charitable donations is 8.79% on the first $200, and 21% on amounts over $200. Last year he donated $2,000 to his favourite registered charity. It was his only donation, and his taxable income was $150,000. He was able to claim a total of $947.58 as a charitable donations tax credit, calculated as follows: Federal tax credit on first $200 = $200 \u00d7 15% = $30.00 Federal tax credit on balance = ( $2,000 \u2013 $200) \u00d7 29% = $522.00 Provincial tax credit on first $200 = $200 \u00d7 8.79% = $17.58 Provincial tax credit on balance = ( $2,000 \u2013 $200) \u00d7 21% = $378.00 Total federal and provincial tax credits = $947.58 Mahmoud can deduct this from the total income tax he would otherwise have to pay. Spouses can combine their donations to avoid doubling up on the lower tax credit rate. Limits apply to the amount that can be claimed: During life, the limit is 75% of net income. It can be claimed up to five years after the donation is made; In the year of death, the limit is increased to 100% of net income. It can be claimed for the year of death and the year before. Note: the federal tax credit rate is 15% on the first $200 of donations and 29% on donations over $200. The federal tax credit is the same regardless of where one resides in Canada. The provincial tax credit will differ depending on the province where the policyholder resides. 7.10.4.2 Assigning a New Insurance Policy to a Charity \u00b6 A brand-new policy can be assigned to a registered charity provided the charity is willing and able to take ownership of it. However, because it has not had time to develop a cash value, there is no charitable donation. The policyholder does not receive a tax credit. If the policyholder continues to pay premiums on the policy after the assignment, the premiums paid become eligible for a tax credit receipt. This is true for both permanent and term policies. 7.10.4.3 Assigning an Existing Insurance Policy to a Charity \u00b6 An existing policy can be assigned to a registered charity provided the charity is willing and able to take over ownership of the policy. If so, a tax receipt will be issued: Equal to CSV or fair market value of the policy; or For premiums paid after assignment if the donor continues to pay the premiums. Since term insurance has no CSV, the assignment of an existing term policy will not result in a tax receipt. An absolute policy assignment is a deemed disposition for tax purposes. Thus, at the time of assignment, the policy gain is determined (CSV minus ACB) and is taxable to the policyholder. 7.10.4.4 Naming a Charity as the Beneficiary \u00b6 Naming a charity as beneficiary provides a tax receipt to the policyholder in the amount of the death benefit that is paid out when the life insured dies. The policyholder will not get a tax receipt for the premiums paid on the policy after naming the charity as the beneficiary. When the policyholder is the life insured, the tax receipt can be used by the executor to generate a charitable donations tax credit for the year of death, the immediately preceding year and the policyholder\u2019s last two taxation years. 7.10.5 Managing Taxes Upon Death \u00b6 Life insurance is often used to provide the funds to pay for the taxes that become due upon death. Taxes that are triggered by death include: Tax on capital gains; Tax resulting from the collapsing of registered plans (RRSP, RRIF); Taxes due on the estate; and Probate fees. Using life insurance proceeds to pay these taxes means the estate is saved such costs. Therefore, the value of the estate is enhanced for its inheritors. Agents must be able to estimate taxes on death to ensure life insurance coverage is adequate if the purpose of the insurance is to pay taxes and reduce the tax burden of the estate. It is recommended that agents review the module, Life Insurance Taxation Principles, to ensure they are familiar with these tax principles.","title":"Chapter 7 Taxation of Life Insurance and Tax Strategies"},{"location":"life/Chapter_7_Taxation_of_Life_Insurance_and_Tax_Strategies/#chapter-7-taxation-of-life-insurance-and-tax-strategies","text":"","title":"Chapter 7: Taxation of Life Insurance and Tax Strategies"},{"location":"life/Chapter_7_Taxation_of_Life_Insurance_and_Tax_Strategies/#71-key-concepts","text":"The following key concepts are essential to understanding how life insurance is taxed: Tax-free death benefit; Policy dispositions; Policy gains; and Adjusted cost basis.

For example, if a universal life (UL) policy offers a level death benefit plus account value, the beneficiary will receive the original face amount plus the value of the investment account tax-free.

While a policyholder may not give up ownership rights to a policy, other events or transactions may result in a disposition. In a deemed disposition, the policyholder is considered to have gotten rid of some or all of his policy and received proceeds to that effect for tax purposes. A policy dividend is a deemed disposition.

Example Leon acquired a policy on his wife\u2019s life and named his son as a beneficiary in 1962. When Leon died in 2006, ownership of the policy was switched to Leon\u2019s contingent owner. The last acquired date of the policy was 2006. The last acquired date is also important in determining a policy\u2019s exempt or non-exempt status. For simplicity, policies can be categorized in three groups for tax purposes: Group 1 (G1) policies are those that were acquired prior to December 2, 1982, and that have not been transferred to another policyholder or been modified since that time. Group 2 (G2) policies are those were acquired after December 1, 1982, but before January 1, 2017, or pre-viously G1 policies that have lost their status. Group 3 (G3) policies are those that were issued after December 31, 2016, or previously G2 policies that have lost their status. A G1 policy will lose its status and become a G2 policy if ownership is transferred to another policyholder or if coverage is modified. Because G1 policies provide some significant tax advantages, agents should be careful about changing this status. A G2 policy will lose its status and become a G3 policy if it is converted to another type of policy on or after January 1, 2017. For example, a term policy that was issued in 2015 but that is converted to a permanent policy in May 2019 will be a G3 policy from that point forward. A G2 policy can also lose its status and become a G3 policy if any coverage that requires medical underwriting is added to the policy after January 1, 2017. Some examples include increasing the amount of coverage, adding a term rider to the policy, or substituting the life insured under the policy.","title":"7.1.4.1 Last Acquired Date"},{"location":"life/Chapter_7_Taxation_of_Life_Insurance_and_Tax_Strategies/#7142-g1-policies","text":"The calculation of the ACB of G1 policies (sometimes referred to as \u201cgrandfathered policies\u201d) is simply the cumulative premiums paid to date, less the cumulative dividends paid out of the policy.

The NCPI is a measure of the pure mortality costs under the policy for a given year, and it reflects a combination of the net amount at risk (NAAR) and the mortality risk for the life insured. In the early years of a policy, the ACB of a policy increases because the NCPI is less than the premiums. However, as the life insured ages, his mortality risk increases to the point where the NCPI exceeds the premiums and the ACB of the policy decreases. Over time, the ACB can reduce to zero, but it can never be negative. Regulations to the Income Tax Act prescribe different methods of calculating both the NCPI and and NAAR for G2 and G3 policies. These regulations also prescribe the use of updated standardized mortality tables for G3 policies, reflecting increases in life expectancies. We aren\u2019t going to get into the specifics of these methods, but the general result of these changes is that: The NCPI of a G3 policy tends to be lower during the early years of the policy, compared to a G2 policy. Given the same premiums or deposits, this in turn means that the ACB of a G3 policy will tend to grow fast-er in the early years of the policy, compared to a G2 policy. It will take longer for the ACB of a G3 policy to reach zero as the life insured ages. These differences become important when you recall that the policy gain upon the disposition of an individually owned life insurance policy is the difference between the proceeds and the ACB. The situation becomes more complex if policy dividends, policy withdrawals or policy loans are involved, and further adjustments to the ACB are required, as summarized in Table 7.1.","title":"7.1.4.3 G2 and G3 Policies"},{"location":"life/Chapter_7_Taxation_of_Life_Insurance_and_Tax_Strategies/#72-taxation-of-policy-dividends","text":"According to the Income Tax Act, the payment of policy dividends triggers a deemed disposition of an interest in the insurance policy. The proceeds of disposition are deemed to be the amount of the policy dividend, less any amount that was used to pay an eligible premium. The policy gain is calculated as follows: Policy gain = (policy dividend - amount used to pay an eligible premium) - policy\u2019s ACB In most cases where the premiums are directed to internal transactions (i.e., through a paid-up addition (PUA) or term insurance dividend payment option, or to repay a policy loan), the resulting proceeds of disposition will be zero. This means there is no policy gain and no taxable income. Recall the following: Premiums paid by the policyholder increase the policy\u2019s ACB by the same amount. Dividends paid out to the policyholder in cash reduce the ACB. As a result, most policy dividends paid out to the policyholder end up being a tax-free return of premiums. However, for G2 policies, the \u201cpremiums\u201d for the purpose of calculating the policy\u2019s ACB for tax purposes exclude amounts the policyholder paid for accidental death benefits, disability payments, ratings for substandard lives, the cost of conversion rights or guaranteed insurability benefits, or any other supplementary benefit. For G3 policies, the full premiums are added to the ACB as they are paid, but then the cost of insurance related to any of these non-death benefits is deducted from the ACB as they are charged to the policy. Thus, if a G2 or G3 policy includes these types of benefits and if policy dividends are actually paid out to the policyholder, then there is a possibility that a policy gain may arise.

A tax-exempt policy provides the policyholder with tax-free growth on investment income earned in the UL investment account.

Current cash value = ( $15,600 \u00f7 $4,200) \u00d7 100% = 371% Because this exceeds 250%, the anti-dump-in provision will apply. The anti-dump-in provision resets the date of the exempt test policy (ETP) to the third preceding anniversary. The policy\u2019s cash value is then compared with the (usually lower) MTAR of the re-dated ETP, which will make it more prone to failing the exempt test. If value exceeds 250% growth, the same remedy measures discussed earlier may be taken to ensure the policy will continue to be tax exempt: Increase the policy face amount; Make a withdrawal; Move the excess to a side fund.","title":"7.6.4.1 Applying the 250% Rule"},{"location":"life/Chapter_7_Taxation_of_Life_Insurance_and_Tax_Strategies/#7642-implications-for-minimum-funded-policies","text":"When a policy is minimum-funded in the early years, the policy\u2019s cash values remain relatively low.

However, beginning January 1, 2017, a relief measure was introduced to relax the 250% rule somewhat for under-endowed policies. This new provision allows the accumulating fund of the policy to grow by more than 250% over the three-year period specified by the test if the value of the accumulating fund of the actual policy is less than 15% of the value of the ETP\u2019s accumulating fund for G2 polices or 37.5% of the ETP\u2019s ac-cumulating fund for G3 policies.","title":"7.6.4.2 Implications for Minimum-Funded Policies"},{"location":"life/Chapter_7_Taxation_of_Life_Insurance_and_Tax_Strategies/#765-if-a-policy-becomes-non-exempt","text":"Because of the safeguards built into a policy and the available MTAR remedies, a policy rarely fails the exempt test.

The death of a business owner or employee who is key to a business can have a significant negative effect on the overall success of the business. These effects may include the following: Loss of skills; Creditor demands; Family interference; Equality for family members; and Capital gains tax. 8.1.1 Loss of skills \u00b6 Many businesses have an employee, or a combination of employees, whose skills are vital to the business. The employee(s) may have long-term knowledge of the business, expertise, or ideas that others do not have \u2013 and this knowledge and experience may also be difficult to replace. Such a person is instrumental to business success. This is the person who is called a \u201ckey person,\u201d or \u201ckey employee.\u201d Examples of \u201ckey persons\u201d may include highly skilled craftspeople, charismatic salespeople, or an influential vice president. Death of a key employee can bring about the collapse of a business if revenues decline as a result of the death. Example Monica is a talented architect who works for a company specializing in the design of professional offices for lawyers and surgical specialists. The owners of the firm believe that about 30% of their business is due to the clients who specifically seek out Monica\u2019s talents. Monica\u2019s death would have a significant impact on the company\u2019s revenue. 8.1.2 Creditor demands \u00b6 Businesses may take on loans in the form of demand loans, which have no fixed term or set duration. Instead, a demand loan must be repaid to the lender on its request, as long as any required notice is provided. Death of a key employee can make lenders very nervous. They may demand repayment of a loan and/or refuse additional loans because of the uncertainty of future revenues. Example Cooper was the senior sales director for an advertising firm and he has just died. Before his death, he was responsible for bringing in about 50% of the firm\u2019s new business. The company recently took out a $500,000 demand loan to completely revamp their IT infrastructure to allow them to develop new holographic ads. They were relying on Cooper to drive the sales needed to pay back the loan. However, when the bank heard about Cooper\u2019s death and saw the company\u2019s latest sales figures, they recalled the loan and demanded repayment in full. 8.1.3 Family member interference \u00b6 Businesses created as partnerships or private corporations may have more than one owner. For example, Abid and his brothers Amir, Farid and Danush own a company that imports Persian rugs. They each own a 25% share in the business. Problems may arise if one owner dies and their family member or members inherit the deceased owner\u2019s share of the business. To continue the example above, if Farid dies unexpectedly, his wife Gohar would inherit his shares. Those inheritors may not be familiar with the business and may have unrealistic expectations for profitability and distribution of revenue. To continue the example, Farid never revealed any details about the business to Gohar, who expects dividends to be paid quarterly. However, if dividends are paid quarterly, money will not be available in the business to buy more inventory. Without inventory, the business will be ruined. An inheritor may be willing to sell their newly acquired share of the business but at a selling price that is unreasonable and unrealistic for the other owners to pay. To continue the example, Gohar may be willing to sell the share of the business she inherited from Farid. However, with no knowledge of the business, she sets a price that is too high. The remaining shareholders refuse to meet her price. Family hostility ensues. Example Jason, Ivan, and Connor were the joint owners of Restful Solutions, a funeral home that caters to the upper class of society. Jason died without a will and he was survived only by Mason, his 24-year-old son. Mason is a troubled young adult with a history of petty theft and drug use. Mason inherited Jason\u2019s ownership interest in Restful Solutions. He showed up drunk at the funeral home shortly after his father\u2019s death and loudly announced his intention to take over his father\u2019s role in the business. When Ivan and Connor tried to tell him that it was not a suitable role for him, he demanded $1,200,000 for his share in the business. 8.1.4 Equality for family members \u00b6 A parent who is a business owner will, most probably, want to treat all his children fairly when it comes to the distribution of his estate. It is important to note that treating children \u201cfairly\u201d does not mean treating them exactly the same, or identically. Creating a fair distribution can be a challenge when children have differing expectations, but is especially important when planning business succession. Parents may need to be creative in order to put plans in place that treat all children fairly. Example Christina is the sole owner of a very successful garden centre, Hibiscus, which is an incorporated company worth about $1.5 million. Christina has two children who are in their twenties; Harry shares his mother\u2019s passion for gardening and has worked at the garden centre since the age of 10. Nancy is a doctor and has never had any interest in the business. Christina would love for Harry to carry on the business if she dies, but she worries about treating Nancy fairly. Christina\u2019s other assets are limited to about $400,000, and she feels it would be unfair to leave the business to Harry while only leaving $400,000 to Nancy. 8.1.5 Capital gains tax \u00b6 When a Canadian taxpayer dies, they are deemed (for tax purposes) to have disposed of their property at its fair market value immediately prior to death \u2013 unless a spousal rollover applies. Shares of a business may roll over to a spouse without tax consequences. Shares received by any other person may be subject to capital gains tax. In the case of an active and prosperous business, where shares are not left to a surviving spouses, this can result in a significant tax bill payable at the death of the business owner (on their final tax return). The capital gains tax that would be payable is calculated as follows: Taxable capital gain = (fair market value of business shares - adjusted cost base) \u00d7 50% Tax owing = taxable capital gain \u00d7 MTR Example 1 Fair market value of business = $1 million Adjusted cost base = $100,000 Capital gain = $900,000 Taxable capital gain = $450,000 (50% of capital gain) Tax owing if MTR is 40% = $180,000 Example 2 Lori owns a 20% interest in a business corporation that she wants to pass on to her daughter, Olivia when she dies. The shares currently have an adjusted cost base (ACB) of $100,000 and a fair market value (FMV) of $600,000, so if she dies today, this would result in a taxable capital gain of $250,000, calculated as (( $600,000 \u2013 $100,000 ) \u00d7 50%). If her marginal tax rate is 50%, this would result in an income tax liability of $125,000. If her estate cannot pay that income tax and her daughter cannot either, then her executor would be forced to sell some of the shares to pay the tax bill. 8.2 Business types \u00b6 Businesses may be structured three ways: Sole proprietorship; Partnership; or Corporation. 8.2.1 Sole proprietorship \u00b6 A sole proprietorship is the least formal structure of the three structures that are available. It has one owner who personally pays all expenses and personally earns all income. The sole proprietor is usually the operator of the business, and the death of the sole proprietor could have a catastrophic impact on the business. The business itself is not a separate entity from the sole proprietor and has no adjusted cost base; and assets of the business, such as product inventory, become part of the owner\u2019s personal estate at death. 8.2.2 Partnerships \u00b6 A partnership is a business that is owned by two or more people who have the common purpose of earning a profit. Each owner has a partnership interest. There are several forms a partnership interest can take. They are: A partner who receives a share of partnership income and is jointly and severally responsible for partnership debt and liabilities; A passive or silent partner who participates financially but is otherwise uninvolved; A general partner who is required in a limited partnership to be personally responsible for partnership debt and liabilities; A limited partner who is found in a limited partnership and has no responsibility for partnership debt and liabilities (note that a partnership must always have at least one general partner; a partnership cannot be composed entirely of limited partners). A partnership interest has some of the same attributes as a corporate share: It has a value; It has an adjusted cost base; It can have a capital gain or loss; It can be bought, sold, or bequeathed (given through a will) on death of the partner; From a tax perspective, each partner must report their share of net partnership income on their personal tax return. Because a partnership interest may give rise to a capital gain upon the death of a partner, a tax liability may also arise at the partner\u2019s death. The impact of this tax bill can be devastating unless it is anticipated through careful planning. 8.2.3 Corporations \u00b6 A corporation is a legal entity in which shares of the corporation are created. The individuals who receive or buy those shares are the shareholders of the corporation. The corporation is separate and distinct from the shareholders, who are not personally liable for the debts and liabilities of the corporation (unless they personally guaranteed those debts). Shareholders, if they are directors of the corporation, may be held personally liable for the company\u2019s income taxes and any amounts that are deducted at source from payroll (such as Employment Insurance and Canada Pension Plan premiums, and employee income tax withholdings). Income received by the corporation may be paid to shareholders as salary if the shareholder is employed by the corporation and as stock dividends to all shareholders. Like policy dividends, stock dividends are not guaranteed. The corporation\u2019s shareholders do not report the company\u2019s net income on their tax return. Instead, that net income is taxed in the corporation, and after-tax corporate profits are either retained in the corporation, increasing share value; or are paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends. Shares have value and an adjusted cost base that can lead to a capital gain or loss when they are sold. As with a partnership interest, the resulting tax liability can be significant and should be considered during planning. 8.2.3.1 Public vs. private corporations \u00b6 There are some significant differences in the tax rules for public and certain private corporations. Shares of a public corporation are traded on a stock exchange such as the TSX. Shares of a private corporation are not publicly traded. They are issued to employees and others with an interest in the business. A Canadian-Controlled Private Corporation (CCPC) is a private corporation that resides in Canada, is Canadian-controlled, and is not controlled by a public corporation. CCPC shares are also called qualified small business corporation shares because they may qualify for a capital gains exemption. There are specific rules that set out how a company may qualify for a capital gains exemption, but these rules are beyond the scope of this discussion. 8.2.3.2 Capital gains exemption \u00b6 For the purpose of this Module, the most important tax attribute of a CCPC is that, upon actual or deemed disposition, the shares may be eligible for the lifetime capital gains exemption (LCGE). The LCGE for a CCPC is currently set at $883,384 for 2020 and is to be indexed annually for inflation. A taxpayer can use the LCGE to eliminate or offset capital gains realized upon the disposition of qualified shares in a CCPC, a family farm or a family fishing business. The formula is: (Capital gain \u2013 LCGE) \u00d7 50% = taxable capital gain Example Gene was the sole shareholder of his sportswear manufacturing company, Kiliman, which is a CCPC. When he died, the business had a fair market value (FMV) of $2,400,000 and an adjusted cost base (ACB) of $200,000. He left the business to his daughter, Yvonne. This deemed disposition resulted in a capital gain of $2,200,000. Capital gain = $2,400,000 \u2013 $200,000 = $2,200,000 Gene has never made use of the LCGE, so $883,384 (in 2020) of this capital gain is exempt from tax, leaving his estate with a taxable capital gain of $658,308. Taxable capital gain = ( $2,200,000 \u2013 $883,384) \u00d7 50% = $658,308 If Gene\u2019s marginal tax rate for the year of death was 45%, this would result in a tax liability of $296,239. Tax liability with LCGE = $658,308 \u00d7 45% = $296,239 However, if he had not been able to take advantage of the LCGE, the tax liability would have been $495,000. Tax liability without LCGE = $2,200,000 \u00d7 50% \u00d7 45% = $495,000 8.3 \u201cKey person\u201d life insurance \u00b6 Earlier we reviewed the concept of a \u201ckey person\u201d in a small business and the potential negative impact if a key person dies unexpectedly. In order to protect against those negative consequences, a company can insure its key person. In this case, the company receives the death benefit. Example A1 Industries has a salesperson, Elaine, who is a star. She alone is responsible for over 60% of revenues. A1 takes out a life policy on Elaine naming itself as beneficiary. If Elaine died while a key person for A1 Industries, A1 could use the money to replace her and/or shore up revenues during the search for her replacement. 8.3.1 Split-dollar arrangements \u00b6 A split-dollar arrangement is a method of sharing the cost and benefits of life insurance between two parties, such as a corporation and its key person. Typically, the agreement is between two parties and is used when more than one person or entity requires the benefits that can be provided by a life insurance policy. In common split-dollar arrangements, a life insurance policy could be jointly owned by a key employee and the corporation for which they work. The specific arrangement could be structured in several different ways. For example, the employee could own the death benefit while the company owns and controls the cash value of the policy or vice-versa. If it is a UL policy, the corporation could own the face amount and the key person own the death benefit greater than the original face amount; which would be paid to a beneficiary of the key person upon the death of the key employee. Alternatively, the corporation could own the death benefit up to the original face amount while the employee owns the policy\u2019s cash value and any death benefit in excess of the original face amount. This is a most common arrangement for key person insurance, as it provides the corporation with access to the death benefit in the event of the death of the key person while the employee is able to benefit from a tax-deferred investment vehicle. Each party to a split-dollar arrangement pays a portion of the premiums in a way that recognizes their separate economic interests in the policy. In the final example, in which the corporation owns the death benefit up to the original face amount, the company\u2019s share of premiums will be tied to the reasonable cost of comparable term insurance coverage, while the employee pays the balance of the premium costs. 8.3.1.1 Taxation of key person split-dollar arrangements \u00b6 There are no formal Income Tax rules governing split-dollar arrangements. The administrative practice of Canada Revenue Agency has been to recognize the premium allocation between the employee and the corporation as a reflection of the fair market value of their respective interests in the insurance contract. Upon retirement or termination of employment, the ownership interest in the death benefit could be transferred to the departing employee. Depending on the fair market value (FMV) of the policy, the transfer might result in a taxable benefit for the employee. If the policy is surrendered, the employee would have to report a policy gain for the difference between the cash surrender value (CSV) and the employee\u2019s adjusted cost base (ACB) in the policy. 8.3.2 As a requirement for borrowing \u00b6 If the success of a business depends on the involvement of a key person, a lender may be reluctant to loan money to a business without the assurance of key person insurance. Key person insurance may have to be assigned to the financial institution providing the loan. Death of the key person would result in a death benefit paid to the lender in the sum of the loan. If a business acquires key person insurance because a lender requires it, the business can deduct from its income: The cost of premiums if a term policy is used; The net cost of pure insurance if a permanent policy is used. 8.4 Buy-sell agreements \u00b6 A buy-sell agreement specifies what happens in a business with multiple owners if one owner dies. Important details for consideration are: Who can\u2014or must\u2014buy the deceased owner\u2019s interest; The cost of that interest or how the cost will be determined; How to pay for the deceased owner\u2019s interest. Buy-sell agreements can also specify how a buyout is structured if an owner wants to leave the business, retires or becomes disabled. 8.4.1 Cross-purchase agreements \u00b6 With a cross-purchase buy-sell agreement, the other owners agree to buy the interest of a deceased owner. For a corporation, this means that the total number of shares outstanding and the value of those shares remain the same, but each surviving shareholder now owns a greater number of shares. Example Bob, Calvin and Dylan are the three shareholders of a small incorporated business specializing in recycling paper. They each own 100 shares, which are currently worth $10,000 per share. They recently entered into a buy-sell agreement which says that, if any one of them dies, the survivors will buy his shares for their current share value as determined by the company\u2019s financial statements. If Bob dies today, this means that Calvin and Dylan will each buy 50 shares from his estate at a price of $10,000 per share. Bob\u2019s estate will receive a total of $1,000,000, and Calvin and Dylan will now each own 150 shares. The total number of shares outstanding is still 300, but Calvin and Dylan now have a 50% interest, instead of the 33.33% ownership interest that they had before Bob\u2019s death. With a share redemption plan, the corporation buys the shares of the deceased owner. This reduces the number of shares outstanding, but the survivors\u2019 ownership interests increase. Example Emily, Fatima and Gloria are the three shareholders of a small incorporated business specializing in health products called Forest Air. They each own 100 shares, which are currently worth $10,000 per share. They recently entered into a buy-sell agreement in the form of a share redemption plan with the company which says that, if any one of them dies, the company will redeem her shares for their current value as determined by the company\u2019s financial statements and will cancel shares redeemed by the company of which the total will be 200. If Emily dies today, this means that the company will pay $1,000,000 to her estate. Fatima and Gloria will still own 100 shares each, but because the number of outstanding shares will drop to just 200, they will now each have a 50% interest in the company, instead of the 33.33% ownership interest that they had before Emily\u2019s death. 8.4.2 Why buy-sell agreements are important \u00b6 A buy-sell agreement is essential among business owners to protect the business, other owners, and beneficiaries if one or more of the owners dies unexpectedly. A properly funded buy-sell agreement protects the surviving owners, the business, and the beneficiaries of the deceased owner. The critical elements of a buy-sell agreement are discussed below. 8.4.2.1 Guaranteed buyer \u00b6 A buy-sell agreement guarantees a sale of the shares - usually to surviving owners or the business itself. 8.4.2.2 Guaranteed value \u00b6 The price at which the sale is transacted is also guaranteed by the agreement. This is fair to the inheriting owner of the shares and prevents a \u201cfire sale\u201d in which the share price is deeply discounted simply to attract a buyer. 8.4.2.3 Mandatory sale \u00b6 A buy-sell agreement protects surviving owners from the unknown. Survivors know they will receive the shares of the deceased. With a buy-sell agreement, the estate must either sell the shares to the company itself (in a share redemption plan), or to the surviving owners (in a cross-purchase agreement). 8.4.2.4 Guaranteed funding through life insurance \u00b6 Life insurance provides an absolutely secure method of funding the purchase of shares from the estate of a deceased owner. How life insurance is used is described in the following sections. 8.4.3 Criss-cross insurance \u00b6 An arrangement known as \u201ccriss-cross insurance\u201d is often used to fund cross-purchase buy-sell agreements. With a criss-cross arrangement, each party to the buy-sell agreement buys life insurance on the other parties to the agreement, in an amount sufficient to cover their purchase obligation upon that party\u2019s death. Example Recall the earlier example where Bob, Calvin and Dylan each own 100 shares, which are currently worth $10,000 per share. They recently executed a buy-sell agreement which says that, if any one of them dies, the survivors will buy his shares for their current share value as determined by the company\u2019s financial statements. The agreement specifies that each associate will purchase life insurance on the lives of the other parties. So Bob would buy $500,000 of life insurance on Calvin and Dylan, which would be sufficient to buy 50 shares at the current value of $10,000 per share. Bob is the youngest of the three owners. He is only 32 years old and in excellent health. Dylan, however, is 54 years old, overweight and a smoker, with a history of hypertension. Bob will pay much more for $500,000 of coverage on Dylan\u2019s life than Dylan will pay for $500,000 of coverage on Bob\u2019s life. Bob doesn\u2019t think this is fair, considering the fact that the death benefit is the same for both of them. Dylan, however, maintains that it is fair because Bob is far more likely to collect on the insurance than he is. Because the insurance is not being used to secure a loan for business or investment purposes, the premiums are not deductible to either the associates or the business. However, the death benefit is tax-free. One of the disadvantages of criss-cross insurance is that there may be significant differences in the premiums for the coverage required on each party, depending on their age and health. Example Jack and Alfred each own 50% of the 200 shares of Jackal Inc., a frozen dessert company. They implemented a buy-sell agreement funded with criss-cross insurance. Jack died shortly thereafter. The overall process would look like this: From a tax perspective, the deceased owner is deemed to have disposed of his business interest for its fair market value (FMV) just prior to death. This will trigger a capital gain on the deceased\u2019s final tax return, unless he can shelter some or all of the capital gain with the lifetime capital gains exemption (LCGE) available for qualifying small business shares. The LCGE for 2020 is $883,384. The surviving associate(s) use the tax-free death benefit they received when the owner died in order to acquire the units or shares from his estate. Example (Cont.) Jack and Alfred pay the premiums for life insurance on each other. Jack dies, and his 100 shares transfer to his estate. The insurance company pays a tax-free death benefit to Alfred. Alfred pays Jack\u2019s estate for his 100 shares. Jack\u2019s estate transfers the 100 shares to Alfred, who now owns all 200 shares, or 100% of the company. 8.4.4 Business-owned insurance \u00b6 Instead of the criss-cross arrangement, the business could buy life insurance on its owners. It will be the policy beneficiary. This arrangement has several potential benefits over policies purchased by the individual owners, as follows: When the business is the owner of the policies, it will be clear to all owners that premiums are being paid. The business pays tax at a lower rate than individuals, plus individuals are saved the premium expense. If there are more than two owners, it will generally be more efficient and more cost-effective for the business to own policies on each associate, compared to each owner purchasing policies on the other owners. If the cost of insuring each associate varies significantly between the associates (due to reasons such as age and health status), a business-owned option will ensure that the costs are shared equally. Note that if a buy-sell agreement will be funded by business-owned insurance and there are only two owners, a joint first-to-die policy may be appropriate. 8.4.4.1 Role of the capital dividend account (CDA) \u00b6 Business-owned insurance can be used to fund both cross-purchase buy-sell agreements and share redemption plans. In order to understand how business-owned insurance can be an effective business strategy, it is first necessary to understand how the Capital Dividend Account works. The capital dividend account is a notional account, which only keeps track of inputs and outputs for tax purposes. A private corporation uses its CDA to record amounts it receives on a tax-free basis, such as the tax-free 50% of capital gains and some or all of the death benefits received from a life insurance policy. When the account has a positive balance, the corporation can pay a tax-free capital dividend to its shareholders. When the corporation pays out a capital dividend, the CDA balance is reduced by the same amount. Note that only the portion of the death benefit that exceeds the policy\u2019s ACB is credited to the CDA, and ultimately paid out as a tax-free capital dividend. The remainder (i.e., an amount equal to the policy\u2019s ACB) is taxable to the corporation. In the case of a term policy, the ACB is zero, which means that the full death benefit can be credited to the CDA. However, for whole life or UL policies, a portion of the death benefit equal to the policy\u2019s ACB is in fact taxable to the corporation. Recall from Section G2 and G3 policies that the ACB of G3 policies tends to grow faster than for G2 policies in the early years, and it takes longer for that ACB to reduce to zero. This ACB pattern is beneficial for individual policyholders who surrender their policies prior to death of the life insured because it reduces their policy gain. However, it is less favourable for corporate-owned policies because a greater portion of the death benefit ends up being taxable. 8.4.4.2 Funding cross-purchase buy-sell agreements \u00b6 If a cross-purchase agreement is funded by corporate-owned insurance, usually the corporation is named as the beneficiary of the policy. When one shareholder dies, the surviving owner(s) purchase the shares from his estate, often using a promissory note. The insurance company will pay the death benefit to the corpora-tion, which will credit the amount to its capital dividend account. The surviving shareholder(s) will then direct the corporation to pay them a capital dividend, which they will use to pay off the promissory note. Example (cont.) Suppose Jack and Alfred\u2019s cross-purchase agreement is instead funded by insurance owned by Jackal Inc. If Jack died shortly thereafter, the overall process would look like this: Example (Cont.) Jackal Inc. pays the premiums for insurance on both Jack and Alfred. Jack dies, and his 100 shares transfer to his estate. The insurance company pays the tax-free death benefit to Jackal Inc., which is credited to its CDA. Alfred pays Jack\u2019s estate for his 100 shares with a promissory note. Jack\u2019s estate transfers the 100 shares to Alfred, who now owns all 200 shares, or 100% of Jackal Inc. Alfred instructs Jackal Inc. to pay him a tax-free capital dividend. Alfred uses these funds to pay off the promissory note. 8.4.4.3 Funding share-redemption buy-sell agreements \u00b6 In the case of a share redemption plan, the company and the shareholders are all parties to the buy-sell agreement. The company buys life insurance on all of the shareholders, naming itself as the beneficiary. When one of the owners dies, the company uses the death benefit to redeem the shares from the deceased shareholder\u2019s estate. Example (cont.) Suppose that Jack and Alfred instead entered into a buy-sell agreement with Jackal Inc., structured as a share redemption plan, funded by insurance owned by Jackal Inc. When Jack died shortly thereafter, the overall process would look like this: Jackal Inc. pays the premiums for insurance on both Jack and Alfred. Jack dies, and his shares transfer to his estate. The insurance company pays the tax-free death benefit to Jackal Inc., which is credited to its CDA. Jackal Inc. uses the funds to redeem the shares from Jack\u2019s estate, cancelling the said shares, reduc-ing the number of shares outstanding to 100. Alfred still owns the remaining 100 shares, which represents 100% of the company.","title":"Chapter 8 Business Life Insurance"},{"location":"life/Chapter_8_Business_Life_Insurance/#chapter-8-business-life-insurance","text":"","title":"Chapter 8: BUSINESS LIFE INSURANCE"},{"location":"life/Chapter_8_Business_Life_Insurance/#81-potential-impacts-of-death-on-a-business","text":"While death is often thought of as a purely personal event, unexpected or premature death can also have a devastating impact on some businesses \u2013 especially small and start-up businesses that are dependent on their employees for their continued success.

Death of a key employee can bring about the collapse of a business if revenues decline as a result of the death.

To continue the example, Farid never revealed any details about the business to Gohar, who expects dividends to be paid quarterly. However, if dividends are paid quarterly, money will not be available in the business to buy more inventory. Without inventory, the business will be ruined. An inheritor may be willing to sell their newly acquired share of the business but at a selling price that is unreasonable and unrealistic for the other owners to pay. To continue the example, Gohar may be willing to sell the share of the business she inherited from Farid. However, with no knowledge of the business, she sets a price that is too high. The remaining shareholders refuse to meet her price. Family hostility ensues.

Shares have value and an adjusted cost base that can lead to a capital gain or loss when they are sold.

The LCGE for a CCPC is currently set at $883,384 for 2020 and is to be indexed annually for inflation. A taxpayer can use the LCGE to eliminate or offset capital gains realized upon the disposition of qualified shares in a CCPC, a family farm or a family fishing business. The formula is: (Capital gain \u2013 LCGE) \u00d7 50% = taxable capital gain Example Gene was the sole shareholder of his sportswear manufacturing company, Kiliman, which is a CCPC. When he died, the business had a fair market value (FMV) of $2,400,000 and an adjusted cost base (ACB) of $200,000. He left the business to his daughter, Yvonne.

Typically, the agreement is between two parties and is used when more than one person or entity requires the benefits that can be provided by a life insurance policy. In common split-dollar arrangements, a life insurance policy could be jointly owned by a key employee and the corporation for which they work. The specific arrangement could be structured in several different ways. For example, the employee could own the death benefit while the company owns and controls the cash value of the policy or vice-versa. If it is a UL policy, the corporation could own the face amount and the key person own the death benefit greater than the original face amount; which would be paid to a beneficiary of the key person upon the death of the key employee. Alternatively, the corporation could own the death benefit up to the original face amount while the employee owns the policy\u2019s cash value and any death benefit in excess of the original face amount. This is a most common arrangement for key person insurance, as it provides the corporation with access to the death benefit in the event of the death of the key person while the employee is able to benefit from a tax-deferred investment vehicle. Each party to a split-dollar arrangement pays a portion of the premiums in a way that recognizes their separate economic interests in the policy. In the final example, in which the corporation owns the death benefit up to the original face amount, the company\u2019s share of premiums will be tied to the reasonable cost of comparable term insurance coverage, while the employee pays the balance of the premium costs.","title":"8.3.1 Split-dollar arrangements"},{"location":"life/Chapter_8_Business_Life_Insurance/#8311-taxation-of-key-person-split-dollar-arrangements","text":"There are no formal Income Tax rules governing split-dollar arrangements.

Depending on the fair market value (FMV) of the policy, the transfer might result in a taxable benefit for the employee.

With a criss-cross arrangement, each party to the buy-sell agreement buys life insurance on the other parties to the agreement, in an amount sufficient to cover their purchase obligation upon that party\u2019s death. Example Recall the earlier example where Bob, Calvin and Dylan each own 100 shares, which are currently worth $10,000 per share. They recently executed a buy-sell agreement which says that, if any one of them dies, the survivors will buy his shares for their current share value as determined by the company\u2019s financial statements. The agreement specifies that each associate will purchase life insurance on the lives of the other parties. So Bob would buy $500,000 of life insurance on Calvin and Dylan, which would be sufficient to buy 50 shares at the current value of $10,000 per share. Bob is the youngest of the three owners. He is only 32 years old and in excellent health. Dylan, however, is 54 years old, overweight and a smoker, with a history of hypertension. Bob will pay much more for $500,000 of coverage on Dylan\u2019s life than Dylan will pay for $500,000 of coverage on Bob\u2019s life. Bob doesn\u2019t think this is fair, considering the fact that the death benefit is the same for both of them. Dylan, however, maintains that it is fair because Bob is far more likely to collect on the insurance than he is. Because the insurance is not being used to secure a loan for business or investment purposes, the premiums are not deductible to either the associates or the business. However, the death benefit is tax-free. One of the disadvantages of criss-cross insurance is that there may be significant differences in the premiums for the coverage required on each party, depending on their age and health. Example Jack and Alfred each own 50% of the 200 shares of Jackal Inc., a frozen dessert company. They implemented a buy-sell agreement funded with criss-cross insurance. Jack died shortly thereafter. The overall process would look like this: From a tax perspective, the deceased owner is deemed to have disposed of his business interest for its fair market value (FMV) just prior to death. This will trigger a capital gain on the deceased\u2019s final tax return, unless he can shelter some or all of the capital gain with the lifetime capital gains exemption (LCGE) available for qualifying small business shares. The LCGE for 2020 is $883,384. The surviving associate(s) use the tax-free death benefit they received when the owner died in order to acquire the units or shares from his estate. Example (Cont.) Jack and Alfred pay the premiums for life insurance on each other. Jack dies, and his 100 shares transfer to his estate. The insurance company pays a tax-free death benefit to Alfred. Alfred pays Jack\u2019s estate for his 100 shares. Jack\u2019s estate transfers the 100 shares to Alfred, who now owns all 200 shares, or 100% of the company.","title":"8.4.3 Criss-cross insurance"},{"location":"life/Chapter_8_Business_Life_Insurance/#844-business-owned-insurance","text":"Instead of the criss-cross arrangement, the business could buy life insurance on its owners.

This arrangement has several potential benefits over policies purchased by the individual owners, as follows: When the business is the owner of the policies, it will be clear to all owners that premiums are being paid. The business pays tax at a lower rate than individuals, plus individuals are saved the premium expense. If there are more than two owners, it will generally be more efficient and more cost-effective for the business to own policies on each associate, compared to each owner purchasing policies on the other owners. If the cost of insuring each associate varies significantly between the associates (due to reasons such as age and health status), a business-owned option will ensure that the costs are shared equally. Note that if a buy-sell agreement will be funded by business-owned insurance and there are only two owners, a joint first-to-die policy may be appropriate.","title":"8.4.4 Business-owned insurance"},{"location":"life/Chapter_8_Business_Life_Insurance/#8441-role-of-the-capital-dividend-account-cda","text":"Business-owned insurance can be used to fund both cross-purchase buy-sell agreements and share redemption plans. In order to understand how business-owned insurance can be an effective business strategy, it is first necessary to understand how the Capital Dividend Account works. The capital dividend account is a notional account, which only keeps track of inputs and outputs for tax purposes. A private corporation uses its CDA to record amounts it receives on a tax-free basis, such as the tax-free 50% of capital gains and some or all of the death benefits received from a life insurance policy. When the account has a positive balance, the corporation can pay a tax-free capital dividend to its shareholders. When the corporation pays out a capital dividend, the CDA balance is reduced by the same amount. Note that only the portion of the death benefit that exceeds the policy\u2019s ACB is credited to the CDA, and ultimately paid out as a tax-free capital dividend. The remainder (i.e., an amount equal to the policy\u2019s ACB) is taxable to the corporation. In the case of a term policy, the ACB is zero, which means that the full death benefit can be credited to the CDA. However, for whole life or UL policies, a portion of the death benefit equal to the policy\u2019s ACB is in fact taxable to the corporation. Recall from Section G2 and G3 policies that the ACB of G3 policies tends to grow faster than for G2 policies in the early years, and it takes longer for that ACB to reduce to zero. This ACB pattern is beneficial for individual policyholders who surrender their policies prior to death of the life insured because it reduces their policy gain. However, it is less favourable for corporate-owned policies because a greater portion of the death benefit ends up being taxable.","title":"8.4.4.1 Role of the capital dividend account (CDA)"},{"location":"life/Chapter_8_Business_Life_Insurance/#8442-funding-cross-purchase-buy-sell-agreements","text":"If a cross-purchase agreement is funded by corporate-owned insurance, usually the corporation is named as the beneficiary of the policy.

The surviving shareholder(s) will then direct the corporation to pay them a capital dividend, which they will use to pay off the promissory note. Example (cont.)

It is the process by which the insurance company determines whether it will accept the risk and issue the policy, and, if so, the premium that needs to be charged to insure that risk. As a general rule, the higher the risk presented by the life insurance applicant, the higher the premiums that will be charged to insure the risk. Underwriting is completed at head office level but agent insights and observations are important to underwriters. The agent is sometimes called the \u201ceyes of the insurance company\u201d as typically only the agent will have face-to-face contact with the insurance applicant. Underwriting is completed for both personal and group policies. 9.1.1 Agent\u2019s role \u00b6 The agent collects some of the information needed to assess the risk. That information is supplemented by other sources consulted by the underwriter. 9.1.2 Completing the application \u00b6 The agent ensures: Information on the application is complete and accurate; The applicant understands what will happen if information is incomplete or inaccurate; The identity of the applicant and life insured is as stated by comparing name, date of birth, and appearance against government-issued ID; Signatures are true by witnessing the signatures on the application. The application is complete when all information needed has been provided, and the application is signed by the applicant and witnessed by the agent. The agent\u2019s role in helping the client complete the application is sometimes referred to as \u201cfield underwriting.\u201d 9.1.3 Underwriting \u00b6 The completed application is sent to the underwriting department. The underwriter initially assigns the life insured the mortality risk of an average person. Application and Underwriting The underwriter then compares the life insured against many medical, financial, and lifestyle criteria. The purpose of the comparison is to assign the life insured to the most appropriate risk class. If the comparison shows the life insured has a low mortality risk, and their application is for a standard amount of insurance, then a policy is usually issued quickly. If the comparison shows the life insured has a higher mortality risk, or their application is for a non-standard amount of insurance, then a decision about whether a policy will be issued is not made until additional information can be assessed. 9.1.4 Issuing and delivering the policy \u00b6 The agent personally delivers the policy to the policyholder. The agent continues the underwriting process by ensuring the medical, personal, and financial status of the policyholder and life insured have not changed since the application was made. The agent must not deliver the policy if there is any indication of a change between application and delivery. 9.2 Application \u00b6 The agent helps the applicant to complete the application. Spending time with the applicant may reveal aspects of the individual that are not apparent from the written form. The agent will want to share any information that can affect the risk assessment with the underwriter. 9.2.1 Policy details \u00b6 An application typically begins with the type of coverage the applicant wants to receive. 9.2.1.1 Applicant/policyholder \u00b6 The applicant is the person who wants to buy the policy, and who will be the future policyholder if the policy is issued. When the applicant will not be the life insured, the name of a contingent or successor owner is required. This owner becomes the policyholder if the original policyholder dies. 9.2.1.2 Life insured \u00b6 The applicant must identify a specific person as the life insured. An applicant may or may not be the same person as the life insured but in most cases, the applicant will also be the life insured. A joint life policy names two life insureds and must further specify whether the death benefit will be paid when one dies (that is, a joint first-to-die policy) or on the death of the second (that is, a joint last-to-die policy). 9.2.1.3 Beneficiary \u00b6 The beneficiary receives the death benefit when the life insured dies. The beneficiary can be the applicant, any other individual, a group of people, a trust, a business, or a charity. Note that the applicant may only be the beneficiary if they are not the life insured. When a beneficiary is not named, proceeds are paid to the estate of the policyholder. A contingent beneficiary can be named who would receive the death benefit if the original beneficiary has died. Beneficiaries can be changed by making a written request to the insurer. The exception is when the beneficiary is irrevocable. An irrevocable beneficiary cannot be replaced unless the beneficiary gives their permission to be replaced. Sometimes an irrevocable beneficiary designation is required to comply with a court order for the child or spousal support. 9.2.1.4 Type of policy \u00b6 One application may serve for many types of policies. The UL applicant may have additional choices to make on the application to select how mortality deductions will be calculated (for example, yearly renewable term or level cost of insurance) and how the death benefit is calculated (such as whether the account value is to be received at death). Both UL and whole life applicants will usually be provided with a document that contains an illustration of policy benefits: UL sales illustrations project values for the deposits, mortality charges, investment account value, and cash surrender value and death benefit for each future year; Whole life illustrations for participating policies project dividends. The illustration that corresponds to the application must be attached to the application and signed by the applicant to demonstrate that the applicant has been shown how the policy works. 9.2.1.5 Riders and supplementary benefits \u00b6 If the insurance company allows policyholders to select additional riders and supplementary benefits (such as a family coverage rider), these additional riders and benefits are also selected on the application form. Typically, additional riders and benefits may only be selected when the policy is issued. 9.2.1.6 Premium options \u00b6 The payment schedule must be selected for premiums; monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually. 9.2.1.7 Dividend options \u00b6 Par whole life policyholders have a choice as to how dividends will be received. This choice is made on the application between: Cash; Premium reduction; Accumulation; Paid-up additions; Term insurance. 9.2.2 About the applicant \u00b6 The attention of the insurance company focuses on the applicant for their: Ability to pay premiums; Named insurable interest; Justification for the amount of coverage; History of insurance applications. 9.2.2.1 Financial ability \u00b6 To be assured the applicant can afford the premiums, the application may request details on the applicant\u2019s: Occupation (or prior occupation if retired); Employer; Income from all sources; Net worth (i.e., the applicant\u2019s assets minus their liabilities). 9.2.2.2 Insurable interest \u00b6 An insurable interest is a policy requirement. It exists when the death of the life insured will cause the policyholder to suffer a financial loss, or fail to make a financial gain. Therefore, the policyholder needs to have an insurable interest in the life insured. An insurable interest is created by: A policyholder who is also the life insured, and who will suffer a financial loss by their own death. Therefore, they have an insurable interest in their own life; The lives of a policyholder\u2019s spouse, child or grandchild, employee, person who financially supported by the policyholder, or anyone else in whom the policyholder has a financial (or \u201cpecuniary\u201d) interest; Anyone who consents in writing to the insurance on their life. Note that the insurable interest must only be present at the time the policy is issued. If the relationship between the policyholder and the life insured changes such that the insurable interest no longer exists, the contract is still valid. Example 1 When Isabelle and her husband Justin had their first child, Justin bought a $500,000 20-year term life insurance policy on Isabelle\u2019s life. Isabelle and Justin divorced a few years later and Isabelle has since remarried. Justin no longer has an insurable interest in Isabelle\u2019s life; the existing policy remains valid, but Justin would likely not be able to buy any additional coverage on Isabelle\u2019s life. Example 2 Justin\u2019s next door neighbour, Caleb, is an adventurous person who has a passion for extreme sports and travel. When Justin heard that Caleb was planning to go on a solo snowmobile expedition to the North Pole, Justin joked that he should buy life insurance on Caleb\u2019s life. However, Justin does not have an insurable interest in Caleb\u2019s life, so the only way he could buy insurance on his life would be to obtain Caleb\u2019s written consent. 9.2.2.3 Justification of amount of coverage \u00b6 Insurance is intended to restore the person who has suffered a financial loss due to death to the position they would otherwise enjoy if death had not occurred. Insurance is not intended to provide a way for the person to profit from the death of the life insured. The amount of coverage must be reasonable for the circumstances of the policyholder and beneficiary. Example Frank and Susan are both 30 years old, and they have 3 children, all under the age of 5 years old. Susan stays home to care for the children while Frank earns a salary of $250,000 per year. They have a $350,000 mortgage with a 20-year amortization. Another couple, Jack and Jolene, are 46 and 42 years old, and they do not have children. Jack earns $40,000 and Jolene earns $25,000. They rent their home and have no major debts. Susan and Jolene both applied for $7.5 million of life insurance coverage on their husbands. In all likelihood, the underwriters would consider $7.5 million of coverage on Jack\u2019s life to be excessive, and they would refuse to issue a policy for that amount. However, they would likely agree that the amount is reasonable in Susan\u2019s case, considering Frank\u2019s income and young age, Susan\u2019s lack of income, their mortgage debt and the fact that they have three young children who require ongoing support. 9.2.2.4 Insurance application history \u00b6 Underwriters will also consider other policies that exist or for which an application has been made. This ensures the total amount of coverage is reasonable. 9.2.3 About the life insured \u00b6 The risk to the insurance company stems from the health of the life insured, as well as any activities that might result in death. As a result, the insurance application is designed to gather as much information about the life insured as possible. 9.2.3.1 Personal information \u00b6 Personal details about the life insured needed to complete the application include: Name and any former name, such as a maiden name; Date of birth; Address; Social insurance number; Country of birth; Nationality or immigration status; Employer and occupation; and Details of any bankruptcy. Lifestyle questions about the life insured include: Hobbies, interests, and sports participation; Travel, past and future plans; Smoking habits including tobacco products, marijuana and its derivatives, and smoking substitutes; Alcohol and drug use; Driving history; and Criminal charges and convictions. 9.2.3.2 Medical information \u00b6 Health details involve information about conditions, treatments, medications, family health history, and previous pregnancies. Questions require a yes-or-no answer; yes answers lead to more in-depth questioning. The following information will also be taken: Height and weight; Personal doctor\u2019s name; Most recent medical consultation, its reason and outcome. Example When Rebekah was filling out her life insurance application, she answered \u201cYes\u201d to the question that asked, \u201cHave you ever had or been investigated or treated for conditions involving your heart or blood vessels?\u201d because she had once visited the emergency room complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. Later in the application, she was asked to provide details about the incident, including the name of the hospital and attending doctor, the types of tests he performed and the diagnosis. 9.2.4 Incomplete or erroneous information \u00b6 Truthful answers must be provided or the policy can be voided. Material facts are facts that affect underwriting. 9.2.4.1 Mistake \u00b6 Mistakes may occur inadvertently through a misunderstanding or carelessness. A material mistake can lead to the policy being voided during its first two years after the issue or reinstatement: For example, inadvertently confusing months and days (that is, writing 03/06 instead of 06/03) is unlikely to affect underwriting; However, misstating age by years would affect underwriting. If two years pass without discovering the mistake, the policy stands as being incontestable unless fraud has been committed. Example Christina recently filled out a life insurance application. The application accidentally listed her birth year as 1954 instead of 1945. This mistake is material because the risk of death increases significantly as the life insured ages. When it asked her to specify her most recent visit to a physician, she listed her annual checkup that occurred nine months ago. She forgot to mention that she met with her physician three months ago to get a flu shot. This mistake is not material because getting a flu shot is unlikely to impact the underwriter\u2019s evaluation. 9.2.4.2 Fraudulent misrepresentation \u00b6 Fraud occurs when false information is provided to intentionally misrepresent the life insured in order to receive a policy, or receive a policy with a higher death benefit or lower premium. When fraud is discovered, the policy is void even if the two-year contestability window has passed. Smoking is one habit that applicants persistently lie about. If discovered the life insurance company may: Void the policy and refund premiums paid; Adjust premiums or the death benefit to reflect what is accurate given the smoking habit. Example When Eric was travelling in Peru several years ago, he contracted a parasite that left him seriously ill. After spending several days being treated in hospital, he was discharged with a prescription for more antibiotics and was told that he should follow up with his family doctor when he returned home because there could be long-term complications, including organ damage. Eric recovered quickly and he never bothered to see his family doctor. When he later filled out a life insurance application, he knew he had some health issues that might concern the insurance company and that could result in higher premiums. He purposely neglected to disclose the incident in Peru; he decided that because it happened outside the country and he paid for it out of pocket, there was no way the insurance company could find out about it. Three years later, Eric suffered sudden liver failure and died during surgery. The liver damage was eventually linked to his experience with the parasite in Peru. Because Eric made a fraudulent material misrepresentation, the insurance company was able to void the policy even though the two-year contestability period had passed, and they did not pay the death benefit. 9.2.4.3 Incomplete information \u00b6 A policy application must be complete. If it is not, the underwriter will return the application. Policy issue will be delayed. 9.2.5 Agent\u2019s comments \u00b6 Agents are encouraged to comment on the applicant and life insured from their personal knowledge or observations. 9.3 Temporary insurance agreement (TIA) \u00b6 A temporary insurance agreement (TIA) provides insurance coverage while the policy is being underwritten. The agent issues the TIA. There is no guarantee a TIA will be issued. 9.3.1 Requirements for coverage \u00b6 The TIA requires: The policy application to be completed; A minimum of one month\u2019s premium; Completion of a separate TIA application; A negative (\u201cno\u201d) answer to a short list of health questions on the TIA application; The life insured to be in the approved age range (roughly 15 days of age to 70 years of age). 9.3.2 Coverage limits \u00b6 Coverage of the TIA is typically limited to the lesser of: A fixed dollar amount; The policy face amount. Suicide is excluded from coverage. 9.3.3 Coverage duration \u00b6 Coverage begins as soon as the application is completed or when medical proof is provided. The TIA remains in force until the earliest of: The date it expires (usually 60 to 90 days after the issue); The date the actual policy takes effect; The date notification is received by the applicant that their application has been denied by the insurance company; The date the underwriter decides the TIA must be revoked and informs the applicant in writing. The premium that accompanied the application is returned if the application is denied. 9.3.4 Agent\u2019s responsibilities \u00b6 An agent must not issue a TIA if: The agent believes the policy itself will not be issued; The premium is not provided with the application; The agent\u2019s observations lead to any doubt about the insurability of the life insured at standard rates. The underwriter who is processing the application may also revoke the TIA by advising the applicant in writing and returning the premium. Example Richard is a life agent and he has just helped Arlene complete an application for life insurance. Arlene is diabetic and has high blood pressure. She admitted that she smokes regularly and Richard noticed that she had a persistent cough, which he duly noted in the Agent\u2019s Comments section of the application. Given the concerns about Arlene\u2019s health, Richard should not issue a temporary insurance agreement. 9.4 Underwriting by the insurance company \u00b6 Once the insurance company receives a completed application, its underwriter begins the task of evaluating the risks posed by the life insured. 9.4.1 Underwriting guidelines \u00b6 Each insurance company has its own guidelines for underwriting. The guidelines establish standards and set out key elements that must be considered. When the standards are not met, usually more information is needed to assess the risk. For example, Claude is defined as morbidly obese according to the weight tables for standard risk. Claude may be required to undergo medical exams to substantiate his insurability for the amount of insurance he is applying for. The insurance company may have separate guidelines for medical, non-medical and financial underwriting. Agents may find it helpful to review the guidelines so they can help clients set realistic expectations about the outcome of their application. Example Chandra is a life insurance agent and he recently helped his client, Jeannine, complete an application for life insurance. He noticed that she reported a family history of diabetes and that she had recently lost a substantial amount of weight. Because he was familiar with the insurance company\u2019s underwriting guidelines, he was able to tell her that it was highly likely that the underwriters would request more information and require her to submit to a medical exam. He also warned her that she might not qualify for standard rates and that there was even a possibility that the underwriters would reject her application. 9.4.2 Attending physician\u2019s statement (APS) \u00b6 An APS is provided by the personal physician of the life insured upon request by an underwriter. The insurance company contacts the physician and pays any fees for the statement. The physician returns the completed APS to the insurance company. The APS is a more detailed record of medical history, current health, and future health expectations. It usually addresses a specific medical problem or condition. 9.4.3 Medical exam \u00b6 The underwriter may request a medical exam, especially if a large amount of insurance coverage is being applied for or if the life insured is older. The exam may include a range of physical tests, depending on indicators. For example, suspected drug use may lead to the request for a urine test; heart problems may call for an electrocardiogram. The insurance company pays for all tests, regardless of who performs them. Usually, the medical exam is performed by a medical practitioner who works for an independent paramedical company. For high-value policies or if there are complex medical concerns, the underwriter may require the exam to be performed by a licensed physician or may order special tests, such as a cardiac stress test. 9.4.4 Medical Information Bureau (MIB) \u00b6 The MIB exchanges medical information about applicants between insurance companies. The MIB is a membership of insurance companies, and most life insurance companies in Canada and the U.S. choose to belong to the MIB. An applicant must give permission for their information to be shared with the MIB. When someone applies for life insurance at a MIB-member company, they must be informed about the nature of the MIB and they must also sign a release that authorizes the insurance company to search for information about them on the MIB and to share any applicable details of their application with the MIB. An underwriter reports medical and non-medical issues to the MIB, where they are coded and stored. The MIB makes that information available to future underwriters when the same applicant applies for another policy or policies. MIB data can lead to an underwriter requesting substantiating information from a doctor or other sources; the MIB data in isolation cannot be the reason to deny a claim or apply a higher (rated) premium. Example Ernie was living in Ontario when he applied for life insurance with ABC Insurance Co. last year. On his application, he indicated that he had previously experienced a heart attack and had two related surgeries. He was also a heavy smoker and overweight. His application was declined. This year Ernie moved to Alberta and again applied for life insurance with XYZ Insurance Co. This time, he decided not to mention any of his heart problems, thinking that his health records would not be transferred between provinces. Also, he claimed to smoke only socially, a few cigarettes a month. He had also lost all of his excess weight, so he felt much more confident that his application would be approved. When Ernie had applied for insurance with ABC Insurance Co., they reported his heart problems to the Medical Information Bureau (MIB). When the underwriter at XYZ Insurance Co. started working on his application, he searched the MIB database for any previous applications by Ernie. The MIB alerted him to the fact that another insurance company had reported that Ernie had heart problems and was a heavy smoker. While XYZ Insurance Co.\u2019s underwriter could not use this as a basis for denying Ernie\u2019s application, it did prompt him to request a copy of Ernie\u2019s past medical records and he also required Ernie to undergo a full medical exam, including various heart-related tests. Based on those results, the underwriter declined his application. 9.4.5 Motor vehicle record (MVR) \u00b6 A motor vehicle record (MVR) provides details of the life insured\u2019s driving history; poor driving habits are directly correlated to a higher risk of death. The underwriter will have an interest in violations, accidents, drunk driving charges, licence suspensions, and points. Statistics have shown that a person\u2019s driving record directly influences their risk of death. As a result, infractions such as failing to use a seatbelt or speeding may often cause a life insurance policy to be rated, resulting in much higher premiums. 9.4.6 Inspection report \u00b6 An inspection report is completed by an independent contractor by a telephone interview (more commonly) or personal visit (less commonly). It focuses on non-medical issues that need more details or investigation, such as personal finances or dangerous hobbies. An inspection report usually focuses on non-medical issues and could include questions about the life insured\u2019s: Habits\u2014e.g., smoking/tobacco use, alcohol consumption; Finances\u2014e.g., income or estimated net worth; Occupation\u2014e.g., confirmation of employment, nature of duties; Driving record\u2014e.g., history of speeding tickets, careless driving; Avocation\u2014e.g., participation in extreme sports or hazardous travel. 9.4.7 Requests for clarification or more information \u00b6 Unclear or incomplete information will require the underwriter to ask for more information. This slows down underwriting. 9.4.8 Financial underwriting \u00b6 Just as medical underwriting establishes evidence of good health, financial underwriting establishes financial health - that is, the ability to pay premiums and the need for coverage. Life insurance companies provide a maximum amount of coverage based on how the coverage would be used if the life insured died: If used for income replacement, coverage may be set at a multiple of earned income (this multiple typically declines with age); If used for estate planning, coverage may be tied to net worth. If the policy is for a university student, coverage may be tied to the intended occupation. 9.4.9 People who are not Canadian citizens \u00b6 Different underwriting criteria may apply to those who are not Canadian citizens. 9.4.9.1 Permanent residents \u00b6 A permanent resident has been granted permission to live and work in Canada without any time limit on their stay. Permanent residents are generally treated for underwriting like Canadian citizens except they may have to provide a copy of their Permanent Resident Card. A permanent resident who has been in Canada for less than one year may have to provide extra medical proof of insurability. A permanent resident who frequently visits their home country may face a rating for premiums or exclusion of coverage when at home. 9.4.9.2 Awaiting permanent residency \u00b6 Those who have not been granted permanent residency may not be eligible for coverage. If coverage is available, its maximum may be linked to occupation. For example, a doctor could qualify for up to $5 million in coverage while a nanny could qualify for up to $250,000. A dependent spouse or children of the life insured may qualify for a percentage of the coverage on the life insured (for example, 50% of the coverage of the life insured). Additional underwriting information may be required linked to medical and/or financial factors. 9.4.9.3 International students \u00b6 International students are those from other countries who study in Canada. They do not usually qualify for coverage. 9.4.10 Frequent travellers \u00b6 Those who travel frequently may be deemed a higher risk depending on the frequency of travel, where they go, and how long they go. Travel to certain countries may be excluded from coverage. For example, a person who frequently travels to Afghanistan may find that their death benefit will not be paid if they die in Afghanistan. 9.4.11 Avocations \u00b6 An avocation is a hobby or activity voluntarily undertaken outside work for personal enjoyment. Common high-risk avocations include: Parasailing; Scuba diving; Backcountry snowboarding and skiing. Participation in high-risk avocations will require an underwriter to assess how frequently the life insured participates, the location and timing of their participation, expertise in the avocation, and past accidents or certification violations. 9.5 Risk classes and their impact on premiums \u00b6 Recall that when evaluating the risk of the life insured, the underwriter starts with a baseline (e.g., 100) and then adds to or subtracts from this amount after evaluating each risk factor, based on how the life insured compares to the standard person of the same age. When this evaluation is complete, the underwriter can assign the life insured to a risk class. Each insurance company will have their own class system and a number of classes, but general categories are discussed below. 9.5.1 Standard \u00b6 Every insurance company will have a standard or normal risk category, which represents the average person. The life insured in this risk class is offered a standard premium. 9.5.2 Preferred \u00b6 Insurance companies usually have one or more preferred categories, for people who present an exceptionally low risk. The life insured in this risk class is offered a lower-than-standard \u201cpreferred rate\u201d premium. 9.5.3 Rated \u00b6 Rated risk is above-average risk but still insurable. The life insured in this risk class is offered a higher-than-standard premium. 9.5.4 Exclusions \u00b6 Excluded risk is one particular factor that must be excluded from coverage. The life insured in this risk class is offered a premium for their risk class (that is, standard, preferred or rated) with an exclusion for death arising from the identified factor or event. For example, Nick is a standard risk except he frequently scuba dives. Nick\u2019s policy specifies that the death benefit will not be paid if he dies scuba diving or as a result of scuba diving. Example Michael immigrated to Canada from Lebanon 35 years ago, and he is a Canadian citizen. He recently applied for life insurance, and the underwriter noted that Michael was in exceptionally good health and would normally be eligible for preferred rates. However, he also noted that Michael returns to Lebanon every other year to visit his parents and siblings, who still live in that country, which often experiences periods of armed conflict. Rather than declining Michael\u2019s application, the insurance company issued a policy at preferred rates with an exclusion for travel to Lebanon. This means that if Michael dies while in Lebanon, the death benefit will not be paid. 9.5.5 Upgrading risk class \u00b6 Once a policy is issued, the risk class cannot be changed to a higher rating - for example, a preferred cannot become a standard. However, it is possible to improve the life insured\u2019s risk class if the reason for the rating no longer exists. For example, Josh switches jobs - from being a fireman to being a computer programmer. He could request his policy risk be reassessed. If the risk factor of his new job is lower, his premium may go down. The reason that a life insurance company would consider a request for a reassessment of premium costs is competition within the industry. If the rating is not removed, the policyholder may be tempted to cancel the policy and apply for a new policy, with a lower or no rating, at a competing company. Example When Bill first applied for life insurance, he was a commercial fisherman, which is one of the most dangerous occupations in terms of risk of death. While he was able to obtain insurance, the policy was rated and came with a hefty premium. Once his daughter was born, Bill left the fishing industry and he now works as a janitor for the local school board. Bill should ask his insurance company if the hazardous occupation rating can be removed from his policy, with a corresponding reduction in premiums. 9.5.6 Declined \u00b6 When a risk is too great, the application is declined: A permanent decline will never be reconsidered; A temporary decline will be defined as a period of time that must pass before an application is made again. 9.6 Client factors that may affect premiums \u00b6 One of the components that affects life insurance premiums is the net cost of pure insurance (NCPI), which in turn is based upon the risk that the life insured will die during the period of coverage. This risk is evaluated during the underwriting process that was just discussed. There are many risk factors that are common to all people. This section examines those risk factors and their impact on the policy\u2019s premiums. 9.6.1 Age \u00b6 The net cost of pure insurance is one of the factors used in determining the cost of insurance premiums. This cost is based on the risk that the life insured dies during the period of coverage. Risk of death increases with age. Therefore, premiums increase with age. Note that this relationship is not linear - the risk of death increases at a greater rate as a person ages, particularly after the ages of 60 or 65. Diagram 9.1 Impact of age at issue on premiums\u00b9 \u00b9 Based on rates provided by Canada Life for the first 10-year term of a $250,000 10-year renewable term life insurance policy for a male with a standard health profile. 9.6.1.1 Attained age \u00b6 This concept was introduced in Chapter 2 (Section 2.6.2). Remember from Chapter 2 that depending on the insurance company, the attained age of the life insured may be the age of the life insured on their last, nearest or next birthday. 9.6.2 Gender \u00b6 Women generally live longer than men. Therefore, men have a higher risk of death. Premiums for male life insureds are generally higher (all other factors being equal) than for females. Diagram 9.2 Impact of gender on premiums\u00b2 \u00b2 Based on rates provided by Canada Life for a $250,000 10-year renewable term life insurance policy for a male and female with a standard health profile. 9.6.3 Health status or risk class \u00b6 In Section 9.5 above it states that higher risk equals higher premiums. Each life insurance company will have its own system for classifying risk. Most companies will have between three and five risk categories. Diagram 9.3 Impact of health class on premiums\u00b3 \u00b3 Based on rates provided by Canada Life for a $250,000 10-year renewable term life insurance policy for a male in various health classes Example John applied for a $15 million life insurance coverage with Insure4life Co. Insure4life\u2019s retention limit is $10 million, but they were still interested in placing the policy. They contacted Resure Co., a reinsurance company, to underwrite the additional $5 million of coverage, and Resure agreed. Insure4life issued a $15 million policy to John, and he pays the full premium directly to them. Insure4life, in turn, pays a premium to Resure. If John dies, Insure4life will pay the full-death benefit of $15 million, but then it will receive a death benefit of $5 million from Resure. 9.6.4 Hazardous occupation \u00b6 More dangerous jobs have a higher risk of death and correspondingly higher premium than jobs with a lower degree of physical risk. 9.6.5 Hazardous lifestyle \u00b6 Whenever and, however, risk is introduced, it is accommodated by charging a higher premium unless the risk is so extreme that it leads to the policy being declined. 9.7 Company factors that may affect premiums \u00b6 Recall that, once a policy is issued and the premium is set, premiums cannot be increased. Therefore, if a life insurance company experiences higher costs than anticipated - or lower revenues - it can only charge higher premiums on new policies it issues. 9.7.1 Mortality costs \u00b6 If life insurance company underwriters do a poor job of risk assessment, the company may pay more in death benefits than anticipated, or pay sooner than anticipated. The amounts actually paid out in benefits are the mortality costs for the company. This can drive up premium prices for the company; the insurer may lose its competitive edge in premium pricing. If an insurance company has higher mortality costs than it expected, it may raise premiums on new policies to compensate. 9.7.2 Administration costs and expenses \u00b6 An insurance company is a business that, like all businesses, has expenses. These include expenses such as marketing, underwriting, issuing and administering policy documents, and investigating and processing claims. An insurance company must earn enough to pay its costs through its investment of premiums and premium charges. A company with higher costs will charge higher premiums. 9.7.3 Investment returns \u00b6 As described above, investment returns are key for the payment of expenses. Low investment returns, whether current or expected, can mean higher premiums. 9.8 Reinsurance \u00b6 As noted previously, maximum limits apply to the amount of coverage available in a life insurance policy. Such maximums are called the insurance company retention limit. A company insures individuals to its retention limit. If coverage is more than that limit, a reinsurance company assumes the balance of the coverage. For example, A+ Insurance has a retention limit of $25 million. If a policyholder wants $30 million in coverage, Z+ Reinsurance provides the extra $5 million in coverage. The policyholder pays the premium to the insurance company and the insurance company pays a premium to the reinsurer. On death, the insurance company pays the full death benefit and the reinsurer pays its share to the insurance company. As per the preceding example, the life insured with $30 million in coverage dies. A+ Insurance pays the beneficiary $30 million and Z+ Reinsurance pays $5 million to A+. 9.9 Issuing the policy \u00b6 The underwriting process does not stop with the issuing of the policy; it continues right up until delivery and acceptance of the policy. 9.9.1 Delivery \u00b6 Delivery is another step in the underwriting of the policy. Delivery should be made by the agent, in person, to assess any last-minute changes in the risk posed by the life insured. Changes could be: Financial, due to a change in occupation or other financial issue; Medical, due to a change in health; Lifestyle, due to a new interest or activity or discontinuation of an avocation declared on the application. The agent should review with the policyholder the policy: Grace period: the 30 days following premium due date in which the premium can be paid before the policy lapses; Incontestability clause; the two years following policy issue in which the policy can be voided by the insurance company if material misrepresentation occurred; Suicide exclusion period: the two years following policy issue in which the death benefit will not be paid if death is by suicide. The policy should only be delivered after satisfying these conditions, receiving confirmation in writing that there has been no material change in the circumstances of the applicant, and receiving any outstanding premiums. If the agent suspects or confirms a change, all policy documents should be returned to the insurance company for further consideration and potentially new underwriting. 9.10 Acceptance \u00b6 The policyholder must accept the policy by signing and dating an acknowledgement provided by the insurance company. After acceptance, client\u2019s review period begins. During this period, the client may exercise their right of rescission. Rescission is the legal right to be freed from a contract. For insurance, the policyholder must receive a minimum of 10 days to exercise this right - therefore, the client has a 10-day right of rescission period. During this period, the client should review the policy and its details. Note that the right of rescission for the insurance company is two years, not 10 days as for the client. For the insurance company, this is known as their two-year contestability period. 9.11 Group life insurance \u00b6 Underwriting of a group policy is done on the group as a whole. The underwriter examines the characteristics of the group (such as the mix of age, gender and occupation in the group), and compares one group against the company\u2019s experience with similar groups to assess risk and determine premiums. 9.11.1 Basic group life insurance \u00b6 If there are no membership classes (such as different benefits for different classes of employee), one cost (per $1,000 of coverage) applies to every group member as the premium. When membership classes exist, each class has its own premium rate. Premiums are usually recalculated annually. 9.11.2 Additional coverage \u00b6 As discussed in group insurance, additional life insurance coverage may be offered to group members, for example as units of term insurance. Individuals who apply for additional coverage are usually required to provide proof of insurability and underwritten on an individual basis. 9.11.3 Creditor life insurance \u00b6 Creditor life insurance is a type of group insurance. Underwriting for creditor life insurance is superficial\u2014based on a questionnaire requiring yes/no responses. A \u201cYes\u201d response to a question that requires a \u201cNo\u201d answer (or vice-versa) could lead to more in-depth assessment. When creditor insurance is offered through a financial institution (not an insurance company), the applicant must complete the application without assistance from any employees of the financial institution as those employees are not insurance agents. Coverage is usually limited to established maximums unless medical underwriting is performed. Premiums are set at a fixed monthly rate based on the loan outstanding and the age group of the life insured. 9.11.3.1 Post-claim underwriting \u00b6 Post-claim underwriting occurs after a life insured has died. It assesses whether the life insured qualified for coverage. The underwriting may determine that a death benefit should not be paid. There is no recourse for survivors if it is not paid.","title":"Chapter 9 Application and Underwriting"},{"location":"life/Chapter_9_Application_and_Underwriting/#chapter-9-application-and-underwriting","text":"","title":"Chapter 9: Application and Underwriting"},{"location":"life/Chapter_9_Application_and_Underwriting/#91-process-overview","text":"Underwriting is the process an insurance company uses to assess the risk presented by the life insurance applicant.

Therefore, they have an insurable interest in their own life; The lives of a policyholder\u2019s spouse, child or grandchild, employee, person who financially supported by the policyholder, or anyone else in whom the policyholder has a financial (or \u201cpecuniary\u201d) interest; Anyone who consents in writing to the insurance on their life. Note that the insurable interest must only be present at the time the policy is issued. If the relationship between the policyholder and the life insured changes such that the insurable interest no longer exists, the contract is still valid. Example 1 When Isabelle and her husband Justin had their first child, Justin bought a $500,000 20-year term life insurance policy on Isabelle\u2019s life. Isabelle and Justin divorced a few years later and Isabelle has since remarried. Justin no longer has an insurable interest in Isabelle\u2019s life; the existing policy remains valid, but Justin would likely not be able to buy any additional coverage on Isabelle\u2019s life. Example 2 Justin\u2019s next door neighbour, Caleb, is an adventurous person who has a passion for extreme sports and travel. When Justin heard that Caleb was planning to go on a solo snowmobile expedition to the North Pole, Justin joked that he should buy life insurance on Caleb\u2019s life.

If John dies, Insure4life will pay the full-death benefit of $15 million, but then it will receive a death benefit of $5 million from Resure.","title":"9.6.3 Health status or risk class"},{"location":"life/Chapter_9_Application_and_Underwriting/#964-hazardous-occupation","text":"More dangerous jobs have a higher risk of death and correspondingly higher premium than jobs with a lower degree of physical risk.","title":"9.6.4 Hazardous occupation"},{"location":"life/Chapter_9_Application_and_Underwriting/#965-hazardous-lifestyle","text":"Whenever and, however, risk is introduced, it is accommodated by charging a higher premium unless the risk is so extreme that it leads to the policy being declined.","title":"9.6.5 Hazardous lifestyle"},{"location":"life/Chapter_9_Application_and_Underwriting/#97-company-factors-that-may-affect-premiums","text":"Recall that, once a policy is issued and the premium is set, premiums cannot be increased.

Investing can only begin when a individual has savings; savings can be encouraged by: Making savings an item in the budget by using effecctive ways like pre-authorized contribution (PAC) or pre-authorized deposit (PAD) to a savings or investment account; Save at 10% of take-home pay; Save exceptional payments - e.g: income-tax refunds and work bonus; Set up savings buckets that can include retirement, holidays, or big-ticket items. Investments may be: Guaranteed, in which some or all of the principal is guaranteed to be repaid to the investor; For some kinds of investments, some growth may also be guaranteed; Non-guaranteed, in which neither principal nor profit is guaranteed to be repaid; Examples of guaranteed investments include Guaranteed Investment Certificates, and some bonds; Examples of non-guaranteed investments include stocks, mutual funds, and real estate. Example Jean is 78 years old and relies on the returns from her investments to generate income to support her in retirement. Her investments, combined with her pensions, allow her to live comfortably. Jean feels that she cannot afford to risk her invested money in an investment that would not pay both her principal plus the stated return. Therefore, Jean chooses guaranteed investments to ensure that she will not experience losses. 1.1.2 Investment basics \u00b6 Some investment fundamentals are essential to understand how investing works, how returns are generated for investors, and how investors manage risk. 1.1.2.1 Compounding (compound interest) \u00b6 Compounding refers to earning interest on an investment. When the interest is paid, it is reinvested in the investment. The next interest payment is based on the principal and interest already received. As a result, the investor earns interest on interest. This form of interest is called compound interest. Withdrawals reduce the effect of compounding. To maximize compounding, all investment returns must be reinvested. As Table 1.1 shows, compound interest achieves escalated investment growth. Table 1.1 Investment growth escalated by compound interest Since compounding works better over a longer time period, younger investors have an advantage. This is why advisors recommend that individuals start saving as early in life as possible. Compounding can also work negatively. For example, costs, such as debt with unpaid balances where interest is charged, can also compound. 1.1.2.2 Investment returns \u00b6 All investments have one of three types of return: Investment returns can be positive and generate profits; Returns can be neutral where an investor receives the original principal, but no profit; Returns can be negative where the investor loses money on the investment\u2014this is a risk of investing. The \u201crate of return\u201d is expressed as a percentage of the principal or amount invested. This percentage can be positive or negative depending on the performance of the investment. Example Salim invests $10,000 but receives $11,000 when he sells the investment. The $1,000 profit ( $11,000 \u2013 $10,000) is a 10% rate of return ( $1,000 \u00f7 $10,000). In some cases, investors may be informed of the expected rate of return on an investment before they invest. In others, it is impossible to tell investors what to expect because the return is unknown. This is a characteristic of a risky investment. Investing involves a scale of risk which indicates the likelihood of the investor getting their principal repaid. Investment risk can range from very low risk at the bottom of the scale to higher risks toward the top, with speculative risk at the very top. The lower the risk, the greater the likelihood of receiving back all invested money. Speculative investments carry the highest level of risk. It is highly unlikely that an investor with a speculative investment will get back all of his invested money. On the plus side, speculative investments can generate higher returns (and a significant profit) than lower-risk investments. The risk/return theory is: reward those who are prepared to take greater risk with greater returns. Those who are able to take less risk are not similarly rewarded: less risk = lower returns. Returns are classified as nominal or real. A nominal return is the \u201cnamed\u201d or stated rate of return, before considering inflation. For example, a 2% return advertised for a savings account is a nominal return. A real return incorporates inflation. Its formula is: Nominal return - inflation = real return Example If the annual nominal return on a Guaranteed Investment Certificate is 3% and the annual rate of inflation is 1.8%, then the real rate of return on the bond is 1.2% (3% \u2013 1.8%). 1.1.2.3 Asset classes \u00b6 Investments can have similar characteristics and be governed by similar laws and regulations. They are assigned to asset classes based on those similarities. Asset classes fall into three main categories. Stocks (also called \u201cequities\u201d); Bonds (also called \u201cfixed income\u201d or \u201cdebt\u201d); Cash (also called \u201cmoney market instruments\u201d). Two other classes are often added to the three main asset classes\u2014real estate and commodities. Each asset class has its own risk and return profile. Diversification mixes assets from the different asset classes. 1.1.2.4 Diversification \u00b6 Diversification is a strategy to manage risk. It spreads invested funds over the different asset classes. When asset classes and investments within those classes are combined, investing risk can be lowered, and the expected overall returns may be higher, than if all savings were put into one investment. Economic conditions can vary by country. Diversification can be used to take advantage of favourable economic conditions with investments in other countries. Segregated funds are a good fit for a diversified investment approach. Segregated funds can be invested by their managers in a range of investments depending on the fund. For example, a segregated bond fund will invest in many different bonds that mature at different times, carry different risks, and pay out at different interest rates. Mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) share similar diversification characteristics as segregated funds. Since most investors lack the capital to self-diversify their holdings, investing in a fund-type investment helps them to achieve and benefit from adequate diversification. 1.1.2.5 Liquidity \u00b6 Investments can be termed as either \u201cliquid\u201d or \u201cilliquid.\u201d Liquidity describes the ability to cash in, or sell, an investment quickly at or near its current market price A liquid investment has the characteristics of liquidity. For example, a savings account is a liquid investment because some or all of its value can be quickly accessed for use. An investment that does not have characteristics of liquidity is called \u201cilliquid.\u201d Real estate is often cited as an example of an illiquid investment, where the sale of a property may take some time to complete and can result in a price below market value. Liquidity is essential in an emergency fund, in which a portion of earnings are set aside for emergency use, for example, to replace a sudden loss of income. The need will be for a timely sale at highest market value. 1.1.3 Time value of money \u00b6 The principle of time value of money is described in two ways: The present value of money (PV); and The future value of money (FV). Invested money has the potential to increase in value over time due to interest earned (or other returns). The difference in value between the same sums of money received at different times form the basis for the present and future value principles. 1.1.3.1 Present value \u00b6 Present value (PV) is an important calculation in many financial planning activities. PV works backwards from a future date. It is used to determine how much needs to be saved today to yield a specific amount in the future. For example, knowing how much needs to be invested today for a retirement nest egg in 10 years\u2019 time or calculating post-secondary education expenses. Present value tells us that if $5,000 is needed at a future date, less than $5,000 needs to be saved today because today\u2019s sum will earn interest and grow over time. Example Joe\u2019s daughter Sarah will be going to college in five years. He believes the cost of the first year\u2019s tuition and living expenses will be $28,000. He has just been paid for a large contract he completed. He needs to do a PV calculation to tell him how much of that money to set aside now to have the $28,000 when it will be needed. Present value can be calculated when the following are known: The future sum; The future date when the sum is needed; A specified interest rate between today and the future date. Financial calculators, available online, or in software provided by insurers, are used to calculate PV. PV is applied to both a sum of money and cash flows received over time. The formula for PV is: PV = FV \u00f7 (1 + interest rate)\u207f FV is the known future value and n is the number of time periods for the calculation (i.e., yearly, semi-annually, etc.) Example Julie wants to know how much is needed today to provide $5,000 in five years, given the current interest rate of 3%. The present value of $5,000 in five years based on 3% interest is: $4,313.04 (PV = $5,000 \u00f7 (1 + 0.03)\u2075). Julie needs to invest $4,313.04 at 3% interest today to equal $5,000 in five years\u2019 time. The following chart shows which calculation is needed to replace the question marks with dollar figures: 1.1.3.2 Future value \u00b6 The future value (FV) calculation provides the value of a current investment at a future date, given the interest earned on the investment (i.e., how much should be put in savings or investments to be worth in x years\u2019 time?). Therefore, if a future retiree has a certain amount saved for retirement purposes, he can determine how much that amount will be worth at retirement with a future value calculation. Example Ted wants to know how much is needed today (PV) to provide $6,000 (FV) in 5 years (n, where interest rate is annual). The interest rate is 5% in the example. The PV of $6,000 in 5 years (n), based on 5% interest is: $4701.16 PV= $6,000 \u00f7 (1+ 0.05)\u2075 In the example $4,701.16 (PV) must be invested to provide $6,000 (FV) in five years\u2019 time (n) at an interest rate of 5%. The future value can be calculated when the following are known: The amount of today\u2019s investment (the present value); The future date; The specified interest rate between today and the future date. Financial calculators can be used to determine the future value. The information can also be obtained from online calculators and sales resources provided by the insurers. The FV formula is: FV = PV \u00d7 (1 + interest rate)\u207f PV is the known present value and n the number of periods for the calculation (yearly, semi-annually, etc.). Example Sam has $5,000 today and wants to know the value of that sum in 5 years, given the current interest rate of 3%. The future value of $5,000 in 5 years\u2019 time at 3% annual interest is: $5,796.37 (FV = $5,000 \u00d7 (1 + 0.03)\u2075). Sam will have $5,796.37 available for his needs in 5 years if he invests $5,000 today at 3% interest. 1.2 Investment Objectives \u00b6 Investment objectives are the reasons and end goals for investing and saving. These objectives (what the funds are needed for), and their time constraints (when the money is needed) will form the basis for investment decisions. Investment objectives fall into three categories: Short term: 3 years or less for the goal to be reached; Medium term: 3 years to 10 years; Long term: 10 years or more. Saving for a holiday next year is a short-term objective whereas saving for a new car or the down payment on a home in five years are medium-term objectives. Saving for retirement is a common long-term objective. It is accommodated in savings plans for individuals and in group savings plans offered to employees who are members of group plans. Example Small Company is a technology company that needs to attract very specific computer programmers and mathematicians. These types of employees are in high demand in Small Company\u2019s city. To make Small Company attractive to potential employees it provides a very generous retirement savings plan. Knowing the client is the key to determining their investment objectives. In the case of a group plan, the client is the plan administrator, who is usually an employer. 1.2.1 Account purpose \u00b6 Both registered and non-registered accounts are available for the purpose of saving and investing. Registered accounts are individually registered in the owner\u2019s name with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). Non-registered accounts are also available for savings and investing, and have flexibility for deposits and withdrawals (unlike registered accounts). Registered accounts have specific features that align the account with its purpose. For example, a Registered Education Savings Plan offers government grants that help savings grow to usually help a child with post-secondary school costs. Accounts serve different purposes: For retirement: Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), Registered Pension Plan (for group members), and the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA); For education savings: Registered Education Savings Plan and the Tax-free Savings Account (TFSA); For the disabled: Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) and the Tax-free Savings Account (TFSA). Note, the Tax-free Savings Account (TFSA) is a general savings account available for any purpose. These accounts hold the investment choices of the account owner. For example, an RRSP could hold Guaranteed Investment Certificates, and segregated funds. This means that investors can be dissatisfied with the investment choices in an account, but cannot be dissatisfied with the account type. If an investor is unsatisfied with the investments in their registered account, those investments can be removed and replaced with more suitable choices. 1.2.2 Financial goals \u00b6 A financial goal is created when an investment objective (such as retirement) is assigned a dollar figure (such as $500,000). Its purpose is to set a benchmark for saving and investing. 1.2.3 Need for guaranteed investments \u00b6 Guaranteed investments are the gold standard for those who are not risk takers. Why? The guarantee provides that some or all of the principal will be paid back to the investor when the investment term ends; Some profit may also be guaranteed to be paid to the investor; Investors will know any factors of timing that may apply to their investment, that is they will know in advance when their invested money will be made available for their use; Investors whose income has become limited\u2014for example, due to retirement\u2014have the security of knowing their money will be repaid to them at a time when they are no longer able to regenerate that sum through employment. 1.2.4 Time horizon \u00b6 A time horizon is the time at which invested savings are needed according to the investment objective: Each objective has its own time horizon; The time horizon is usually an event, such as retirement; big purchases like a new home or property; paying for a new car or post-secondary education; or starting a new business. The future value of money calculation can inform an investor what the value of their investment will be at the time horizon. Example Martin has just received an inheritance of $200,000. His time horizon to retirement is seven years. If he can assume he will earn 4% per year, in 7 years\u2019 time, his inheritance will be worth: $263,186 (FV = $200,000 \u00d7 (1 + 0.04)\u2077). 1.2.5 Tax-advantaged investing \u00b6 Returns from investments are received in the form of: Interest : Paid by the least risky investments; Taxed at the highest rate (the same as income earned from working); Foreign income including foreign dividends is taxed in the same manner as interest income. Dividends : Paid by companies from their earnings to their stock owners. Not all companies pay dividends, and there is no guarantee that a dividend will be paid; Taxed at a rate lower than interest if they are paid as a result of owning stock in a qualifying Canadian company, because those kinds of dividends benefit from a dividend tax credit. Capital gains : Paid by or earned in the riskiest investments; Taxed at a lower rate than interest, because only half of the gain is taxable; When the investment loses value, the investor receives a capital loss. One half of the capital loss can be deducted from taxable capital gains on other investments. The loss must be used first against capital gains in the year the loss is incurred. However, if capital gains are unavailable or insufficient in that year, the capital loss may be applied against capital gains in any of the three previous years, or in any future year. Therefore, this reduces the amount of taxable capital gain and the tax to be paid on that gain. 1.3 Types of Investments \u00b6 A life agent can sell segregated funds and annuity investments. An agent needs knowledge of the many other types of investments to compare the features, risks and benefits of each investment that best suits the needs of his clients. An agent also attains a better understanding of segregated funds through gaining a better understanding of the other types of investments available. The following information is categorized for each type of investment in this section: Advantages and disadvantages; Where and how to buy; Sub-categories of the investment (if any); Returns and guarantees; Risks of investing; Investor protection. 1.3.1 Segregated funds \u00b6 Segregated funds, also called Individual Variable Insurance Contracts (IVICs) and \u201cseg\u201d funds, are created and sold by life insurance companies and approved by regulators. The inception date of a fund is the date on which it can first be offered to investors. The assets in segregated funds are kept separate, or segregated, from other assets of the insurer. Insurers are required, by law, to set aside financial reserves so they can meet their contractual obligations for maturity and death benefit guarantees. Many types of segregated funds are available, to suit different investment objectives. With a segregated fund, investors deposit their savings to the fund (or funds) of their choice. The deposits create a pool of money, which is used by the segregated fund manager to acquire investments according to the type of fund they manage. For example, deposits to a bond fund are used by the segregated fund manager to buy a wide range of bonds. Segregated funds can be held in registered and non-registered accounts. Segregated fund investors may face a sales fee when they invest. This charge is paid once. It may be charged up front as a front-end load (FEL) as a percentage of the sum invested or the sales fee may decline over years (called a deferred sales charge) until it is eliminated. It is charged as the percentage of the amount withdrawn if a partial or total withdrawal is made from the fund: Investors also pay an annual fee called the management expense; More information is provided on fees later in this Module. 1.3.1.1 Advantages and disadvantages of segregated funds \u00b6 As a fund-type investment, segregated funds share some characteristics with other fund investments, such as mutual funds. Segregated funds provide some unique features and benefits due to the fact that they are an insurance product and delivered through an insurance contract. These include: Possible creditor protection to their policy owner; Beneficiaries are named; Probate is bypassed. Guarantees provide a benefit on death and at contract maturity; Reset options; Tax benefit when capital losses are incurred; Assuris protection against insolvency of the insurer. Some of the advantages segregated funds share with other fund investments are: There are a variety of funds; Ease of investment; Information readily available on funds before and after purchase; Diversification provided; Managed professionally; Provides liquidity; Ease of switching between funds; Ease of redemption; Ability to create an income stream from account value. Segregated fund disadvantages include: A minimum ten-year term-to-maturity for the investment contract; Higher annual fees than other fund investments; Possible age restrictions to entering a contract and deposits. Some disadvantages segregated funds share with other fund investments are: Too many choices of funds and often little differentiation between choices; Sales charges and ongoing fees charged as the MER. 1.3.1.2 Where and how to buy segregated funds \u00b6 Only those who are life-licensed can sell segregated funds. Some segregated funds are sold by investment dealers but in that case, the dealers are acting as agents for the life insurers only. A segregated fund investor: Acquires information about a segregated fund from his agent and an Information Folder provided by the insurer offering the fund; Completes the application, usually with the assistance of the agent; Receives the contract, provides a deposit, and signs the contract. The contract is issued with a 10-year term-to-maturity. The contract is an insurance policy, and the investor is the policy owner. 1.3.1.3 Types of segregated funds \u00b6 Many types of segregated funds are offered. To create segregated funds, fund managers may concentrate their investments in: Asset classes (described previously) alone or in combination. When assets are combined in one fund, a balanced fund is created. Countries or geographical areas; Other segregated funds: These are called funds of funds. All fund types are not created equal\u2014for example, each fund that exclusively invests in stocks will hold shares of different companies. When funds hold the shares of the same companies, the amount of shares held by each fund will differ. The reason so many types of funds are available is to provide a choice among levels of risk and rates of return. 1.3.1.4 Returns and guarantees of segregated funds \u00b6 The word \u201creturn\u201d has two separate meanings: Return describes performance. When \u201creturn\u201d is used in this way, it is stated as a percentage. That percentage is a measure of how the value has changed (up or down) since the return was last reported; The percentage is arrived at by comparing growth against last-reported value; The returns for segregated funds are posted monthly, every three months, year-to-date, one year, two years, five years, 10 years, and since inception. Example Phil receives a statement about his segregated fund that shows his contract has a value of $10,000. The next statement shows his contract has a value of $11,000. Therefore, his return for the period has been 10% (1,000 \u00f7 10,000). Return describes the form in which growth is earned: Note, these are described previously as interest, dividends, and capital gains; Segregated funds can earn interest, dividends, and capital gains, which are reinvested in the fund as they are earned; Registered account owners (that is, RRSP accounts) do not report returns on their annual income tax. When the time comes to make a withdrawal from their registered account, the sum investors receive is taxed at the same as income from interest, regardless of how it was actually earned (such as capital gains). This is true for taxable registered accounts (a tax-free savings account is an exception because it is not a taxable account); Non-registered account owners receive the returns in the form they are earned, for example as a capital gain, and report them in that form for income tax each year. There are two guarantees provided by segregated funds: Maturity guarantee: This guarantees the investor will receive a minimum of 75% of his investment when the contract matures; If the market value is higher than 75%, the investor receives the market value. Death benefit guarantee: This guarantees the beneficiary of the contract will receive a minimum of 75% of the sum invested in the contract if the life insured dies while the contract is in force. If the market value is higher than 75%, the beneficiary receives the market value. Example 1 June invests $10,000 in her segregated fund contract with a 75% maturity guarantee. When the contract matures, she will receive $7,500 ( $10,000 x 75%); or the market value if it is higher than $7,500. Example 2 Dane invests $10,000 in his segregated fund contract with a 75% death benefit guarantee. When he dies in year seven of the contract, it is worth $6,250. His beneficiary receives $7,500. Together these guarantees limit losses. The investor knows that the maximum amount of loss they can experience is the difference between the sum invested and the guarantee amount. 1.3.1.5 Risks of investing in segregated funds \u00b6 While the death benefit guarantee applies throughout the contract, the maturity guarantee applies only at maturity. Therefore, if the policy owner needed to terminate his policy before maturity, they would receive its market value only. This could be less or more than the sum invested. The maturity guarantee may leave a non-guaranteed 25% gap between sum invested and sum guaranteed. This has the potential to deliver a 25% loss on the investment. The investor must commit to the full 10-year contract to receive the maturity guarantee. 1.3.1.6 Investor protection \u00b6 Assuris is an organization that provides policyholder protection up to certain limits, against the insolvency or bankruptcy of the insurer that holds investor deposits in its segregated funds. Assuris does not provide protection against market losses. Protection against a loss in the value of an investment is provided by the guarantees of certain investments, like the 75% segregated fund maturity guarantee. Non-guaranteed investments can fall to zero value in the market and there is no recourse for the investor. 1.3.2 Annuities \u00b6 An annuity is structured to repay a regular income over time. They are highly secure, widely available, and protected by Assuris. An annuity contract is set up between the insurer and the investor. The investor names the annuitant, the person who receives the income payments. Annuity payments are a combination the investor\u2019s principal and interest paid by the insurer. The annuitant may also be known as the \u201cannuitant grantee\u201d or \u201cpayee.\u201d The wording of different parties to a contract may differ from contract to contract. For this reason, it is very important to understand the definitions of an annuity contract. The amount received by the annuitant is called an \u201cannuity payment.\u201d An annuity payment is usually set or \u201cfixed\u201d for its term; changing interest rates have no effect. Several types of annuity do not have fixed annuity rates. Their payments are variable. Each guarantees a minimum payment. One form of variable annuity links to investment performance. Its payment will be the minimum payment plus any additional payment as a result of its investment performance. The other form of variable annuity, called an indexed annuity, links to the rate of inflation and increases payments in step with rising inflation. Therefore, its payment is a minimum payment adjusted for any increase in the inflation rate. The contract is assigned an annuity rate, which determines how much income will be paid to the annuitant: Many factors contribute to the annuity rate. The primary factor is the interest rate in effect at the time that the annuity is purchased. Other factors that may affect the annuity payments include the age and gender of the annuitant, and the amount of money deposited to the annuity contract. Annuity rates vary between providers. Annuities can be either: Fixed\u2014payments are guaranteed and will be received for the duration of the annuity; or Not Fixed\u2014payments are guaranteed at a minimum rate\u2014they are \u201cvariable\u201d and tied to the stock market, or \u201cindexed\u201d and tied to the rate of inflation. There are two main types of annuities: Payout annuities: All annuities that pay an income are classified as payout annuities. This is what most people are referring to when an annuity is mentioned. Accumulation annuities: In which savings accumulate over the term of the annuity to produce investment growth. On maturity, the investor has the choice of converting the accumulation annuity to a payout annuity. Note: this module centres on payout annuities except for a brief description of accumulation annuities in Chapter 3. 1.3.2.1 Advantages and disadvantages of annuities \u00b6 The primary advantage of annuities is their guaranteed income stream, paid for the duration of the annuity contract (typically the lifetime of the annuitant): Investment management is taken from the hands of the investor. This simplifies annuity investment and makes annuities a good choice for investors who do not have investing expertise; Annuities that are prescribed may offer some tax advantages, meaning less tax is payable in the early years of the contract; Investor protection is available for insurance annuity contracts through Assuris. The primary disadvantages of annuities are their lack of flexibility and interest rate risk: When annuity payments begin, no changes can be made to the contract. The investor will face penalties to make a withdrawal; The interest rate is set in the contract. If interest rates rise\u2014the annuity payment would increase if the annuity was purchased when higher rates were in effect\u2014they will not be applied to an existing contract. The higher rate would only apply to contracts issued while that rate is in effect. 1.3.2.2 Where and how to buy annuities \u00b6 Life insurers sell all forms of annuities. Other financial institutions, such as banks, are restricted to sales of term annuities only. An annuity contract can be held in a registered or non-registered account. 1.3.2.3 Types of annuities \u00b6 Annuities are available as either a \u201cpayout\u201d annuity that pays an income or as an \u201caccumulation\u201d annuity which is used for savings. Payout annuities are the most common. Payout annuities are available in three forms: A term annuity (also called a term certain annuity): payments are made over a specified period of time (the term); A life annuity: payments are made for the lifetime of the annuitant; A joint annuity (also called a joint and last survivor annuity): two lives are covered. Payment is made to one annuitant and on the death of that annuitant; payment is then made for the lifetime of the other annuitant. Note that insurance companies adopt these generic names for marketing purposes. 1.3.2.4 Return and guarantees of annuities \u00b6 The annuity payment is guaranteed for the duration of the annuity unless the contract is a variable or indexed annuity. As discussed, these forms of annuity provide a minimum guarantee but may supplement that amount with an additional return. 1.3.2.5 Risks of investing in annuities \u00b6 As noted above, the interest rate is set in the contract and there is no opportunity to change if interest rates go up. Another risk is introduced because the set interest rate also sets income. For an annuitant who does not have an indexed annuity inflation risk may be experienced, in which costs of living increase over time but income stays the same. Inflation risk creates a loss of purchasing power for those on a set\u2014or fixed\u2014income. The longer the term of the annuity, the greater the impact of inflation. 1.3.2.6 Investor protection \u00b6 As noted, Assuris protects investors through its coverage for annuity owners. All annuity contracts sold by insurers will be Assuris-covered. 1.3.3 Stocks \u00b6 Stocks are also called shares or equities. They represent ownership in a corporation whether that corporation is privately owned or publicly traded. Many indicators are used to predict whether stock prices will rise or fall. They may be macroeconomic\u2014for example, based on the economic conditions of a region or country. Or they may be microeconomic\u2014for example, based on a single product developed by a company. Stock values also rise and fall according to investor sentiment. Despite all the indicators available, no one knows for certain what will happen to the price of a stock. For this reason, they are considered risky investments: Some companies issue stock dividends to their shareowners; some do not. There is no absolute guarantee that dividends will be paid; Preferred shareowners receive dividends before common shareowners. The following types of segregated funds include stocks: Equity funds; Balanced funds; Growth funds. 1.3.3.1 Advantages and disadvantages of stocks \u00b6 Why buy stocks? Stock Advantages: The primary advantage of stock ownership is participation in an increase in the value of the stock. This increase is a capital gain; There is high transparency in the stock market investing as stock prices are available in the stock market. Stocks are also quickly and easily sold, though not necessarily at the value desired by the investor. Stock Disadvantages: The primary disadvantage of stock ownership is the uncertainty of a positive outcome: it is possible to lose everything you have invested; Losses in the value of the stock are partially compensated by the capital loss received by the investor, who can use that loss to offset taxable capital gains; Not all companies pay dividends and there is no guarantee that dividends will be paid; There are commissions charged on every trade; No naming a beneficiary to a non-registered account; Possible lack of diversification that exposes the investor to risk; No ability to rescind a sale; Liquidity issues if stocks have to be sold at a time when the price is low, but the investor needs money. 1.3.3.2 Where and how to buy stocks \u00b6 Publicly traded stocks are traded on stock exchanges. To buy stocks an investor needs an account with an investment dealer that provides trading services (buying and selling on a commission basis) or a discount broker (buying and selling on a reduced-commission basis). An investor pays a commission, on buying and selling, to the advisor who is registered to sell securities. Know Your Client (KYC) requirements have to be satisfied so that the sales representative is satisfied that the investment is within the financial capacity and risk tolerance of the investor. Stocks can be held in self-directed registered accounts and in non-registered accounts. 1.3.3.3 Returns and guarantees of stocks \u00b6 Stock returns are provided in the form of: Capital gains; Dividends. There are no guarantees of positive returns. 1.3.3.4 Risks of investing in stocks \u00b6 An investor in stock can experience market risk, industry risk, and the risk of loss of principal invested. Although as an asset class stocks are high risk, not all stocks are created equal. Blue-chip stocks are the stocks of large, well-known, and well-established companies and are one of the least risky forms of stock ownership. The most risky are penny stocks which are stocks valued at less than $5 that are typically illiquid and highly speculative. They may include well-known companies as well as smaller firms that are not \"household names.\" Currency risk can diminish returns if an investment is made in foreign firms. 1.3.3.5 Investor protection \u00b6 Investors are protected against the bankruptcy of an investment dealer through the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF). There is no investor protection against losses in stock value. 1.3.4 Bonds \u00b6 Bonds are also called a debt investment, as they represent a debt between a borrower, who is the bond issuer, and a lender, who is the bond investor. Bonds are also called a fixed-income security. Many segregated funds focus on bonds or include bonds as part of their portfolio. Therefore, it is important for life agents to understand how bonds work. A bond is registered electronically when it is purchased. It consists of a face amount (the principal invested) and a coupon rate, which represents the interest paid by the bond. A bond is like an IOU of a corporation or government. The investor loans the corporation or government money and receives the bond (IOU) in return. Bonds are issued with a maturity date\u2014as long as 30 years. During this period, the corporation or government compensates the investor for the use of invested money by paying interest to the investor. The maturity date is the date when the bond comes due for repayment by the issuer to the investor. On that date, the borrower (the issuer) repays the full principal amount to the investor. An investor can sell a corporate or government bond before its maturity date to another investor. An active market exists for buying and selling bonds called the secondary bond market. Bonds can be held in self-directed registered accounts and non-registered accounts. Bonds that are issued with a high credit rating can preserve and increase capital as well as provide a predictable stream of payments in the form of coupon or interest payments. A high credit rating indicates a low chance of the issuer defaulting on payments to investors. 1.3.4.1 Advantages and disadvantages of bonds \u00b6 Why buy bonds? Bonds provide an income stream via their interest payments. They can also increase in value. The bond market is vast\u2014much larger than the stock market. This gives investors a wide range of bonds to choose from, and correspondingly, bonds are available across the risk spectrum. Investors choose among credit ratings, issuers, terms to maturity, and coupon rates (i.e., interest rates) to build a diversified portfolio aiming to get higher returns while reducing overall risk. To maintain investor confidence, repayment of the face amount and interest payments are guaranteed for government bonds issued by many countries because the issuing government has government revenue at its disposal to meet its obligations. Corporate bond issuers make a commitment to repay their investors for the same reason \u2013 they need investor confidence so they will be successful when they need to borrow more money via bonds in the future. There is a slightly greater chance that corporate bond payments will not be made since a corporation's fortunes can change quickly and a corporate issuer might not have the necessary capital at its disposal to repay investors. Corporate bonds run the spectrum of risk and investors who are prepared to take a higher risk are rewarded with higher interest payments from the bond. A disadvantage of bonds is that an investor must seek them out through a securities advisor, and little information is provided about price. This lack of transparency may mean that buyers overpay for a bond. Also, terminology used to describe prices and yields of bonds can be confusing to average investors. 1.3.4.2 Where and how to buy bonds \u00b6 Bonds can be purchased from those with the proper registration for bond sales. These advisors are either licensed by IIROC or Limited Market Dealers through the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA). Many financial advisors do not have direct access to bonds as their licenses do not permit them to offer these types of securities. 1.3.4.3 Types of bonds \u00b6 Bonds are issued by all levels of government in Canada and by Canadian corporations for investors in Canada to buy. Foreign countries and corporations also issue bonds that may be purchased in Canada: Canadian government bonds are issued by the federal, provincial, and municipal governments and are typically denominated in Canadian dollars. Federal government bonds are ranked the highest, provincial bonds lower and municipal bonds lower still. Foreign bonds are issued by foreign countries in Canada, in Canadian dollars. Eurobonds are issued by a foreign country in its currency for sale in other countries, such as a bond issued by the United States in U.S. dollars for sale in Japan. Government of Canada bond characteristics: Highest credit rating of all Canadian government bonds; Issued in the name of the Government of Canada and federal Crown corporations; Terms from one year to 30 years; Start at $5,000; Fixed interest, paid semi-annually. Provincial government bond characteristics: Next highest to Government of Canada bonds in credit rating; Issued by the provinces and provincial agencies; Guaranteed payment of principal plus interest at maturity. Municipal bond characteristics: Small percentage of Canadian bond market; Lowest credit rating of all Canadian government-issued bonds; Credit rating depends on the creditworthiness of the municipality that has issued the bond. Corporate bond characteristics: Issued by companies looking to expand their operations; Risk is based on creditworthiness of the corporation issuing the bond. Foreign bonds characteristics: Governments of other countries and multinational companies may also issue bonds; Their creditworthiness is a result of the political and economic stability of the issuer. 1.3.4.4 Returns and guarantees of bonds \u00b6 Before maturity, interest payments are made by the bond issuer, usually twice a year. Interest may be fixed, floating, or payable at maturity. On maturity, the face amount of the bond is repaid with any outstanding interest obligations. The amount paid is a result of the following factors: Maturity date: Bonds are issued as short-term (3 years or less to maturity), medium term (3 years to 10 years to maturity), or long-term (10 years or more); The longer the term, the higher the interest rate on the bond. Credit quality: Bonds are rated based on the issuer's capacity to meet its financial obligations, whether that issuer is a government or a corporation. Bonds are rated according to the likelihood of repayment of face amount and payment of principal. The highest ranking bonds are called investment-grade bonds. They have an AAA rating. On the other end of the risk spectrum are bonds called high yield (because of they pay a high rate of interest) and junk bonds (because of their low rating, typically BB or lower). The return on investment-grade bonds is much lower than bonds with a higher risk of default. Price: Bonds are issued at their face value, called par value. Interest rate changes will change the price of the bond in the bond market. Selling a bond above its face amount creates a capital gain. Selling below face value realizes a capital loss. 1.3.4.5 Risks of investing in bonds \u00b6 The risks associated with investing in bonds include interest rate risk, reinvestment, credit, liquidity and inflation risk. Currency risk can affect returns on foreign bonds. These forms of risk are discussed later in this module. 1.3.4.6 Investor protection \u00b6 A bond is a type of security. Therefore, investor protection against the bankruptcy of an investment dealer is provided in the same way as it is for a stock (another type of security)\u2014through the Canadian Investor Protection Fund. The CIFP protects accounts held by its members up to specified limits if the dealer becomes insolvent. There is no protection against loss of value. 1.3.5 Savings accounts \u00b6 A savings account is an account at a financial institution that accepts deposits and pays interest, usually at a very low rate. Some accounts are offered as \"high interest\" and these typically have requirements or restrictions in order to receive the better rate. Savings accounts are easy to open, and money can be easily deposited and withdrawn. Chequing privileges may be absent or restricted. 1.3.5.1 Advantages and disadvantages of savings accounts \u00b6 Savings accounts offer convenience and liquidity unlike any other type of investment. Savers may find the interest rate on their savings account is less than the rate of inflation. Therefore, the money accumulated in saving accounts is subject to inflation risk when the account is used as a long-term investment. The result is that purchasing power is eroded over time. Savings accounts are best used for the short term as a place to \u201cpark\u201d principal while investment decisions are being made. The interest earned in a savings account is taxed at the highest rate charged to investments. This is a disadvantage compared to investments that earn dividends or receive a capital gain/loss. 1.3.5.2 Types of savings account \u00b6 Traditional savings accounts offer a low interest rate, sometimes low fees, and no withdrawal restrictions. High-interest savings accounts offer slightly higher interest rates, but there may be a requirement for contributions or a minimum balance, and withdrawal privileges may be restricted. 1.3.5.3 Returns and guarantees of savings accounts \u00b6 Returns on savings accounts are in the form of interest. Interest is paid on the account balance. Guarantees on savings accounts are largely backed by the size and strength of the financial institution providing the account. 1.3.5.4 Risks of holding savings in a saving account \u00b6 Inflation risk is experienced and increases the longer savings are held in the account because inflation compounds year-over-year. Recall that inflation is expressed by the real rate of return on an investment. Example Ethel has $10,000 in her savings account that paid 1.5% annual interest last year. The inflation rate for the year was 2.8%. Therefore, Ethel\u2019s real rate of return was -1.3%. 1.3.5.5 Investor protection \u00b6 Provided by Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation to its members for up to $100,000 per account. 1.3.6 Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) \u00b6 A GIC is a form of deposit to a financial institution in which there is a term to maturity before principal and interest will be repaid to the investor. Interest is guarenteed except when the GIC is linked to the stock market preformance. GICs can be held in registered accounts and non-registered accounts. 1.3.6.1 Advantages and disadvantages of GICs \u00b6 Investors use GICs for their: Guaranteed return of principal and interest as promised; Variety of products available to give investors choice; Available for as little as $500 and no out-of-pocket fees; Convenient, easy to understand, and easy to buy; and Penalties for early redemption are waived if the investor dies during the term-to-maturity. The disadvantages of GICs are: The low rate of return; The return\u2014paid as interest income and taxed accordingly; and Their illiquidity\u2014early withdrawals are significantly penalized. The cashable or redeemable GIC is a way to get around the liquidity issue \u2014 but at the \u201ccost\u201d of lower interest rates. 1.3.6.2 Where and how to buy GICs \u00b6 Available through financial institutions including banks, trust companies, credit unions, insurance companies, investment dealers, and specialized GIC deposit brokers. An application with deposit is made to complete the transaction. 1.3.6.3 Types of GICs \u00b6 Fixed-interest GICs pay interest at a guaranteed interest rate. May earn simple interest that is paid annually or compound interest that is paid at maturity. Even if the interest is not paid in any one year to the investor, the interest earned needs to be declared for income tax purposes. Cashable/redeemable GICs allows the money deposited to the GIC to be received at a date earlier than the maturity date. Interest rate is lower than when the investor is locked-in for a term. Escalating GICs increases the interest rate on its anniversary, or permits a withdrawal on the anniversary. Variable-interest GICs keep their interest payment in pace with general interest rates. Market-linked GICs links some of its return to a market index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index. The total return from the GIC has an upper limit. Generally not cashable/redeemable. Foreign currency GICs are issued in a foreign currency and pay a fixed interest. They are purchased by investors who believe the Canadian dollar will drop in value and the foreign currency will be worth more in Canadian dollars. Insurance GICs are also called accumulation annuities. They are exclusively offered by insurance companies and offer benefits based on its issue as an insurance contract (such as bypass of probate and creditor protection). 1.3.6.4 Returns and guarantees on GICs \u00b6 Principal and interest are guaranteed to be paid at maturity. Their returns are in the form of interest. 1.3.6.5 Risks of investing in GICs \u00b6 The GIC investor faces interest rate risk and inflation risk which are discussed later in this module. 1.3.6.6 Investor protection \u00b6 Investors are protected by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) but only if: The deposit is in Canadian dollars; The principal deposit is no greater than $100,000; and Up to $100,000 in coverage is provided for a GIC that is separate from coverage for an RRSP, RRIF, TFSA, etc. Insurance GICs (accumulation annuities) are protected by Assuris, the organization that provides investor protection to Canadian life insurance policy owners. 1.3.7 Mutual funds \u00b6 Mutual funds are created in two forms: An open-end fund issues units to its investors in proportion to the amount they have invested; A closed-end fund has a fixed number of shares, which it issues to its investors. Closed-end funds are not described in this module. The open-end mutual funds pool the deposits of investors. Just like with segregated funds, the mutual fund manager uses the pool of money to acquire investments according to the type of fund they manage. For example, money deposited to a bond fund is used by the mutual fund manager to buy a wide range of bonds; There are thousands of mutual funds available for investment. The challenge for the investor and his financial advisor is to narrow down the choice to one fund, or perhaps several funds, that will be the most suitable for the investor's investment objectives. Mutual-fund investors do not commit to a term for their investment. They may redeem their investment at any time and receive proceeds shortly after that. Investors in a mutual fund pay three types of fees: The management expense ratio (MER), which is expressed as a percentage of the fund's assets, is paid to compensate the managers of the fund, operating expenses of the fund, and taxes; The trading expense ratio (TER), which measures the trading costs of the fund, is also expressed in a percentage of assets. A higher TER is evidence of more frequent buying and selling of holdings by the portfolio manager. A sales fee upon purchase (called a \u201cfront-end load\u201d), or on a declining basis and paid when units of the fund are sold (called a \u201cback-end load\u201d or a \u201cdeferred sales charge\u201d (DSC)). DSC is declines over a period of years until it is elilmintaed. As of June 1, 2022, all provinces and territories except Ontario, will prohibit fund organizations from paying upfront sales commissions to dealers, eliminating DSC charges in those jurisdictions. The DSC will continue in Ontario. Low-load funds are also sold where a lower fee is charged at redemption. No-load funds are also available. Mutual fund managers for conventional mutual funds and exchange-traded funds use a standardized risk classification methodology. Standardized risk classification methodology uses standard deviation as the risk indicator to determine a mutual fund\u2019s investment risk level. This new approach provides consistency across all fund risk assessments and allows investors to easily compare the investment risk levels of different mutual funds. Example Using the standardized risk classification methodology, New Global Balanced Fund has a standard deviation of 10. This means the fund has a low to medium investment risk level. Georges is seeking a fund investment with this level of risk. Therefore, New Global Balanced Fund could be suitable for Georges based on the fund\u2019s risk level and Georges\u2019 risk tolerance. 1.3.7.1 Advantages and disadvantages of mutual funds \u00b6 What advantages are specific to mutual funds (and not shared with segregated funds)? The primary advantage of mutual funds compared to segregated funds is the lack of a 10-year term-to-maturity. This means an investor can easily enter and exit the investment without any penalty other than what must be paid as a sales charge. Mutual funds also permit their investors to withdraw money regularly. This can create an income stream for the investor, who can set up a \u201csystematic withdrawal plan\u201d to provide a regular stream of income from the fund. Mutual funds are also offered in the retail environment of banks, caisses populaires, and credit unions, which is a convenience factor not available to segregated fund investors. Some of the disadvantages of which investors should be aware are: Mutual funds are not intended to be a short-term investment; Tax complexities that arise in non-registered accounts require investors to monitor fund activity; Trailing commissions, or trailer fees (also called \u201cservice fees\u201d), are paid annually by the fund manager to sales agents. They are generally higher for funds sold with a front-end load, and for equity and balanced funds. The fee is a percentage (usually 0.25% to 1%) charged against the market value of the customer\u2019s total assets; A MER is charged by mutual funds for professional management services of the fund. This fee can erode returns significantly. The MER is calculated by annual operating expenses (which vary widely depending on the fund type) divided by the average dollar value of assets under administration. Client Relationship Management 2 (CRM2): This is a recent innovation in mutual funds with regard to new rules for disclosure to clients. CRM2 requires to provide additional written communication to clients, an annual report on costs and fees, and an annual report on performance. This is intended to ensure investors thoroughly and accurately understand their fund investment. 1.3.7.2 Where and how to buy mutual funds \u00b6 Mutual funds are widely available. The investor completes a form to open an account. The advisor completes a Know Your Client form based on the investor\u2019s goals and information to determine investment objectives and create an investor profile. The investor and advisor together choose a suitable fund, and the investor receives a simplified prospectus and a and an annual information form (AIF) that disclose the material facts about the fund that could have an impact on the value of the fund. For example, the fund could be an ethical fund. The simplified prospectus could reveal that the fund will not invest in tobacco products. Before buying the mutual fund, the investor must receive a Fund Facts document, which is intended to be an easy-to-read overview of the selected fund which outlines the potential benefits, risks and costs of investing in a mutual fund. Fund units can be bought and sold any time at market value. The unit value of money market funds is fixed. 1.3.7.3 Types of mutual funds \u00b6 Mutual funds are available in the same categories as segregated funds: Cash including funds in the money market; Fixed-income (for example, bonds); Equity (for example, stocks); Commodity (for example, oil); and Other. Funds may also be categorized by a geographical location in which investment is based, or whether the market is developed or emerging. Fund types are detailed in Chapter 2. 1.3.7.4 Returns and guarantees of mutual funds \u00b6 Mutual fund returns are not guaranteed. The return is determined based on the net asset value (NAV) of the fund. It is expressed as a percentage. The NAV per unit is the total net asset value of the fund divided by the number of outstanding units. For accuracy, returns should only be compared between similar funds (that is, equity to equity) and over at least the most recent five-year period to get a better picture of performance over the longer term. Distributions are a combination of earnings generated by securities within the fund and capital gains resulting from buying and selling those securities. Non-registered account owners may receive their distributions in cash or reinvest them in the fund. 1.3.7.5 Risks of investing in mutual funds \u00b6 Without guarantees, investors risk total loss of their investment. Otherwise, risk depends on the type of fund. For example: Cash-based funds face interest rate and inflation risk; Equity-based funds face market risk and industry risk; Fixed-income funds face interest-rate risk; Currency risk can be experienced by funds in which there is foreign investment. 1.3.7.6 Investor protection \u00b6 Like stocks, there is no protection against market losses in mutual funds. Both the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF) and the Investor Protection Corporation of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) cover MFDA members for up to $1 million in general accounts against the bankruptcy of investment dealers. MFDA members are the firms that distribute Canadian mutual funds. 1.3.8 Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) \u00b6 Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are a type of pooled investment fund in which investors receive shares in the type of fund in which they invest. ETFs trade the same way as shares on a stock exchange. ETFs are available as an indexed form or as an actively managed form. The indexed form tracks an underlying index, like the Toronto Stock Exchange. The manager chooses investments which align with the investment objectives with an actively managed ETF. There is typically a cost to ETF investors when they buy and sell their shares. This comes in the form of a sales commission which is similar to the fee charged when an investor trades stocks. Although some ETFs are available without a commission, firms that offer the \u201ccommission-free\u201d ETFs will compensate for the absence of commissions in other ways. They may impose the purchase of a specified number of units or a dollar value per trade or require the investor to a sign up to their online investing platform. Like mutual funds, an MER is also charged against ETF shares, however the MER is significantly lower than the MER of mutual funds or segregated funds. Also like mutual funds, a trading expense ratio (TER) is charged within the funds themselves for transaction costs. Active ETFs incur the highest TERs because more trading by management results in a higher total trading cost. Investors may also be charged a trailer fee by the financial advisor \u201cmanaging\u201d the ETF on their behalf. 1.3.8.1 Advantages and disadvantages of ETFs \u00b6 ETFs offer advantages that include: Diversification; Ease of trading; Lower MER than other funds; Professional management; Exposure to commodities provided to small investors Ability to react rapidly to market developments and speculation on short-term price; Ability for advanced trading transactions such as limit, stop loss, margin and short sale orders, options, and sector rotation. ETFs have distinct disadvantages that include: Trading fees, such as commissions, are usually charged on buy and sell orders. Low liquidity for infrequently traded ETFs or ETFs not traded in high volumes. Complexity of the investment. ETFs are complex and successful ETF investing requires an understanding of indexing and how stock markets work. The litmus test for investment suitability is the ability of the investor to describe how his money is invested, how growth is achieved, and the conditions under which his principal and returns are received. If an investor is unable to answer these questions about an ETF, then it may not be suitable for him. 1.3.8.2 Where and how to buy ETFS \u00b6 The investor needs an account with a securities dealer. ETFs are currently sold by ETF Facts. This document contains all the information the investor needs to base his buying decision and provides consistent disclosure about the investment, like Fund Facts does for mutual funds. However, since ETFs are traded on an exchange, additional content addresses trading and pricing characteristics. A prospectus is available to investors upon request. 1.3.8.3 Types of ETFs \u00b6 Many types of ETFs are available, that track currencies, industries, style (such as growth, value or market capitalization), bonds, dividends or real estate in Canada or abroad \u2014 and there are also other, more exotic ETFs such as inverse ETFs, which moves in the opposite direction of an associated exchange or index. Index-based ETFs track their target index in one of two ways. A replicate index-based ETF holds every security in the target index because it invests 100 percent of its assets proportionately in all the securities in the target index. A sample index-based ETF does not hold every security in the target index; instead the sponsor chooses a representative sample of securities in the target index in which to invest. Actively managed ETFs have a benchmark index, used as a standard to monitor performance. They must disclose the identities and weightings of the component securities and other assets held by the ETF each business day on their publicly available websites. This provides a level of transparency unique among fund investments. Managers have the ability to change sector allocations, time trades, or deviate from the index as they see fit. 1.3.8.4 Returns and guarantees of ETFs \u00b6 As with stocks, ETF returns are not guaranteed. Returns are earned as interest, dividends, or capital gains. 1.3.8.5 Risks of investing in ETFs \u00b6 The risk of the ETF is similar to the risk of its underlying index. Like mutual funds, they are classified by levels based on a range of standard deviation, which is a formula measuring returns. It demonstrates that the highest risk is experienced in those funds with the highest standard deviation. Thus, ETFs have market risk and may have industry risk, currency risk, and liquidity risk. 1.3.8.6 Investor protection \u00b6 Like stocks and mutual funds, there is no protection against market losses. The Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF) protects against the insolvency of the security dealer for accounts held by its members to specified limits. 1.3.9 Real estate \u00b6 Real estate for savings and investment purposes is the type that generates income through rent or mortgages. 1.3.9.1 Advantages and disadvantages of real estate \u00b6 Real estate diversifies a portfolio. Its primary advantages are the regular income it produces, the equity that builds in the property from mortgage payments, and ultimately the capital gain earned on the sale of the income property and benefit from the tax advantages on capital gains. The primary disadvantages are the large sum needed to begin (including the payment for the land/property, commissions charged on real estate sales and property taxes), as many as tens of thousands of dollars are typically required for a down payment; and liquidity risk, as real estate can be difficult to sell quickly. Real estate investors can also be exposed to interest rate risk if mortgage rates rise; and to market risk, when the overall market for real estate declines. Another disadvantage is the ongoing expenses in the form of property maintenance, property tax, and landlord insurance. The property must be kept up to preserve the investment, and to meet obligations to renters. Tax must be paid to local authorities based on the value of the property, and insurance will be required to protect against claims that result from premises liability, fire, smoke, water damage, and vandalism. These expenses must be tracked over the entire period of ownership to reduce the capital gain on the property. 1.3.9.2 Types of investment real estate \u00b6 Investment real estate encompasses: Residential properties: condos, apartment buildings, single and multi-family homes; Commercial properties (typically used for service businesses, such as restaurants); Industrial properties (typically used for industrial purposes, such as manufacturing); and Land for future development. 1.3.9.3 Returns and guarantees of real estate \u00b6 There are no guarantees to real estate investors that rents will be paid or property values will increase. Returns are in the forms of: Rent, taxed like interest; Capital gains, or loss, at the time of sale. 1.3.9.4 Risks of investing in real estate \u00b6 Significant investment liquidity risk, as properties are often not sold quickly at their asking price. Real estate that is mortgaged is also subject to interest rate risk, which affects the rate charged on the mortgage. Market risk can be experienced in the real estate market specifically if the location of the property declines overall, if buyers lose their appetite for certain types of properties or if the entire market falls. A real estate investor may experience interest rate risk on the mortgage for the property. If interest rates increase during the term of the mortgage, such as five years, the higher interest rate will be charged at the time of renewal. This could mean a higher mortgage cost, which might not be able to be offset by charging higher rent. 1.3.9.5 Investor protection \u00b6 There is no investor protection for real estate investors. 1.3.10 Canada Premium Bonds (CPBs) and Canada Savings Bonds (CSBs) \u00b6 Sales were discontinued as of November 2017, however there are still many bond holders. All bond holders will receive their guaranteed payments on redemption or maturity. These are bonds issued to small investors by the Government of Canada: CPBs are bought from the Government or financial institutions; CSBs are bought only through an employer\u2019s payroll savings plan; CPBs pay a higher rate of interest than CSBs. They are a debt form of investment with a term-to-maturity. 1.3.11 Group plans \u00b6 Groups that offer savings and investment plans to their members include employers, associations, and fraternal organizations. Group plans are most often associated with employers. They participate as the subscriber or administrator of the plan. The subscriber/administrator contracts with a group plan provider, such as an insurer, in order to offer a plan to employees. The employees participate in the subscriber\u2019s plan to accumulate savings for retirement. Participation by the employee may be mandatory or optional. A group plan satisfies a very distinct objective for each of its two participants. An employer uses a plan, perhaps together with other company benefits, to attract and retains employees. A potential employee sees the group plan as a point of differentiation when weighing up a salary-plus-benefits package offered by the employer during hiring. Then, as an employee, the plan is a way to save money for retirement. There are six fundamental types of group savings plans, and their features and characteristics are described later in this manual. 1.3.11.1 Advantages and disadvantages of group plans \u00b6 The members of a group plan receive assistance and encouragement to join their plan. In the case of employer-sponsored plans, the foremost advantages of joining are: To receive the employer\u2019s contribution to the individual plan; Forced savings: for employer-sponsored plans, contributions are taken directly from gross income and, depending on the type of plan are not subject to payroll taxes: Contributions made by an employer to a deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP) are fully tax-deductible to the employer and not subject to payroll taxes; Contributions made by an employer to a defined contribution pension plan or defined benefit pension plans are fully tax-deductible to the employer. Account fees are paid by the sponsor (in this case, the employer); To get better potential rates of return than can be achieved in an individual plan; To access to many investment tools and opportunities; To receive an account/pension statement every year. The disadvantages to members can be restricted investment choices and the inability to control plan changes made by the employer. The group plan administrator enjoys separate advantages \u2014 primarily: A significant employee benefit that can be used to attract top talent to the company; Range of plans available tailored to the objectives and financial capability of the employer; Tax deductibility of some of its contributions: Contributions made by an employer to a deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP) are fully tax-deductible to the employer and are not subject to payroll tax; Contributions made by an employer to a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) or a define benefit pension plan (DBPP) are fully tax deductible to the employer. The ability to change the plan at will. The main disadvantage to the sponsor of a defined benefit plan (DBP) is its obligation to provide a \u201cpromised\u201d retirement pension to members. This obligation is not present for defined contribution plans, which assist the employee in building a pool of savings for retirement but do not promise any specific benefit in retirement. Also, group registered retirement savings plan (GRRSP) contributions are subject to payroll tax. 1.3.11.2 Where and how to buy a group plan \u00b6 Group plans are marketed to sponsors by life insurance agents based on their needs and financial capacity. The group administrator coordinates a plan between the plan provider and plan members. 1.3.11.3 Types of group plans \u00b6 Details on these plans follow later in this module. Plan overview: Defined benefit pension plans (DBPP): unique because it is the only plan that pays an income during retirement that is known (i.e., defined) in advance to the group member; Defined contribution pension plans (DCPP): Also known as the money purchase plan; the income paid during retirement is not known in advance because it is a result of member contributions and investment choices; Group registered retirement savings plans (GRRSP): an RRSP for groups; each member\u2019s income at retirement will be based on contributions and investment choices; Deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP): profits of the employer are shared with employees to form plan contributions; each member\u2019s income at retirement will be based on contributions and investment choices; Tax-free savings account: a TFSA for groups to provide tax-free income; each member\u2019s income at retirement will be based on contributions and investment choices; Pooled registered pension plans (PRPP): a plan for small business employees and the self-employed to save for retirement; each member\u2019s income at retirement will be based on contributions and investment choices. (Note that PRPP legislation varies from province to province.) 1.3.11.4 Returns and guarantees of group plans \u00b6 Payments received from a group plan are taxed as interest income. A defined benefit pension plan (DBPP) offers a guaranteed income in retirement but only if the plan is fully funded. A fully funded plan is one in which the sponsor has made all the contributions to the plan for all plan members according to the actuarial obligation of the plan. Some employers have pension shortfalls because they have not made the required contributions. This means their pension liabilities are greater than their ability to pay. Pensioners could receive less than the amount of pension promised to them. 1.3.11.5 Risks in offering a group plan \u00b6 An employer commits to contribute to the plan and pays the costs of administration. Business conditions may worsen and funding the plan may be difficult, creating a shortfall. 1.3.11.6 Risks in participating in a group plan \u00b6 When a plan member (an employee) is responsible for making his own investment decisions, as he would in a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) or a group registered retirement savings plan (GRRSP), then he faces investment risks such as interest rate risk, inflation risk, and market risk. The savings in a group plan are locked-in until retirement. This means that, unlike investing in an RRSP, there is no spending flexibility because withdrawals cannot be made before retirement. All provinces provide \u201cunlocking\u201d provisions in the event of financial hardship or other proven need, but the retiree must prove that the funds are needed. This is a good reason for an individual who is enrolled in a locked-in plan to also save in a plan that can provide immediate access to funds, such as an RRSP or a TFSA. 1.3.11.7 Plan member protection \u00b6 Provinces and territories administer pensions through their financial institutions commissions or the government ministry responsible for the pension benefits act in their jurisdiction. These acts protect the rights and benefits of plan members. Some jurisdictions provide a guaranteed minimum income to plan beneficiaries who experience shortfalls due to underfunding. For example, in Ontario, the Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund insures pensions up to $1,500/month. 1.4 Risks of Investing \u00b6 Investing carries many risks. The individual has control over some risks and no control over others. 1.4.1 Economy as a whole \u00b6 An investment can be affected by macroeconomic factors (which affect an economy as a whole). This is economic risk, which also includes political and legal risk. Economic risk factors include regional, national and global factors; for example, change in government regulation, political upheaval. 1.4.2 Equity risk \u00b6 Anyone who invests in stocks listed on the stock market, directly or indirectly through equity funds, faces equity risk. Stock prices are established in the market and represented by stock trading exchanges such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index. The market price of all stocks is in a constant state of flux, rising and falling according to supply and demand. Equity risk is the risk of loss because the stock price falls. 1.4.3 Inflation risk \u00b6 Inflation risk is also known as purchasing power risk. Inflation is an increase in the cost of goods and services as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). To calculate the real rate of return of an investment, inflation has to be factored in. When the rate of return is lower than the rate of inflation, the investor suffers a loss in purchasing power. This means that the same amount of cash will be able to purchase fewer goods in the future due to the higher prices. Inflation compounds year over year as prices are inflated over already inflated prices. This makes long-term investments especially vulnerable to inflation risk. Investments that are most affected by inflation are those whose returns are tied to a specified rate of interest, such as cash in savings accounts, GICs, bonds, and money market funds. Annuities also experience inflation risk. Segregated funds that experience inflation risk are money market funds, and those invested in bonds. To avoid or decrease inflation risk, the return on an investment must be at a minimum equal to the rate of inflation. Thus, the investors\u2019 funds increase in proportion to inflation. Example Assume that the average rate of return on a one-year Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) on sale today is 2.20%. The inflation rate for this year is 1.8%. Therefore, if we assume the inflation rate will be the same for the next year, the real rate of return on the GIC is 0.4% (2.20% \u2013 1.8%). The GIC is barely keeping ahead of inflation. 1.4.4 Interest rate risk \u00b6 If an investment that pays interest is locked into a fixed interest rate, then an investor cannot take advantage of higher interest rates if interest rates increase. This is interest rate risk, inherent in all investments that pay fixed rates of interest. Interest rate risk is experienced with inflation risk. Interest rate risk occurs in bond pricing. The market value of a bond is less when interest rates rise. As interest rates rise, bond prices decline, and as interest rates fall, bond prices go up. Example Assume that the interest earned on a three-year GIC is 3.00%. The interest rate that applies to GICs increases to 3.40% nine months after the GIC is purchased. The investor cannot benefit from the rise in interest rates. He is tied to the lowest rate for the balance of the term. 1.4.5 Market risk \u00b6 Market risk is the risk of a downturn in the total financial market. An economic event or a recession, a major natural disaster, or terrorist attack are all examples of events that can trigger market risk. A diversified portfolio may not protect an investor as market risk could affect many or all asset classes. Example When the coronavirus pandemic started seriously impacting North America in March 2020, creating fear and uncertainty, there were negative effects on both the equity and bond markets. On March 12, 2020, the S&P/TSX Composite Index had its biggest single-day decline since 1940, losing 12.34%, a loss of 1,761.64 points. The bond market had already plummeted during February and early March, reaching its low point on March 9. Markets around the world all re-acted to the pandemic with huge declines. For geopolitical reasons, the price of oil had already fallen 51.6% during the previous year. In February 2020, the price of Brent crude was US $55.66 per barrel; in March it was US $32.01. As of the time of writing, July 2020, Canadian residential real estate has not experienced price declines due to the pandemic. However, the commercial market faces an uncertain future as office vacancy rates rise due to employees permanently working from home. This may affect investors in the real estate market. The pandemic illustrates how unknown and unpredictable forces can control markets, and how investors experience market risk.The pandemic will continue to affect economic activity and growth for the foreseeable. 1.4.6 Liquidity risk \u00b6 Liquidity risk is the risk that an investment cannot be easily converted into cash; or that an investment cannot be sold without affecting the value of the asset or investment. Real estate is an asset with liquidity risk. Annuities have liquidity risk. They may be surrendered, but withdrawal penalties and market value adjustments will drop the value of the investment. 1.4.7 Foreign exchange risk \u00b6 Foreign exchange risk is also known as currency risk. This is the risk created by currency fluctuations when the price of one currency changes relative to another. Investors or companies with assets or business operations in foreign countries are subject to foreign exchange risk. Investment funds that invest in foreign countries face this form of risk. 1.4.8 Credit risk \u00b6 Credit risk is also known as default risk. It is the risk that a borrower will fail to repay a loan or other financial obligation. Credit risk is particularly relevant to bond issuers. Borrowers with the highest credit quality, such as the Government of Canada, have low credit risk. Low-rated bonds have low credit quality, and the credit risk is very high. Firms such as Moody\u2019s and Standard and Poor's rate credit quality. Insurance companies that offer exceptional financial security receive a top rating, such as AAA. C is the lowest rate. Insurance companies with a C rating has very poor prospects of offering financial security. 1.4.9 Industry risk \u00b6 Industry risk is the risk faced by specific industries, such as technology or mining. For example, the retail industry could face: Lack of consumer interest in products; Inability to control costs; Supply chain disruptions and supplier problems; Investments focused on investing in specific industries, which can include mutual funds, may experience industry risk. 1.4.10 Other investing risks \u00b6 Many risks, both general and specific are associated with investing. To determine if these risks fall within investor risk tolerance and risk capacity, agents and investors must understand the risks associated with investments.","title":"Chapter 1 Investment and Savings"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_1_Investment_and_Savings/#chapter-1-investment-and-savings","text":"","title":"Chapter 1: Investment and Savings"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_1_Investment_and_Savings/#11-investment-and-saving-principles","text":"It is important to understand the basics of investing before focusing on segregated funds and annuities.","title":"1.1 Investment and Saving Principles"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_1_Investment_and_Savings/#111-concept-of-investing","text":"What is the basis for the concept of investing? Investing can only begin when a individual has savings; savings can be encouraged by: Making savings an item in the budget by using effecctive ways like pre-authorized contribution (PAC) or pre-authorized deposit (PAD) to a savings or investment account; Save at 10% of take-home pay; Save exceptional payments - e.g: income-tax refunds and work bonus; Set up savings buckets that can include retirement, holidays, or big-ticket items. Investments may be: Guaranteed, in which some or all of the principal is guaranteed to be repaid to the investor; For some kinds of investments, some growth may also be guaranteed; Non-guaranteed, in which neither principal nor profit is guaranteed to be repaid; Examples of guaranteed investments include Guaranteed Investment Certificates, and some bonds; Examples of non-guaranteed investments include stocks, mutual funds, and real estate. Example Jean is 78 years old and relies on the returns from her investments to generate income to support her in retirement. Her investments, combined with her pensions, allow her to live comfortably. Jean feels that she cannot afford to risk her invested money in an investment that would not pay both her principal plus the stated return. Therefore, Jean chooses guaranteed investments to ensure that she will not experience losses.","title":"1.1.1 Concept of investing"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_1_Investment_and_Savings/#112-investment-basics","text":"Some investment fundamentals are essential to understand how investing works, how returns are generated for investors, and how investors manage risk.","title":"1.1.2 Investment basics"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_1_Investment_and_Savings/#1121-compounding-compound-interest","text":"Compounding refers to earning interest on an investment. When the interest is paid, it is reinvested in the investment. The next interest payment is based on the principal and interest already received. As a result, the investor earns interest on interest. This form of interest is called compound interest. Withdrawals reduce the effect of compounding. To maximize compounding, all investment returns must be reinvested. As Table 1.1 shows, compound interest achieves escalated investment growth. Table 1.1 Investment growth escalated by compound interest Since compounding works better over a longer time period, younger investors have an advantage. This is why advisors recommend that individuals start saving as early in life as possible. Compounding can also work negatively. For example, costs, such as debt with unpaid balances where interest is charged, can also compound.","title":"1.1.2.1 Compounding (compound interest)"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_1_Investment_and_Savings/#1122-investment-returns","text":"All investments have one of three types of return: Investment returns can be positive and generate profits; Returns can be neutral where an investor receives the original principal, but no profit; Returns can be negative where the investor loses money on the investment\u2014this is a risk of investing. The \u201crate of return\u201d is expressed as a percentage of the principal or amount invested. This percentage can be positive or negative depending on the performance of the investment. Example Salim invests $10,000 but receives $11,000 when he sells the investment. The $1,000 profit ( $11,000 \u2013 $10,000) is a 10% rate of return ( $1,000 \u00f7 $10,000). In some cases, investors may be informed of the expected rate of return on an investment before they invest. In others, it is impossible to tell investors what to expect because the return is unknown. This is a characteristic of a risky investment. Investing involves a scale of risk which indicates the likelihood of the investor getting their principal repaid. Investment risk can range from very low risk at the bottom of the scale to higher risks toward the top, with speculative risk at the very top. The lower the risk, the greater the likelihood of receiving back all invested money. Speculative investments carry the highest level of risk. It is highly unlikely that an investor with a speculative investment will get back all of his invested money. On the plus side, speculative investments can generate higher returns (and a significant profit) than lower-risk investments. The risk/return theory is: reward those who are prepared to take greater risk with greater returns. Those who are able to take less risk are not similarly rewarded: less risk = lower returns. Returns are classified as nominal or real. A nominal return is the \u201cnamed\u201d or stated rate of return, before considering inflation. For example, a 2% return advertised for a savings account is a nominal return. A real return incorporates inflation. Its formula is: Nominal return - inflation = real return Example If the annual nominal return on a Guaranteed Investment Certificate is 3% and the annual rate of inflation is 1.8%, then the real rate of return on the bond is 1.2% (3% \u2013 1.8%).","title":"1.1.2.2 Investment returns"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_1_Investment_and_Savings/#1123-asset-classes","text":"Investments can have similar characteristics and be governed by similar laws and regulations.

Segregated funds are a good fit for a diversified investment approach. Segregated funds can be invested by their managers in a range of investments depending on the fund. For example, a segregated bond fund will invest in many different bonds that mature at different times, carry different risks, and pay out at different interest rates. Mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) share similar diversification characteristics as segregated funds.

For example, knowing how much needs to be invested today for a retirement nest egg in 10 years\u2019 time or calculating post-secondary education expenses. Present value tells us that if $5,000 is needed at a future date, less than $5,000 needs to be saved today because today\u2019s sum will earn interest and grow over time. Example Joe\u2019s daughter Sarah will be going to college in five years. He believes the cost of the first year\u2019s tuition and living expenses will be $28,000. He has just been paid for a large contract he completed. He needs to do a PV calculation to tell him how much of that money to set aside now to have the $28,000 when it will be needed. Present value can be calculated when the following are known: The future sum; The future date when the sum is needed; A specified interest rate between today and the future date. Financial calculators, available online, or in software provided by insurers, are used to calculate PV. PV is applied to both a sum of money and cash flows received over time. The formula for PV is: PV = FV \u00f7 (1 + interest rate)\u207f FV is the known future value and n is the number of time periods for the calculation (i.e., yearly, semi-annually, etc.) Example Julie wants to know how much is needed today to provide $5,000 in five years, given the current interest rate of 3%.

Insurers are required, by law, to set aside financial reserves so they can meet their contractual obligations for maturity and death benefit guarantees. Many types of segregated funds are available, to suit different investment objectives. With a segregated fund, investors deposit their savings to the fund (or funds) of their choice. The deposits create a pool of money, which is used by the segregated fund manager to acquire investments according to the type of fund they manage. For example, deposits to a bond fund are used by the segregated fund manager to buy a wide range of bonds. Segregated funds can be held in registered and non-registered accounts. Segregated fund investors may face a sales fee when they invest. This charge is paid once. It may be charged up front as a front-end load (FEL) as a percentage of the sum invested or the sales fee may decline over years (called a deferred sales charge) until it is eliminated.

That percentage is a measure of how the value has changed (up or down) since the return was last reported; The percentage is arrived at by comparing growth against last-reported value; The returns for segregated funds are posted monthly, every three months, year-to-date, one year, two years, five years, 10 years, and since inception. Example Phil receives a statement about his segregated fund that shows his contract has a value of $10,000. The next statement shows his contract has a value of $11,000. Therefore, his return for the period has been 10% (1,000 \u00f7 10,000). Return describes the form in which growth is earned: Note, these are described previously as interest, dividends, and capital gains; Segregated funds can earn interest, dividends, and capital gains, which are reinvested in the fund as they are earned; Registered account owners (that is, RRSP accounts) do not report returns on their annual income tax. When the time comes to make a withdrawal from their registered account, the sum investors receive is taxed at the same as income from interest, regardless of how it was actually earned (such as capital gains). This is true for taxable registered accounts (a tax-free savings account is an exception because it is not a taxable account); Non-registered account owners receive the returns in the form they are earned, for example as a capital gain, and report them in that form for income tax each year. There are two guarantees provided by segregated funds: Maturity guarantee: This guarantees the investor will receive a minimum of 75% of his investment when the contract matures; If the market value is higher than 75%, the investor receives the market value. Death benefit guarantee: This guarantees the beneficiary of the contract will receive a minimum of 75% of the sum invested in the contract if the life insured dies while the contract is in force. If the market value is higher than 75%, the beneficiary receives the market value. Example 1 June invests $10,000 in her segregated fund contract with a 75% maturity guarantee. When the contract matures, she will receive $7,500 ( $10,000 x 75%); or the market value if it is higher than $7,500. Example 2 Dane invests $10,000 in his segregated fund contract with a 75% death benefit guarantee. When he dies in year seven of the contract, it is worth $6,250. His beneficiary receives $7,500.

They are highly secure, widely available, and protected by Assuris. An annuity contract is set up between the insurer and the investor. The investor names the annuitant, the person who receives the income payments. Annuity payments are a combination the investor\u2019s principal and interest paid by the insurer. The annuitant may also be known as the \u201cannuitant grantee\u201d or \u201cpayee.\u201d The wording of different parties to a contract may differ from contract to contract. For this reason, it is very important to understand the definitions of an annuity contract. The amount received by the annuitant is called an \u201cannuity payment.\u201d An annuity payment is usually set or \u201cfixed\u201d for its term; changing interest rates have no effect. Several types of annuity do not have fixed annuity rates. Their payments are variable. Each guarantees a minimum payment. One form of variable annuity links to investment performance. Its payment will be the minimum payment plus any additional payment as a result of its investment performance. The other form of variable annuity, called an indexed annuity, links to the rate of inflation and increases payments in step with rising inflation. Therefore, its payment is a minimum payment adjusted for any increase in the inflation rate. The contract is assigned an annuity rate, which determines how much income will be paid to the annuitant: Many factors contribute to the annuity rate. The primary factor is the interest rate in effect at the time that the annuity is purchased. Other factors that may affect the annuity payments include the age and gender of the annuitant, and the amount of money deposited to the annuity contract. Annuity rates vary between providers. Annuities can be either: Fixed\u2014payments are guaranteed and will be received for the duration of the annuity; or Not Fixed\u2014payments are guaranteed at a minimum rate\u2014they are \u201cvariable\u201d and tied to the stock market, or \u201cindexed\u201d and tied to the rate of inflation. There are two main types of annuities: Payout annuities: All annuities that pay an income are classified as payout annuities. This is what most people are referring to when an annuity is mentioned. Accumulation annuities: In which savings accumulate over the term of the annuity to produce investment growth. On maturity, the investor has the choice of converting the accumulation annuity to a payout annuity.

The primary disadvantages of annuities are their lack of flexibility and interest rate risk: When annuity payments begin, no changes can be made to the contract. The investor will face penalties to make a withdrawal; The interest rate is set in the contract.

Bonds are also called a fixed-income security. Many segregated funds focus on bonds or include bonds as part of their portfolio. Therefore, it is important for life agents to understand how bonds work. A bond is registered electronically when it is purchased. It consists of a face amount (the principal invested) and a coupon rate, which represents the interest paid by the bond. A bond is like an IOU of a corporation or government. The investor loans the corporation or government money and receives the bond (IOU) in return. Bonds are issued with a maturity date\u2014as long as 30 years. During this period, the corporation or government compensates the investor for the use of invested money by paying interest to the investor. The maturity date is the date when the bond comes due for repayment by the issuer to the investor. On that date, the borrower (the issuer) repays the full principal amount to the investor. An investor can sell a corporate or government bond before its maturity date to another investor. An active market exists for buying and selling bonds called the secondary bond market. Bonds can be held in self-directed registered accounts and non-registered accounts. Bonds that are issued with a high credit rating can preserve and increase capital as well as provide a predictable stream of payments in the form of coupon or interest payments. A high credit rating indicates a low chance of the issuer defaulting on payments to investors.","title":"1.3.4 Bonds"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_1_Investment_and_Savings/#1341-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-bonds","text":"Why buy bonds? Bonds provide an income stream via their interest payments. They can also increase in value. The bond market is vast\u2014much larger than the stock market. This gives investors a wide range of bonds to choose from, and correspondingly, bonds are available across the risk spectrum. Investors choose among credit ratings, issuers, terms to maturity, and coupon rates (i.e., interest rates) to build a diversified portfolio aiming to get higher returns while reducing overall risk. To maintain investor confidence, repayment of the face amount and interest payments are guaranteed for government bonds issued by many countries because the issuing government has government revenue at its disposal to meet its obligations. Corporate bond issuers make a commitment to repay their investors for the same reason \u2013 they need investor confidence so they will be successful when they need to borrow more money via bonds in the future. There is a slightly greater chance that corporate bond payments will not be made since a corporation's fortunes can change quickly and a corporate issuer might not have the necessary capital at its disposal to repay investors. Corporate bonds run the spectrum of risk and investors who are prepared to take a higher risk are rewarded with higher interest payments from the bond. A disadvantage of bonds is that an investor must seek them out through a securities advisor, and little information is provided about price. This lack of transparency may mean that buyers overpay for a bond.

Credit quality: Bonds are rated based on the issuer's capacity to meet its financial obligations, whether that issuer is a government or a corporation. Bonds are rated according to the likelihood of repayment of face amount and payment of principal. The highest ranking bonds are called investment-grade bonds. They have an AAA rating. On the other end of the risk spectrum are bonds called high yield (because of they pay a high rate of interest) and junk bonds (because of their low rating, typically BB or lower). The return on investment-grade bonds is much lower than bonds with a higher risk of default. Price: Bonds are issued at their face value, called par value.

Closed-end funds are not described in this module. The open-end mutual funds pool the deposits of investors. Just like with segregated funds, the mutual fund manager uses the pool of money to acquire investments according to the type of fund they manage. For example, money deposited to a bond fund is used by the mutual fund manager to buy a wide range of bonds; There are thousands of mutual funds available for investment. The challenge for the investor and his financial advisor is to narrow down the choice to one fund, or perhaps several funds, that will be the most suitable for the investor's investment objectives. Mutual-fund investors do not commit to a term for their investment. They may redeem their investment at any time and receive proceeds shortly after that. Investors in a mutual fund pay three types of fees: The management expense ratio (MER), which is expressed as a percentage of the fund's assets, is paid to compensate the managers of the fund, operating expenses of the fund, and taxes; The trading expense ratio (TER), which measures the trading costs of the fund, is also expressed in a percentage of assets. A higher TER is evidence of more frequent buying and selling of holdings by the portfolio manager. A sales fee upon purchase (called a \u201cfront-end load\u201d), or on a declining basis and paid when units of the fund are sold (called a \u201cback-end load\u201d or a \u201cdeferred sales charge\u201d (DSC)). DSC is declines over a period of years until it is elilmintaed. As of June 1, 2022, all provinces and territories except Ontario, will prohibit fund organizations from paying upfront sales commissions to dealers, eliminating DSC charges in those jurisdictions. The DSC will continue in Ontario. Low-load funds are also sold where a lower fee is charged at redemption. No-load funds are also available. Mutual fund managers for conventional mutual funds and exchange-traded funds use a standardized risk classification methodology. Standardized risk classification methodology uses standard deviation as the risk indicator to determine a mutual fund\u2019s investment risk level. This new approach provides consistency across all fund risk assessments and allows investors to easily compare the investment risk levels of different mutual funds. Example Using the standardized risk classification methodology, New Global Balanced Fund has a standard deviation of 10. This means the fund has a low to medium investment risk level. Georges is seeking a fund investment with this level of risk. Therefore, New Global Balanced Fund could be suitable for Georges based on the fund\u2019s risk level and Georges\u2019 risk tolerance.","title":"1.3.7 Mutual funds"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_1_Investment_and_Savings/#1371-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-mutual-funds","text":"What advantages are specific to mutual funds (and not shared with segregated funds)? The primary advantage of mutual funds compared to segregated funds is the lack of a 10-year term-to-maturity. This means an investor can easily enter and exit the investment without any penalty other than what must be paid as a sales charge. Mutual funds also permit their investors to withdraw money regularly. This can create an income stream for the investor, who can set up a \u201csystematic withdrawal plan\u201d to provide a regular stream of income from the fund. Mutual funds are also offered in the retail environment of banks, caisses populaires, and credit unions, which is a convenience factor not available to segregated fund investors. Some of the disadvantages of which investors should be aware are: Mutual funds are not intended to be a short-term investment; Tax complexities that arise in non-registered accounts require investors to monitor fund activity; Trailing commissions, or trailer fees (also called \u201cservice fees\u201d), are paid annually by the fund manager to sales agents. They are generally higher for funds sold with a front-end load, and for equity and balanced funds. The fee is a percentage (usually 0.25% to 1%) charged against the market value of the customer\u2019s total assets; A MER is charged by mutual funds for professional management services of the fund. This fee can erode returns significantly. The MER is calculated by annual operating expenses (which vary widely depending on the fund type) divided by the average dollar value of assets under administration.

Inflation is an increase in the cost of goods and services as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). To calculate the real rate of return of an investment, inflation has to be factored in. When the rate of return is lower than the rate of inflation, the investor suffers a loss in purchasing power. This means that the same amount of cash will be able to purchase fewer goods in the future due to the higher prices. Inflation compounds year over year as prices are inflated over already inflated prices. This makes long-term investments especially vulnerable to inflation risk. Investments that are most affected by inflation are those whose returns are tied to a specified rate of interest, such as cash in savings accounts, GICs, bonds, and money market funds. Annuities also experience inflation risk. Segregated funds that experience inflation risk are money market funds, and those invested in bonds. To avoid or decrease inflation risk, the return on an investment must be at a minimum equal to the rate of inflation. Thus, the investors\u2019 funds increase in proportion to inflation. Example Assume that the average rate of return on a one-year Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) on sale today is 2.20%. The inflation rate for this year is 1.8%.

The market value of a bond is less when interest rates rise. As interest rates rise, bond prices decline, and as interest rates fall, bond prices go up.

These benefits will be discussed in the following pages. 2.1.1 Guarantees \u00b6 Segregated funds provide two guarantees that protect the investor from losing money on their principal: A maturity guarantee; and A death benefit guarantee. The maturity guarantee is a minimum return to the investor of 75% of deposits providing the investor\u2019s contract is in force until its maturity date, 10 years from when it began. The death benefit guarantee applies throughout the entire term of the contract. It applies when the annuitant dies during the contract, and is equal to, at least, 75% of the sum deposited to the contract. Withdrawals from the contract reduce the sum on which the guarantees are calculated, but the percentages (75%/75%) remain the same. Segregated Funds To best understand the guarantees, it is important to understand the roles of the parties to the contract. There are three parties: The first party is the person whose money (the principal) is deposited to the contract. This is the policy owner. He makes the investment decisions pertaining to the contract. He may also make withdrawals. The policy owner receives the policy proceeds when the contract matures and, therefore, is the person who benefits from the maturity guarantee; The second party to the contract is the annuitant. If the policy owner buys the segregated fund contract in an RRSP or a RRIF, he must be the annuitant of the policy. If the policyowner buys the contact in a non-registered, also called a taxable, account, the annuitant can be any person named by the policy owner; The beneficiary is the third party to the contract. The policy owner names the beneficiary of the contract. When the annuitant dies, the beneficiary receives an amount that is equal to, at least, 75% of the initial deposit. Therefore, the beneficiary benefits from the death benefit guarantee. Note: the policy owner is the person who owns the contract and pays the premiums or deposit. The annuitant is the person on whose life the contract is based \u2014 that is, when the annuitant dies during the contract, the death benefit is paid. The annuitant and the policy owner may, or may not, be the same person. Some contracts are structured to offer 100% guarantees. Often these contracts are based on a longer term-to-maturity, such as 15 years. Some modern segregated funds extend the maturity date to age 100 of the policyowner. Maturity and death benefit guarantees are always stated with the maturity guarantee first, followed by the death benefit guarantee. For example, when they are equal, the guarantees are stated as 75%/75%. When the maturity guarantee is less than the death benefit guarantee, the guarantees are stated as 75%/100%. If the market value of the contract at maturity or death is less than the guarantee, the insurer makes up the difference so that the amount paid out is equal to the guarantee. This is often referred to as a \u201ctop-up.\u201d The life insurance agent assists the client in choosing the contract that is most suitable for the investor\u2019s needs and objectives. 2.1.1.1 Maturity guarantee \u00b6 The maturity guarantee applies on the maturity date of the contract; The maturity date is usually 10 years, never less, from the time the first deposit (or premium) is paid to the insurer, although some contracts offer maturity dates longer than ten years. Contracts with longer terms to maturity typically offer a guarantee higher than 75%. The maturity guarantee limits investment risk for the policyholder by establishing a minimum contract value payable at maturity, known as downside protection. There is no maximum to what the value may be. This is called unlimited upside potential. On maturity of the contract, the policy owner may: Withdraw the value of the investment: If the market value is greater than the guarantee value, the policy owner receives the market value; If the market value is less than the guarantee value, the policy owner receives the guarantee value; When the market value is less than the guarantee value, the insurer \u201ctops up\u201d the market value to equal the value of the maturity guarantee. Extend the contract and leave the investment in place: A \u201ctop-up\u201d by the insurer is attributed to the account to bring its value up to the level of the maturity guarantee. If the contract is surrendered before the maturity date: It does not receive the benefit of maturity guarantees; The policy owner receives the market value of the units minus any sales charge that may apply. The market value of the units may be greater than, equal to or less than the value of the units when the deposit was made. There is no guarantee regarding their value; The maturity guarantee is reduced by withdrawals made during the term of the contract; The policy owner receives the market value of the units when the withdrawal is made; If a withdrawal is made during the period that the sales charge applies, the applicable charges are deducted from the withdrawal. Example Michael invests $10,000 in a segregated fund with a 75% maturity guarantee. The guarantee at maturity is $7,500 ( $10,000 \u00d7 75%). Scenario 1 At maturity, the fund has a market value of $8,360. This is greater than the maturity guarantee, and it is the sum Michael receives. Scenario 2 At maturity, the fund has a market value of $6,360. This is less than the maturity guarantee. Michael receives $7,500, which comprises the market value plus a guarantee top-up of $1,140 ( $7,500 \u2013 $6,360). Scenario 3 After four years Michael surrenders the contract. The fund has a market value of $7,120, and this is the sum Michael receives. Michael does not receive the benefit of the maturity guarantee because he has surrendered the contract before its maturity date. 2.1.1.2 Death benefit guarantee \u00b6 The death benefit guarantee is a near-duplicate of the maturity guarantee. It applies throughout the entire term of the contract. If the annuitant dies during the contract, the beneficiary receives an amount that is equal to 75% at least, (up to 100% based on the contract), of the initial deposit. The amount paid as the death benefit is the greater of the contract\u2019s market value or specified guarantee (75% or 100%)\u2014just like the maturity guarantee. And, just like the maturity guarantee, if the market value is less than the death benefit guarantee, the insurer makes up the difference between the two amounts so that the guaranteed amount is received. There are four advantages to the death benefit guarantee: The beneficiary is protected from fund losses throughout the term of the contract, just like the maturity guarantee protects the policy owner. The guarantee applies from day one of the contract and applies throughout the length of the contract. Segregated funds do not require medical underwriting. Therefore, an older person or a person in ill health does not need to be concerned about poor market conditions at the time of his death. The guarantee gives him peace of mind that his beneficiary will receive at least 75% of deposits. Like the maturity guarantee, there is no limit to how much the beneficiary might receive (more than the guarantee) if market conditions are favourable and unit values are high at the time of death. Withdrawals made during the contract can reduce the amount received by the beneficiary because the sum on which the guarantee would have been based is adjusted downward by the withdrawal. The death benefit may also be reduced by a sales charge. Some insurers waive the charge when the contract ends due to death. The value of the investment is further enhanced because it will not be subject to probate fees if there is a named beneficiary that is not the estate of the deceased. Example Keith is the policy owner and annuitant of a segregated fund contract with a 75% death benefit guarantee. Keith funded the contract with a $10,000 bonus he received from his employer. The death benefit guarantee is, therefore, $7,500 ( $10,000 \u00d7 75%). His wife, Patricia, is the beneficiary of the contract. Keith dies during the ninth year of the contract. Scenario 1 At the time of Keith\u2019s death, the market value of the contract is $12,640. Patricia receives that amount since it is greater than the death benefit guarantee of $7,500. Scenario 2 At the time of Keith\u2019s death, the market value of the contract is $6,300, which is less than the guaranteed amount ( $7,500). Patricia receives the death benefit guarantee of $7,500, which represents the market value of $6,300 plus a top-up of $1,200 ( $7,500 \u2013 $6,300). 2.1.2 Growth secured by reset \u00b6 Some insurers offer resets on their segregated funds. When it is offered, a reset allows the policy owner to take advantage of an increase in the market value of the fund. How does a reset work? As the market value of the fund increases, reset locks in this increased value. The maturity and death benefit guarantees are based on the new contract value. For example, an investor deposits $20,000 in a segregated fund. The 75% maturity and death benefit guarantees are $15,000 ( $20,000 \u00d7 75%). If the market value increases to $50,000 in the fourth year of the contract, the guarantees will be $37,500 ( $50,000 \u00d7 75%) if the contract is reset. Reset has two effects: It increases the value of guarantees; It changes the contract\u2019s maturity date. Reset changes the maturity date of the contract. The new maturity date of the contract is ten years from the reset date. For example, a contract that is reset in year 4 will mature ten years from that reset date (a total of 14 years since the date the contract was taken out). Some insurers offer an automatic reset on segregated fund contracts in which the insurer automatically locks-in growth of the account value. Others require the policy owner to make and implement the decision to reset. Therefore, reset may be attractive to an investor who is oriented towards fund growth and increasing his investment returns. However, reset may not appeal to an investor who has a 10-year time horizon for his investment. Not all insurers offer reset on their segregated funds. If reset is available, and it is up to the policy owner to make the reset decision, the owner is not required to reset the contract. The policy owner may not want to extend the maturity date of the contract. An additional fee may be charged annually to contracts in which reset is permitted. Also, an insurer may offer to reset on the maturity guarantee, separately from the death benefit guarantee. If so, the investor could choose to reset the maturity guarantee but not the death benefit guarantee, or vice versa. The insurer provides information regarding the number of resets allowed and the mechanisms to request or accept a reset in the fund\u2019s information folder provided at the time of sale of the fund. Example 1 An investor deposits $20,000 in a segregated fund. The 75% maturity and death benefit guarantees are $15,000 ( $20,000 \u00d7 75%). If the market value increases to $50,000 in the fourth year of the contract, the guarantees will now amount to $37,500 ( $50,000 \u00d7 75%) if the contract is reset. Example 2 Hassan deposits $5,000 to a segregated fund contract with a 75% maturity guarantee and 75% death benefit guarantee. Each guarantee is worth $3,750. ( $5,000 \u00d7 75%). After two years, the market value of the contract is $7,000. Hassan\u2019s contract offers reset and he chooses to reset the contract. This increases the maturity and death benefit guarantees to $5,250 ( $7,000 \u00d7 75%) and resets the maturity date of the contract. His contract now matures 10 years from the reset date (12 years from the time of the initial deposit). 2.1.3 Funding flexibility through ongoing deposits \u00b6 The deposit or premium is the principal deposited to a segregated fund contract. Deposits can be made as a one-time lump sum or as a series of separate deposits. When a series of deposits are made: The maturity guarantee may be applied to each deposit date or the date of contract is signed; When the maturity guarantee applies to each deposit date, each deposit creates a maturity date ten years from when the deposit is made; When the maturity guarantee applies to the date of the contract, deposits do not change the maturity date. Each deposit amount increases the maturity guarantee. Example Sandra has a deposit date-based segregated fund with a 10-year term-tomaturity. She deposits $2,000 as an initial deposit and then $2,000 every year thereafter on January 1 for two years for a total of three separate deposits. At the start of her contract, her maturity guarantee is $1,500 (1 \u00d7 ( $2,000 \u00d7 75%)) in ten years. At the end of 11 years, her maturity guarantee is $3,000 (2 \u00d7 ( $2,000 \u00d7 75%)). At the end of 12 years, her maturity guarantee is $4,500 (3 \u00d7 ( $2,000 \u00d7 75%)). 2.1.4 Guaranteed income \u00b6 A segregated fund contract typically returns its investment as a lump-sum payment. Alternatively, a contract may create a guaranteed stream of payments. Such a contract (or \u201cincome benefit plan\u201d) is available in two forms. The Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) plan pays over a specified period of time; The Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (GLWB) plan pays for life. The segregated fund contract may be issued in one of these forms or this feature may be added to an existing contract. Like all segregated funds, withdrawal benefit plans provide a maturity and death benefit guarantee. These plans are differentiated by the guaranteed payments they provide which is one reason that withdrawal benefit plans are attractive to retirees. Not all insurers offer contracts with regular withdrawal benefits. Also, there are many features, options, and restrictions that differ between these plans as offered by different insurers. 2.1.4.1 Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) and Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Bene-fit (GLWB) \u00b6 Both the GMWB and GLWB plans are based on an initial deposit or deposits by an investor to a segregated fund contract. Investors may begin making withdrawals immediately after entering into a contract, or they may choose to wait before starting to make withdrawals. Those who wait have two phases to their plans: A savings phase; and A payout phase. The savings phase is a period when savings accumulate: During the savings phase, investors receive the potential for increase in fund market value; They also earn a credit for every year in which a withdrawal is not made; The credit is based on a percentage of the initial deposit. For instance, the credit may be 5%; The initial deposit plus the annual credits form a base on which a guaranteed minimum withdrawal is based; Any withdrawals during the savings phase reduce the value of the initial deposit, as well as the corresponding credits and final guaranteed minimum withdrawal amount. The payout phase starts when withdrawals begin: During the payout phase, the investor receives an annual income based on the guaranteed minimum withdrawal balance created during the savings phase; The amount received is based on the payout beginning at a specified age and lasting for either a specific period, such as 20 years or for life; A lifetime payout will be at a lower rate than if income is taken for a specified period because the contract value is stretched over a longer time. This is similar to the payment made from a life annuity compared to a term annuity; Lifetime income appeals to those who are concerned about outliving their financial resources or who seek an income stream during retirement. This is also similar to the reasons clients choose life annuities; As withdrawals are received, the value of the contract declines; However, the annual income guarantee is not affected. The same annual income is received even if the market value decreases; Extra withdrawals can be made that exceed the guaranteed income payment. They may be penalized with fees; The payout value may be reset every three years. Reset creates a potential for increased income if the market value of the contract has increased, provided additional withdrawals have not been made; The payout also increases if more premiums are contributed after the initial deposit. One of the risks faced by retirees is the risk that they might outlive their financial resources. This is called longevity risk. Lifetime income appeals to those with this concern and is why individuals buy guaranteed lifetime withdrawal plans, and life annuities. Both products address longevity risk. 2.1.5 Professional management \u00b6 Segregated funds employ professional investment managers to provide investment management and advice. These managers are compensated by fees, which are part of the management expense ratio (MER) charged against fund assets to investors. The investment managers are hired by the insurance company offering the segregated fund or funds. The insurer retains the right to appoint or change a manager. A management change is reported to investors. Even though the fund is managed by professional investment managers, the life agent is still responsible for working with the client to ensure the client\u2019s objectives are being met in the fund investment. 2.1.6 Diversification \u00b6 Segregated funds are highly diversified investments. This means their managers use a wide range of investments suitable to the type of fund. For example, an equity fund is highly diversified because it holds shares of many companies. Diversification is a key to investing success. It lessens risk for the average investor since risk is spread over all the investments held in the fund. And, even in the unlikely event that all diversified assets in a segregated fund were to lose all their value, the segregated fund investor would be protected to a maximum loss by his maturity and death benefit guarantee. 2.1.7 Tax benefit of allocations \u00b6 Segregated-fund investing creates value for an investor in two ways: Market value of the investment may increase; and An investor may receive allocations from a fund. Mutual funds distribute income; segregated funds allocate income. When an investor makes a deposit to a segregated fund, the investor receives an assigned number of units. The number of units received is a result of how much is invested and their fair market value. It is essential for the investor to know the value of units when they are assigned if the investor wishes to follow performance and monitor an increase in the units\u2019 value. An increase may indicate that a reset is in order. The number of units assigned to the investor does not change unless additional deposits or withdrawals are made. However, unit value changes. It increases and decreases in step with the value of assets held within the fund. For example, an investor invests $1,000 in ZYX fund, in which units have a market value of $10; that investor is assigned 100 units ( $1,000 \u00f7 $10). If the market value of the units increases to $12, the investment will be valued at $1,200 ( $12 \u00d7 100). A unit value is determined for each fund offered by an insurer. The value is called the NAVPU or net asset value per unit (the term NAV, or net asset value, is also used). It is calculated as: NAVPU = (total value of assets - liabilities) \u00f7 number of units outstanding NAVPU is determined on each valuation day. For a fund investing in Canadian equities, a valuation day is when the Toronto Stock Exchange is open. Therefore, if a valuation shows an increase in NAVPU, the market value of the investment has increased. Allocations also benefit the segregated fund investor. Investment growth is generated in the form of interest, dividends, and capital gains. These earnings are not distributed to investors in the form of cash. If an investor wants cash from the fund, they must make a withdrawal by redeeming fund units. The interest, dividends, and capital gains earned by a fund are reinvested in that fund. They increase unit value and increase the investor\u2019s adjusted cost base (ACB) per unit. The ACB is a calculation that determines the tax cost of an investment to its investor. Increasing the ACB reduces tax when the units are sold. The investor receives the earnings on a flow-through basis. This means: Interest earned in the fund is reported for tax purposes to the investor as interest; Dividends earned are reported as dividends. Dividends from Canadian corporations are taxed at a lower rate than interest due to the dividend tax credit. Capital gains and losses are reported as capital gains and losses. Capital losses are used to reduce capital gains in the year in which the loss occurs. If a loss cannot be fully used in that year, it can be carried back to the three previous years or forward indefinitely. Capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than other investments. Example Henry invests $1,000 in WWW Segregated Fund Series B on September 1 in his non-registered account. He is assigned 200 units on the basis that each unit is worth $5 ( $1,000 \u00f7 $5 = 200). At the end of the year, a $100 allocation is made to Henry\u2019s policy and the unit value is fixed at $6 due to fund growth. Henry now has 200 units worth $1,200, and each unit is worth $6 ( $1,200 \u00f7 200). The ACB of Henry\u2019s policy is now $1,100: the initial $1,000 investment plus the $100 allocation. The $100 allocation Henry received is reported on a tax slip issued by the insurer to Henry as $50 in interest and $50 in capital gain. The interest is taxed at Henry\u2019s marginal tax rate. The capital gain is also taxed at his marginal rate, but only 50% of the gain is taxable ( $50 \u00d7 50% = $25). If Henry\u2019s marginal tax rate is 36%, he pays $18 tax on the interest he receives ( $50 \u00d7 36% = $18). He pays $9 income tax on the capital gain ( $25 \u00d7 36% = $9). 2.1.8 Switches between funds \u00b6 An investor who wants to switch their account value from one segregated fund to another may do so. Why would an investor switch? To a fund that better matches the investor\u2019s risk tolerance; For better performance; For lower fees, such as MER; For a fund that better suits their investment objectives. The investor must be provided with the same information documents for the new fund as were received at the initial purchase before the switch occurs. This includes both the information folder and Fund Facts for the new fund. When the switch is made, the value of the existing fund units is determined on the valuation date, which is either the day of the switch request or the following day. This is the sum that will be used to acquire units in the new fund. There is typically a minimum amount that can be transferred. Contract guarantees are not affected by fund switches. The number of switches the investor may make per year without incurring a switching fee may be limited. Individual funds state their switching policy, including any fees for switching in the information folder provided to the investor. An investor may incur a tax liability when a switch is made. An investor who switches funds where each fund charges the same load (e.g., a front-end load (FEL), will not incur a fee for the switch). However, there may be a fee for switching between funds with dissimilar loads (e.g., a deferred sales charge (DSC) to a FEL). 2.1.9 Ability to withdraw (redemption) \u00b6 The investor enters into the segregated fund contract with the intention of seeing the contract mature in, at least, ten years, i.e., the term of the initial guarantee. However, if his financial circumstances change during the ten-year period, he may find he needs to make a withdrawal from the contract to receive cash in hand. A withdrawal is also known as redemption. A withdrawal can be made at any time. This provides investment flexibility. The withdrawal process begins when the investor informs the insurer of the amount the investor wishes to withdraw. The investor redeems the number of units that will provide the desired sum of money based on the market value of the units. The market value is determined at the valuation day following the request. The investor receives the money from the insurer within days of the valuation date. If the contract is issued with a DSC, the charge in force at the time of the withdrawal applies to the amount withdrawn. It reduces the amount the investor receives. For example, if the DSC applies for six years and is stated at 2% in contract year four, then 2% is charged on the amount of the withdrawal made in year four. The maturity guarantee and death benefit guarantee of the contract are reduced by the withdrawal. The insurer calculates the new guarantees according to the terms of the contract. A withdrawal may trigger tax. The contract owner receives a tax reporting slip from the insurer so that the withdrawal may be taken into consideration in the tax return for that year. 2.1.10 Exemption from probate fees \u00b6 Probate is a process in which the will of a deceased person is proven to be valid and the person appointed as executor of the will is accepted. It occurs in the provincial \u201chome\u201d court of the deceased and is finalized when \u201cLetters Probate\u201d or an equivalent document is issued. Probate fees are a charge by the province or territory against the value of a deceased\u2019s estate. Qu\u00e9bec does not charge probate fees. Probate fees must be paid by the estate of the deceased before any property can be inherited as specified in the will. These fees can significantly reduce estate value in a province, such as B.C, that does not put an upper-end cap on probate fees. Probate fees are not charged: To a trust; When a surviving spouse inherits assets; When the beneficiary of a segregated fund contract is not the estate. Instead, a named beneficiary receives the proceeds from the contract probate-free. A named beneficiary can include the spouse, parents, children, and grandchildren of the contract owner or annuitant. However, if the estate receives the proceeds, they become part of the total estate value and subject to probate fees. Probate also slows down distributions of assets. Because a segregated fund bypasses probate, its account value can be received by the beneficiary within days instead of the months it takes when an estate must go through probate. 2.1.11 Investor protection \u00b6 Assuris steps in to provide investor protection when an insurer becomes insolvent, and cannot meet its financial obligation to pay guarantees. Assuris facilitates a quick transfer of policies from the insolvent insurer to another insurer that has the financial capacity to honour guarantees and benefits. 2.1.11.1 Guarantee exceeds market value \u00b6 Assuris protection is needed only when the guarantees of the segregated fund investment at maturity or death are higher than the market value of the fund. In the event of insolvency of the insurer, Assuris guarantees will apply for guarantees of segregated funds. Assuris allows a segregated fund contract owner to retain 100% of his guaranteed investment if it is equal to or less than $60,000. For guarantees valued at more than $60,000, contract owners will retain 85% of guarantees or $60,000, whichever is greater. If the contract is worth $40,000, the contract owner will receive $40,000. If the contract is worth $60,000, the contract owner will receive $60,000. If the contract is worth $61,000, the contract owner will receive $60,000. If the contract is worth $100,000, the contract owner will receive $85,000. Example Mark has deposited $100,000 to his segregated fund account, and the contract has a 75% maturity guarantee. Therefore, Mark is guaranteed to receive $75,000 on maturity. When his insurer is unable to pay the maturity guarantee due to insolvency, Assuris coverage is applied. Mark is going to receive the greater of $60,000, or $75,000 \u00d7 85% ( $63,750). Therefore, Mark receives $63,750 since it is greater than $60,000. 2.1.12 Creditor protection \u00b6 A person or entity, such as a business, who is owed money by another, is a creditor. A creditor may make a court claim for money owed if the borrower fails to make good on payment. Segregated funds provide the potential for protecting their contract owners from the claims of creditors. This protection is provided because segregated funds are issued as insurance contracts and a claim will not be successful if: The spouse, parent, children, or grandchildren are named as beneficiary in the contract; The beneficiary is irrevocable; The account is a registered account. A person must not try to avoid creditor claims by investing in a segregated fund. A segregated fund contract must be acquired for the purpose of investment, not for the purpose of avoiding creditors. 2.1.13 Absence of medical underwriting \u00b6 There is no medical underwriting for a segregated fund contract. This means that the health of the contract\u2019s policy owner or annuitant is not assessed and is not relevant to issuing the contract. If the policy owner or annuitant dies during the contract, the death benefit guarantee ensures the beneficiary receives the guaranteed minimum payment. 2.1.14 Right of rescission \u00b6 The right to cancel a contract is known as the right of rescission. All insurance contracts provide this right. An investor may rescind a segregated fund contract in writing within the specific time limitation set by the insurer providing the contract. Two days is the usual length of time that is permitted. If the contract is rescinded, the investor receives the lesser of the amount of premium paid or value of fund units on that date if it is a valuation date. If it is not a valuation date, then the value on the next valuation date applies. 2.2 Types of Segregated Funds \u00b6 The Canadian Investment Funds Standards Committee (CIFSC) classifies all fund investments into categories by asset class. Its five asset classes are: Cash; Fixed income; Equity; Commodity; Other. This list of categories is helpful to start to understand the many types of funds since each class shares certain characteristics. Also, many funds have subcategories that narrow their investment objective. Why is it important to understand the classification of a fund? Classification is important so that funds can be correctly compared and aligned with investor risk tolerance. For example, if an investor has a low risk tolerance, then they will not be suited for a fund classed as an equity fund. A better choice will be a lower-risk fund, such as a bond fund invested in government bonds. Each fund is highly diversified. Top holdings are described in the Fund Facts document or information folder. Other holdings for each fund may be too numerous to list. Note that the actual names of funds often bear little relationship to the asset classes and categories defined by CIFSC. 2.2.1 Money market funds \u00b6 Money market funds are the lowest-risk funds and, correspondingly, have a low rate of return. Money market funds must invest at least 95% of their total net assets in cash or cash equivalents, such as Government of Canada short-term bonds or Treasury bills. 2.2.2 Bond funds \u00b6 Bond funds are a fixed-income type of fund. These funds must invest a specified percentage of their holdings in fixed-income securities such as bonds and Treasury bills. Fixed-income securities pay a specific return periodically and they return principal invested at maturity. Fixed-income funds may be categorized according to the duration of the bonds held by the fund. For instance, the bonds in a short-term bond fund mature in less than 3.5 years. Bonds in a medium-term fund mature between 3.5 and 9.0 years, and bonds in a long-term bond fund mature in 9.0 years or longer. Fixed-income funds are described in the currency of the security held in the fund (e.g., Canadian dollar-denominated securities in a fund refer to a Canadian fixed-income fund). Fixed-income funds are generally low-risk and have a low rate of return. Some funds may invest in securities with a lower credit rating to achieve a better return. These funds may be called \u201chigh-yield.\u201d High-yield bonds are also known as junk bonds and such funds carry much higher risk than traditional bond funds. 2.2.3 Equity funds \u00b6 Equity funds are also known as growth funds. They invest in stocks of publicly traded companies and income trusts to generate dividend income and increase in value. Stocks held in an equity fund may be diversified or concentrated in a particular sector, such as financial services. Higher levels of risk are experienced when an equity fund is concentrated in one sector. Such a concentration means the fund is then susceptible to industry risk in that sector. Fund growth is achieved when stocks held by the funds are sold at a higher price than their purchase price and by reinvesting dividends paid on fund holdings. The increase in price is the capital gain on the stock. There is a higher degree of risk with an equity fund compared to bond funds or money market funds. This is the nature of equity risk. 2.2.3.1 Equity funds by market capitalization \u00b6 The larger the market capitalization of a stock, generally the lower the investing risk. Funds are available as small-cap, mid-cap, or large-cap; each invests in its corresponding type of company. For example, a small-cap equity fund in Canada invests in Canadian companies that are considered small-cap. Market capitalization or market value varies significantly between countries. For instance, in the U.S. a large-cap company is valued at $10 billion or more, whereas it is valued at $5 billion or more in Canada. 2.2.4 Income funds \u00b6 Income funds are based on bonds and growth is dereived by the regular interest income and their possibility of capital appreciation. Income funds are not restricted to bonds, and some may also hold high-quality stocks. When stocks are included in the income fund portfolio, the unit owner may receive both dividends and capital gains from his investment. Both government and corporate bonds may be held in income funds. Income funds are a lower-risk fund. 2.2.5 Balanced funds \u00b6 Balanced funds invest in both stocks (for the growth potential they represent) and bonds (for the safety the category represents). Balanced funds are also known as balanced growth or balanced income funds: A balanced growth fund emphasizes stocks; A balanced income fund emphasizes bonds. The risk associated with these funds depends on how the balance is weighted. Stocks are higher-risk; bonds are lower. When there is an even split, risk is averaged out. Balanced funds suit an investor who wants some exposure to stocks but is not prepared for the volatility of stocks alone. 2.2.6 Target date funds \u00b6 A target date fund combines equity and fixed-income investments. The investor picks a target date \u2013 usually the date he intends to retire, but it can be any date or any age. Over the duration of the investment, the asset allocation gradually and automatically shifts from a higher to a lower level of risk as equities are replaced with fixed-income products. Target date funds are often a default option for anyone who is in a pension plan and they are a popular choice among less sophisticated investors thanks to their easy-to-understand concept. 2.2.7 Dividend funds \u00b6 A dividend fund invests in companies that have a history of paying dividends. A dividend is a distribution of company profits by the Board of Directors to company shareholders. Dividends are not guaranteed, but the obligation to meet dividend payments is taken very seriously by a company and its investors. Dividends received from Canadian corporations are taxed at a lower rate than interest income as a result of the dividend tax credit. This increases investor appeal. A dividend fund may also invest partly in bonds. Dividend funds are considered low to medium-risk. 2.2.8 Mortgage funds \u00b6 Mortgage funds hold are residential, commercial, and industrial mortgages. Mortgage funds are categorized as an \u201cOther\u201d type of fund. Low-risk mortgage funds are a type of fixed income fund. Default risk is associated with a mortgage fund. It is experienced when mortgage holders default on (i.e., fail to make, their mortgage payments). 2.2.9 Real estate equity funds \u00b6 Real estate equity funds must invest at least 90% of their assets in retail, commercial, industrial and residential properties. They earn income from mortgages and have the potential for capital gains as property values increase. Real estate funds own property; mortgage funds do not. Some funds invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs), companies that, in turn, invest in real estate. The risk of each fund will be a result of the types of properties in which the fund invests and their location. Real estate funds are particularly suitable for long-term investments because property values need to be given enough time to rise in value. Real estate is an illiquid investment\u2014it may not be possible to sell or sell at the desired price to redeem invested money. 2.2.10 Index funds \u00b6 An index fund mirrors an index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite index, and invests in the same stocks that are listed on the index. Therefore, if the index rises, the index fund will also rise. Its results will be slightly less than the actual index because of the fees that are charged to the fund. This style of investing is known as \u201cpassive\u201d investing as the investment manager mimics the index chosen for his particular fund and maintains the same securities in the same weight. There are many indexes on which funds may be based. They include equities, bonds, commodities, currency, and real estate among others. The risk of a fund is a result of the underlying market the fund tracks. 2.2.11 Fund of funds \u00b6 A \u201cfund of funds\u201d is a fund that invests in other funds. The purpose of this approach is to benefit from managerial expertise in other funds and to diversify. The fund manager decides which funds suit the portfolio based on the fund objective and the manager rebalances holdings as needed to maintain the objective focus. The risk of the fund is entirely a result of the underlying funds in the portfolio and its investment objective. 2.2.12 Specialty funds \u00b6 Some funds are created to appeal to specific investor wants and needs. They are called \u201cspecialty funds.\u201d Specialty fund categories, such as ethical funds, fill important investment objectives for their investors. Ethical funds provide an alternative for investors who for religious, political, environmental or moral reasons find the holdings of standard funds unacceptable for investment. Investors who seek ethical funds are less concerned about the risk of the fund since their primary goal is to support a cause or belief. Other specialty funds include emerging market funds or funds that seek companies that are struggling financially. The risk of specialty funds lies with the fund\u2019s objective and investment strategy used by the fund manager. Each one should be carefully studied to determine if its risk is suitable for the investor. 2.2.12.1 Industry-specific funds \u00b6 Industry-specific funds represent the belief an investment manager has in the financial prospects for an existing or new industry, service, or product. The risk of industry-specific funds depends on the industry that forms the basis of the fund, its volatility, and its prospects. 2.2.12.2 Geographically specific funds \u00b6 Certain funds focus on investments: Within a country (e.g., Canada); Outside the boundaries of a country (e.g., North America); Of a selection of countries (e.g., international); Of a region (e.g., Asia); Of part of a region (e.g., Asia except Japan); Of the entire globe. Countries change in their appeal to investors over time. Some become very attractive investment opportunities while others lose their appeal. Political volatility is a risk associated with investing outside Canada and similarly developed nations. Currency risk is another risk of investing abroad. Investors who seek foreign opportunities should be well aware of the political situation and economic stability of the country or region in which they plan to invest. They should also monitor changes that might affect the investment (e.g., an election). 2.2.13 New introductions \u00b6 Funds evolve over time for a variety of reasons\u2014they may want to offer new investment opportunities or provide new features. Funds that have lost their appeal are closed and may be amalgamated with other funds. 2.3 Segregated Fund Limitations \u00b6 The limitations of segregated funds should be as understood as their benefits. The limitations of segregated funds will be discussed in the following pages and include: Risk to capital; Sales charges; Management expense; Penalties; and Age restrictions for acquisition. 2.3.1 Risk to capital \u00b6 The principal risk of segregated funds is that the investor could lose up to 25% of their capital when the contract provides 75% maturity and death benefit guarantees. Another risk is the fixed term-to-maturity period of the standard contract. This makes segregated fund investing a long-term investment. If the investor needs to make a withdrawal before the contract matures, they do not receive the benefit of the maturity guarantee and receive market value for the withdrawal minus any outstanding fees and charges, such as the deferred sales charge (DSC). Risks associated with segregated fund investing also depend on the types of investments held in the fund itself. For example, bonds are lower risk than equities. Therefore, a bond fund is lower risk than an equity fund. 2.3.2 Sales charge \u00b6 The charge paid by investors to compensate the agent is called a \u201csales charge\u201d or a \u201cload.\u201d Sales agents may be compensated for their time, skill, and effort through a direct charge paid by investors and indirectly through a trailing commission. The charge paid by investors is known as a \u201csales charge\u201d or a \u201cload.\u201d 2.3.2.1 Front-end sales charge \u00b6 A front-end sales charge is a fee charged at the beginning of the contract, known as its front end. The front-end sales charge is also called a \u201cfront-end load\u201d (FEL). The fee is charged to the client as a percentage of the amount the investor deposits to the segregated fund contract. It reduces the amount of investment dollars that go to work for the client. However, the client has no future fees to anticipate. Both the maturity guarantee and death benefit guarantee are based on the amount of deposit before the FEL is deducted. The amount charged as an FEL is usually negotiable between agent and client. The investor who pays an FEL pays no further sales fee if they redeem units during the term of the contract. For example, Jose has $10,000 to deposit to a segregated fund contract with a FEL of 5% ( $500). The contract value therefore begins at $9,500 ( $10,000 \u2013 $500). The maturity and death benefit guarantees are based on the $10,000. 2.3.2.2 Deferred sales charge (DSC) \u00b6 The DSC ais applied to a full or partial withdrawal made from a segregated fund during a set period of time. The charge is a percentage applied against the amount withdrawn. It declines over a number of years until it is eliminated. Each insurer has a schedule that lists the amount charged each year and the number of years the charge is applied. The schedule informs investors of what to expect as a sales charge if they proceed with a withdrawal or surrender. The DSC encourages investors to keep their investment and not to surrender the contract while the sales charge is in place. Example Josephine deposits $10,000 to her segregated fund contract with a DSC. Two years later she needs some of the money. She withdraws $5,000. The sales charge applicable is 4%. Therefore, she pays $200 ( $5,000 \u00d7 4%) as the DSC. 2.3.2.3 No sales charge \u00b6 Segregated funds that do not have a sales charge are called \u201cno-load funds.\u201d They may compensate for the absence of a sales charge by charging a higher management expense fee. 2.3.3 Management expense \u00b6 The management expense is the combination of the management fee for a fund, its operating expenses and taxes. These expenses are added together and expressed as an annual percentage of the total value of the fund known as the management expense ratio (MER). The management fee compensates the fund company for the cost of investment management by a portfolio manager, trailing commissions and fund oversight. Tax is charged as the provincial HST rate that applies where the investor lives, and is charged on management fees and administration fees. The MER of segregated funds is typically higher than the MER for an equivalent mutual fund. A segregated fund must maintain a reserve to uphold segregated fund maturity and death benefit guarantees. This is sometimes called the \u201cinsurance charge.\u201d MERs are charged whether the market value of the fund increases or loses ground. They reduce investor returns. Fund performance is reported after the MER has reduced the return. For example, if the value of units rises by 5% in a year and the MER is a 3% charge, the investment has actually only gained 2% (5% \u2013 3%) which will be reported to the investor. If the unit value falls by 5% in a year and the MER is a 3% charge, the value of the investment will actually have decreased by 8% (-5% \u2013 3% = -8%) which the investor will be apprised of. Higher MERs are associated with funds requiring more active management and decision-making. Low MERs are charged by funds such as index funds that require less active management and decision-making since the manager simply follows the index itself. The MER of a fund can be changed at any time by the insurer. Investors must be notified of the change. The effect of MER on returns is often underestimated by fund investors. It is essential they know what an MER increase will mean for future returns in dollars-and-cents, and not just on a percentage basis. This is good practice for agents and satisfies a requirement for disclosure. 2.3.3.1 Trailing commission \u00b6 A trailing commission is a sales compensation fee incorporated in the MER and is paid as long as the investor holds the fund. The trailing commission is calculated as a percentage of the market value of the fund. 2.3.4 Penalties \u00b6 Withdrawals and surrender of the contract may be penalized by the insurer. Such penalties are applied against the value of the contract and reduce the sum received by the investor. The policy of each insurer states their charges for withdrawals and surrender. 2.3.5 Age restrictions \u00b6 There are age restrictions for both the last age to establish a segregated fund contract and the last age at which a deposit can be made. RRSP: the oldest age at which a contract can be begin as an RRSP is 71 (deposits can be made until December 31 of the year in which the contract owner turns 71), then the RRSP is converted to a RRIF; RRIF: restricts the last age for authorized transfer, for instance from a roll-over of a spouse\u2019s RRIF, at 90; Segregated funds held in non-registered accounts and tax-free savings accounts (TFSAs): restrict the maximum issue age limit for deposits to 90. There are provincial variations among other types of registered accounts and age limits associated with each. 2.4 Segregated Fund Taxation \u00b6 The taxation of segregated funds is very complex. The following details are an overview. An investor should always seek tax expertise from a tax professional regarding taxation of a segregated fund account. Agents shuould seek tax expertise from their in-house professionals or recommend the investor seek independent tax assistance. Taxation of a segregated fund is based on two fundamentals: Whether the account is non-registered or registered; The form of investment income earned in the fund. 2.4.1 Tax on deposits \u00b6 Deposits or premiums paid into a non-registered account or a TFSA for a segregated fund purchase are not tax-deductible. Deposits or premiums are tax-deductible when paid into a registered account, except when the account is a registered education savings plan (RESP) or registered disability savings plan (RDSP). 2.4.2 Tax on allocations \u00b6 Investment income can be earned in both non-registered and registered accounts as: Interest; Dividends; Capital gains or losses; Foreign income. In a non-registered account, these forms of investment income are passed from the fund through to the investor. This is the allocation, as was explained earlier in this chapter. The investor receives a tax slip from the insurer and reports the income on his annual tax return. The investor also reports the capital gain or loss on the switch of units and certain other events that occur within the fund. In a registered account, these forms of investment income are allocated to the investor, but they are not reported for annual tax purposes. 2.4.3 Tax on withdrawals \u00b6 When units of a non-registered account are redeemed for a withdrawal, a capital gain or loss will be incurred. This must be reported on the investor\u2019s annual tax return. The amount of gain or loss is based on the adjusted cost base (ACB) of the units and their market value when they are redeemed. When a withdrawal is made from an RRSP or a RRIF, the institution holding the account retains a portion of the withdrawal as an advance against future tax owing. This is called a withholding tax. Even though the investor does not receive 100% of his withdrawal due to the withholding tax, the full amount of the withdrawal must be declared for tax purposes. A reconciliation is made on the investor\u2019s annual tax return that takes into account the tax already paid with the tax owing. Tax is applied at the same rate as interest income. The TFSA is an exception in that no tax is declared or paid when a withdrawal is made. When an RRSP matures (at the end of the year in which the account owner turns 71), the account holding the segregated fund can be rolled into a RRIF account. RRIF accounts require a minimum annual withdrawal. The first payment must be received no later than the year after the account was set up. Although tax is typically withheld on withdrawals by the financial institution holding the account. Only withdrawals in excess of the minimum are subject to withholding tax. The annual minimum RRIF withdrawal should not be charged the withholding tax. 2.4.4 Tax on maturity guarantee and death benefit guarantee \u00b6 Tax on the guarantees applies to the top-up sum contributed by the insurer if the market value of the units is less than their guarantees. When the segregated fund is held in a non-registered account, any amount paid as a maturity guarantee or death benefit guarantee top-up is taxable as a capital gain. When the fund is in a registered account, top-ups are taxable as income. A surviving spouse named as the beneficiary of a registered account can defer tax on the top-up if he rolls the proceeds into his RRSP or RRIF. Top-ups for guarantees required for TFSAs are not taxable. It is essential to check with a tax expert about taxation of top-ups.","title":"Chapter 2 Segregated Funds"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_2_Segregated_Funds/#chapter-2-segregated-funds","text":"","title":"Chapter 2: Segregated Funds"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_2_Segregated_Funds/#21-advantages-of-segregated-funds","text":"The many advantages of segregated funds include the following: Guarantees; Growth secured by reset; Funding flexibility; Guaranteed income; Professional management; Diversification; Tax benefits; Switches between funds; Ability to withdraw funds; Exemption from probate fees; Investor protection; Creditor protection; Absence of medical underwriting; and Right of rescission. These benefits will be discussed in the following pages.","title":"2.1 Advantages of Segregated Funds"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_2_Segregated_Funds/#211-guarantees","text":"Segregated funds provide two guarantees that protect the investor from losing money on their principal: A maturity guarantee; and A death benefit guarantee. The maturity guarantee is a minimum return to the investor of 75% of deposits providing the investor\u2019s contract is in force until its maturity date, 10 years from when it began. The death benefit guarantee applies throughout the entire term of the contract. It applies when the annuitant dies during the contract, and is equal to, at least, 75% of the sum deposited to the contract. Withdrawals from the contract reduce the sum on which the guarantees are calculated, but the percentages (75%/75%) remain the same. Segregated Funds To best understand the guarantees, it is important to understand the roles of the parties to the contract. There are three parties: The first party is the person whose money (the principal) is deposited to the contract. This is the policy owner. He makes the investment decisions pertaining to the contract. He may also make withdrawals. The policy owner receives the policy proceeds when the contract matures and, therefore, is the person who benefits from the maturity guarantee; The second party to the contract is the annuitant. If the policy owner buys the segregated fund contract in an RRSP or a RRIF, he must be the annuitant of the policy. If the policyowner buys the contact in a non-registered, also called a taxable, account, the annuitant can be any person named by the policy owner; The beneficiary is the third party to the contract. The policy owner names the beneficiary of the contract. When the annuitant dies, the beneficiary receives an amount that is equal to, at least, 75% of the initial deposit. Therefore, the beneficiary benefits from the death benefit guarantee. Note: the policy owner is the person who owns the contract and pays the premiums or deposit. The annuitant is the person on whose life the contract is based \u2014 that is, when the annuitant dies during the contract, the death benefit is paid. The annuitant and the policy owner may, or may not, be the same person. Some contracts are structured to offer 100% guarantees. Often these contracts are based on a longer term-to-maturity, such as 15 years. Some modern segregated funds extend the maturity date to age 100 of the policyowner. Maturity and death benefit guarantees are always stated with the maturity guarantee first, followed by the death benefit guarantee. For example, when they are equal, the guarantees are stated as 75%/75%. When the maturity guarantee is less than the death benefit guarantee, the guarantees are stated as 75%/100%. If the market value of the contract at maturity or death is less than the guarantee, the insurer makes up the difference so that the amount paid out is equal to the guarantee. This is often referred to as a \u201ctop-up.\u201d The life insurance agent assists the client in choosing the contract that is most suitable for the investor\u2019s needs and objectives.","title":"2.1.1 Guarantees"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_2_Segregated_Funds/#2111-maturity-guarantee","text":"The maturity guarantee applies on the maturity date of the contract; The maturity date is usually 10 years, never less, from the time the first deposit (or premium) is paid to the insurer, although some contracts offer maturity dates longer than ten years. Contracts with longer terms to maturity typically offer a guarantee higher than 75%. The maturity guarantee limits investment risk for the policyholder by establishing a minimum contract value payable at maturity, known as downside protection. There is no maximum to what the value may be. This is called unlimited upside potential. On maturity of the contract, the policy owner may: Withdraw the value of the investment: If the market value is greater than the guarantee value, the policy owner receives the market value; If the market value is less than the guarantee value, the policy owner receives the guarantee value; When the market value is less than the guarantee value, the insurer \u201ctops up\u201d the market value to equal the value of the maturity guarantee. Extend the contract and leave the investment in place: A \u201ctop-up\u201d by the insurer is attributed to the account to bring its value up to the level of the maturity guarantee. If the contract is surrendered before the maturity date: It does not receive the benefit of maturity guarantees; The policy owner receives the market value of the units minus any sales charge that may apply. The market value of the units may be greater than, equal to or less than the value of the units when the deposit was made. There is no guarantee regarding their value; The maturity guarantee is reduced by withdrawals made during the term of the contract; The policy owner receives the market value of the units when the withdrawal is made; If a withdrawal is made during the period that the sales charge applies, the applicable charges are deducted from the withdrawal. Example Michael invests $10,000 in a segregated fund with a 75% maturity guarantee. The guarantee at maturity is $7,500 ( $10,000 \u00d7 75%). Scenario 1 At maturity, the fund has a market value of $8,360. This is greater than the maturity guarantee, and it is the sum Michael receives. Scenario 2 At maturity, the fund has a market value of $6,360. This is less than the maturity guarantee. Michael receives $7,500, which comprises the market value plus a guarantee top-up of $1,140 ( $7,500 \u2013 $6,360). Scenario 3 After four years Michael surrenders the contract. The fund has a market value of $7,120, and this is the sum Michael receives. Michael does not receive the benefit of the maturity guarantee because he has surrendered the contract before its maturity date.","title":"2.1.1.1 Maturity guarantee"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_2_Segregated_Funds/#2112-death-benefit-guarantee","text":"The death benefit guarantee is a near-duplicate of the maturity guarantee. It applies throughout the entire term of the contract. If the annuitant dies during the contract, the beneficiary receives an amount that is equal to 75% at least, (up to 100% based on the contract), of the initial deposit. The amount paid as the death benefit is the greater of the contract\u2019s market value or specified guarantee (75% or 100%)\u2014just like the maturity guarantee. And, just like the maturity guarantee, if the market value is less than the death benefit guarantee, the insurer makes up the difference between the two amounts so that the guaranteed amount is received. There are four advantages to the death benefit guarantee: The beneficiary is protected from fund losses throughout the term of the contract, just like the maturity guarantee protects the policy owner. The guarantee applies from day one of the contract and applies throughout the length of the contract. Segregated funds do not require medical underwriting. Therefore, an older person or a person in ill health does not need to be concerned about poor market conditions at the time of his death. The guarantee gives him peace of mind that his beneficiary will receive at least 75% of deposits. Like the maturity guarantee, there is no limit to how much the beneficiary might receive (more than the guarantee) if market conditions are favourable and unit values are high at the time of death. Withdrawals made during the contract can reduce the amount received by the beneficiary because the sum on which the guarantee would have been based is adjusted downward by the withdrawal. The death benefit may also be reduced by a sales charge. Some insurers waive the charge when the contract ends due to death. The value of the investment is further enhanced because it will not be subject to probate fees if there is a named beneficiary that is not the estate of the deceased. Example Keith is the policy owner and annuitant of a segregated fund contract with a 75% death benefit guarantee. Keith funded the contract with a $10,000 bonus he received from his employer. The death benefit guarantee is, therefore, $7,500 ( $10,000 \u00d7 75%). His wife, Patricia, is the beneficiary of the contract. Keith dies during the ninth year of the contract. Scenario 1 At the time of Keith\u2019s death, the market value of the contract is $12,640. Patricia receives that amount since it is greater than the death benefit guarantee of $7,500. Scenario 2 At the time of Keith\u2019s death, the market value of the contract is $6,300, which is less than the guaranteed amount ( $7,500). Patricia receives the death benefit guarantee of $7,500, which represents the market value of $6,300 plus a top-up of $1,200 ( $7,500 \u2013 $6,300).","title":"2.1.1.2 Death benefit guarantee"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_2_Segregated_Funds/#212-growth-secured-by-reset","text":"Some insurers offer resets on their segregated funds. When it is offered, a reset allows the policy owner to take advantage of an increase in the market value of the fund. How does a reset work? As the market value of the fund increases, reset locks in this increased value. The maturity and death benefit guarantees are based on the new contract value. For example, an investor deposits $20,000 in a segregated fund. The 75% maturity and death benefit guarantees are $15,000 ( $20,000 \u00d7 75%). If the market value increases to $50,000 in the fourth year of the contract, the guarantees will be $37,500 ( $50,000 \u00d7 75%) if the contract is reset. Reset has two effects: It increases the value of guarantees; It changes the contract\u2019s maturity date. Reset changes the maturity date of the contract. The new maturity date of the contract is ten years from the reset date. For example, a contract that is reset in year 4 will mature ten years from that reset date (a total of 14 years since the date the contract was taken out). Some insurers offer an automatic reset on segregated fund contracts in which the insurer automatically locks-in growth of the account value. Others require the policy owner to make and implement the decision to reset. Therefore, reset may be attractive to an investor who is oriented towards fund growth and increasing his investment returns. However, reset may not appeal to an investor who has a 10-year time horizon for his investment. Not all insurers offer reset on their segregated funds. If reset is available, and it is up to the policy owner to make the reset decision, the owner is not required to reset the contract. The policy owner may not want to extend the maturity date of the contract. An additional fee may be charged annually to contracts in which reset is permitted. Also, an insurer may offer to reset on the maturity guarantee, separately from the death benefit guarantee. If so, the investor could choose to reset the maturity guarantee but not the death benefit guarantee, or vice versa. The insurer provides information regarding the number of resets allowed and the mechanisms to request or accept a reset in the fund\u2019s information folder provided at the time of sale of the fund. Example 1 An investor deposits $20,000 in a segregated fund. The 75% maturity and death benefit guarantees are $15,000 ( $20,000 \u00d7 75%). If the market value increases to $50,000 in the fourth year of the contract, the guarantees will now amount to $37,500 ( $50,000 \u00d7 75%) if the contract is reset. Example 2 Hassan deposits $5,000 to a segregated fund contract with a 75% maturity guarantee and 75% death benefit guarantee. Each guarantee is worth $3,750. ( $5,000 \u00d7 75%). After two years, the market value of the contract is $7,000. Hassan\u2019s contract offers reset and he chooses to reset the contract. This increases the maturity and death benefit guarantees to $5,250 ( $7,000 \u00d7 75%) and resets the maturity date of the contract. His contract now matures 10 years from the reset date (12 years from the time of the initial deposit).","title":"2.1.2 Growth secured by reset"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_2_Segregated_Funds/#213-funding-flexibility-through-ongoing-deposits","text":"The deposit or premium is the principal deposited to a segregated fund contract.

The segregated fund contract may be issued in one of these forms or this feature may be added to an existing contract. Like all segregated funds, withdrawal benefit plans provide a maturity and death benefit guarantee.

Investors may begin making withdrawals immediately after entering into a contract, or they may choose to wait before starting to make withdrawals. Those who wait have two phases to their plans: A savings phase; and A payout phase. The savings phase is a period when savings accumulate: During the savings phase, investors receive the potential for increase in fund market value; They also earn a credit for every year in which a withdrawal is not made; The credit is based on a percentage of the initial deposit. For instance, the credit may be 5%; The initial deposit plus the annual credits form a base on which a guaranteed minimum withdrawal is based; Any withdrawals during the savings phase reduce the value of the initial deposit, as well as the corresponding credits and final guaranteed minimum withdrawal amount. The payout phase starts when withdrawals begin: During the payout phase, the investor receives an annual income based on the guaranteed minimum withdrawal balance created during the savings phase; The amount received is based on the payout beginning at a specified age and lasting for either a specific period, such as 20 years or for life; A lifetime payout will be at a lower rate than if income is taken for a specified period because the contract value is stretched over a longer time. This is similar to the payment made from a life annuity compared to a term annuity; Lifetime income appeals to those who are concerned about outliving their financial resources or who seek an income stream during retirement. This is also similar to the reasons clients choose life annuities; As withdrawals are received, the value of the contract declines; However, the annual income guarantee is not affected. The same annual income is received even if the market value decreases; Extra withdrawals can be made that exceed the guaranteed income payment. They may be penalized with fees; The payout value may be reset every three years. Reset creates a potential for increased income if the market value of the contract has increased, provided additional withdrawals have not been made; The payout also increases if more premiums are contributed after the initial deposit. One of the risks faced by retirees is the risk that they might outlive their financial resources. This is called longevity risk. Lifetime income appeals to those with this concern and is why individuals buy guaranteed lifetime withdrawal plans, and life annuities.

And, even in the unlikely event that all diversified assets in a segregated fund were to lose all their value, the segregated fund investor would be protected to a maximum loss by his maturity and death benefit guarantee.","title":"2.1.6 Diversification"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_2_Segregated_Funds/#217-tax-benefit-of-allocations","text":"Segregated-fund investing creates value for an investor in two ways: Market value of the investment may increase; and An investor may receive allocations from a fund. Mutual funds distribute income; segregated funds allocate income. When an investor makes a deposit to a segregated fund, the investor receives an assigned number of units. The number of units received is a result of how much is invested and their fair market value. It is essential for the investor to know the value of units when they are assigned if the investor wishes to follow performance and monitor an increase in the units\u2019 value. An increase may indicate that a reset is in order. The number of units assigned to the investor does not change unless additional deposits or withdrawals are made. However, unit value changes. It increases and decreases in step with the value of assets held within the fund. For example, an investor invests $1,000 in ZYX fund, in which units have a market value of $10; that investor is assigned 100 units ( $1,000 \u00f7 $10). If the market value of the units increases to $12, the investment will be valued at $1,200 ( $12 \u00d7 100). A unit value is determined for each fund offered by an insurer. The value is called the NAVPU or net asset value per unit (the term NAV, or net asset value, is also used). It is calculated as: NAVPU = (total value of assets - liabilities) \u00f7 number of units outstanding NAVPU is determined on each valuation day. For a fund investing in Canadian equities, a valuation day is when the Toronto Stock Exchange is open. Therefore, if a valuation shows an increase in NAVPU, the market value of the investment has increased. Allocations also benefit the segregated fund investor. Investment growth is generated in the form of interest, dividends, and capital gains. These earnings are not distributed to investors in the form of cash. If an investor wants cash from the fund, they must make a withdrawal by redeeming fund units. The interest, dividends, and capital gains earned by a fund are reinvested in that fund. They increase unit value and increase the investor\u2019s adjusted cost base (ACB) per unit. The ACB is a calculation that determines the tax cost of an investment to its investor. Increasing the ACB reduces tax when the units are sold. The investor receives the earnings on a flow-through basis. This means: Interest earned in the fund is reported for tax purposes to the investor as interest; Dividends earned are reported as dividends. Dividends from Canadian corporations are taxed at a lower rate than interest due to the dividend tax credit. Capital gains and losses are reported as capital gains and losses. Capital losses are used to reduce capital gains in the year in which the loss occurs. If a loss cannot be fully used in that year, it can be carried back to the three previous years or forward indefinitely. Capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than other investments. Example Henry invests $1,000 in WWW Segregated Fund Series B on September 1 in his non-registered account. He is assigned 200 units on the basis that each unit is worth $5 ( $1,000 \u00f7 $5 = 200). At the end of the year, a $100 allocation is made to Henry\u2019s policy and the unit value is fixed at $6 due to fund growth. Henry now has 200 units worth $1,200, and each unit is worth $6 ( $1,200 \u00f7 200). The ACB of Henry\u2019s policy is now $1,100: the initial $1,000 investment plus the $100 allocation. The $100 allocation Henry received is reported on a tax slip issued by the insurer to Henry as $50 in interest and $50 in capital gain. The interest is taxed at Henry\u2019s marginal tax rate. The capital gain is also taxed at his marginal rate, but only 50% of the gain is taxable ( $50 \u00d7 50% = $25). If Henry\u2019s marginal tax rate is 36%, he pays $18 tax on the interest he receives ( $50 \u00d7 36% = $18). He pays $9 income tax on the capital gain ( $25 \u00d7 36% = $9).","title":"2.1.7 Tax benefit of allocations"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_2_Segregated_Funds/#218-switches-between-funds","text":"An investor who wants to switch their account value from one segregated fund to another may do so.

The investor must be provided with the same information documents for the new fund as were received at the initial purchase before the switch occurs. This includes both the information folder and Fund Facts for the new fund. When the switch is made, the value of the existing fund units is determined on the valuation date, which is either the day of the switch request or the following day. This is the sum that will be used to acquire units in the new fund. There is typically a minimum amount that can be transferred. Contract guarantees are not affected by fund switches. The number of switches the investor may make per year without incurring a switching fee may be limited. Individual funds state their switching policy, including any fees for switching in the information folder provided to the investor. An investor may incur a tax liability when a switch is made. An investor who switches funds where each fund charges the same load (e.g., a front-end load (FEL), will not incur a fee for the switch).

However, if his financial circumstances change during the ten-year period, he may find he needs to make a withdrawal from the contract to receive cash in hand. A withdrawal is also known as redemption. A withdrawal can be made at any time. This provides investment flexibility. The withdrawal process begins when the investor informs the insurer of the amount the investor wishes to withdraw. The investor redeems the number of units that will provide the desired sum of money based on the market value of the units. The market value is determined at the valuation day following the request. The investor receives the money from the insurer within days of the valuation date. If the contract is issued with a DSC, the charge in force at the time of the withdrawal applies to the amount withdrawn. It reduces the amount the investor receives. For example, if the DSC applies for six years and is stated at 2% in contract year four, then 2% is charged on the amount of the withdrawal made in year four. The maturity guarantee and death benefit guarantee of the contract are reduced by the withdrawal. The insurer calculates the new guarantees according to the terms of the contract.

The management fee compensates the fund company for the cost of investment management by a portfolio manager, trailing commissions and fund oversight. Tax is charged as the provincial HST rate that applies where the investor lives, and is charged on management fees and administration fees. The MER of segregated funds is typically higher than the MER for an equivalent mutual fund. A segregated fund must maintain a reserve to uphold segregated fund maturity and death benefit guarantees. This is sometimes called the \u201cinsurance charge.\u201d MERs are charged whether the market value of the fund increases or loses ground. They reduce investor returns. Fund performance is reported after the MER has reduced the return. For example, if the value of units rises by 5% in a year and the MER is a 3% charge, the investment has actually only gained 2% (5% \u2013 3%) which will be reported to the investor. If the unit value falls by 5% in a year and the MER is a 3% charge, the value of the investment will actually have decreased by 8% (-5% \u2013 3% = -8%) which the investor will be apprised of. Higher MERs are associated with funds requiring more active management and decision-making. Low MERs are charged by funds such as index funds that require less active management and decision-making since the manager simply follows the index itself. The MER of a fund can be changed at any time by the insurer. Investors must be notified of the change. The effect of MER on returns is often underestimated by fund investors. It is essential they know what an MER increase will mean for future returns in dollars-and-cents, and not just on a percentage basis.

Even though the investor does not receive 100% of his withdrawal due to the withholding tax, the full amount of the withdrawal must be declared for tax purposes. A reconciliation is made on the investor\u2019s annual tax return that takes into account the tax already paid with the tax owing. Tax is applied at the same rate as interest income. The TFSA is an exception in that no tax is declared or paid when a withdrawal is made. When an RRSP matures (at the end of the year in which the account owner turns 71), the account holding the segregated fund can be rolled into a RRIF account. RRIF accounts require a minimum annual withdrawal. The first payment must be received no later than the year after the account was set up.

Life insurance companies issue all forms of annuities. Banks and other financial institutions may only issue one form of annuity, known as a term annuity or \u201cterm certain\u201d annuity. Annuities are usually structured to pay a regular income to the person named as the annuitant in the contract, and this is typically their most important feature. The factors that influence how much the annuity pays to the annuitant are the quoted annuity rate, and guarantees on the annuity payment, if any. Annuities that pay an income are called \u201cpayout annuities.\u201d They are differentiated by whether the payout begins immediately (immediate annuities) or at a future date (deferred annuities). Payout annuities are purchased by the payment of a premium or deposit to the annuity contract by the contract\u2019s owner. The contract owner chooses a schedule for payments (also called the \u201cannuity benefit\u201d) and the duration for payments, either for life (a life annuity) or a period of time (a term annuity). Once annuity payments begin, they generally cannot be stopped before the end of the payment period. Most payout annuities are issued with a set, or level, payment unless the annuity is either an indexed annuity or a variable annuity. In addition to payout annuities, Canadians can also buy accumulation annuities. An accumulation annuity does not pay income, but provides a way to accumulate funds in the form of savings with a maturity date. At maturity, the savings in the annuity may be converted into a payout annuity or surrendered (paid to the owner) without penalty. Accumulation annuities provide investment security because 100% of the invested capital is returned to the investor. In addition to the security they provide, annuities are easily understood, provide income security, creditor protection, and estate planning benefits and protection for the annuitant in the form of insurance against the issuer\u2019s insolvency or bankruptcy through Assuris. 3.1 Advantages of Annuities \u00b6 The following advantages of annuities are explained in more detail in this section: Straightforward investment concept; Income security that can be adapted to the client\u2019s needs and situation; Creditor protection; Estate planning benefits; Annuitant protection (Assuris coverage). 3.1.1 Straightforward investment concept \u00b6 Payout annuities are the most common form of annuity and are what most people think of when they think of an annuity. The process of acquiring a payout annuity sees the following (note: there are many nuances available to customize payout annuities to individual needs): An individual wants to receive a regular payment from a lump sum of capital to invest. He wants to invest his capital without risk of loss, and, typically, looks to the annuity payments as a source of regular income, since his investment is repaid to him over time. The investor decides who is going to receive the payment from the contract. This person is called the annuitant. The insurer pays the annuitant on a regular schedule, that has been selected by the contract owner. Each payment is comprised of a portion of the invested capital plus interest. The starting point for payments to the annuitant to begin depends on whether the annuity is immediate or deferred. Once started, payments continue for life or the term of the contract: Life annuity: ends on death of the annuitant; Term annuity: ends on its maturity date. An accumulation annuity \u201cbreaks the annuity mold\u201d because it does not pay an income. It is a form of term savings with a maturity date. At maturity, it may be converted into a payout annuity or surrendered without penalty and its proceeds received by the investor in a lump sum. 3.1.2 Income security \u00b6 All annuitants have the security of knowing when to expect their annuity payment based on the schedule selected in the annuity contract. Annuities with a level, or set, payment provide income security because the annuitant also knows in advance how much each payment will be: The payments are guaranteed by the issuer; This knowledge allows annuitants to plan their finances and spending. This is one reason why many investors choose annuities for retirement income. Level payments are also a way the owner can control the amount of income to be paid to an annuitant when the annuitant is unable to manage his or her personal finances on their own. For instance, a parent could establish an annuity for a mentally challenged child with the assurance that the child would receive a regular payment of a known sum. The income security provided by an annuity may last for the lifetime of the annuitant, the lifetime of a spouse, or temporarily over a defined period of time. 3.1.2.1 Lifetime income \u00b6 When payments are paid for the lifetime of the annuitant, the annuity has been issued as a single life or \u201cstraight life\u201d annuity. Annuities can also take the form of \u201cjoint life,\u201d in which one annuity names two annuitants, who are usually spouses. They may be joint annuitants or co-annuitants. Payments continue for the life of the surviving annuitant after the first annuitant dies. A joint-life annuity can function like a pension to provide retirement income. When payments are provided with a lifetime guarantee, the annuitant (and their spouse, if a joint life annuity is selected) do not have to worry about outliving their money, even if they live for a very long time. 3.1.2.2 Spousal income \u00b6 An annuity can be used to provide income for a spouse using a: Single life annuity in which a spouse is named as annuitant; Joint annuity in which both spouses may receive annuity income and after the death of the first spouse, the surviving spouse continues to receive the annuity payment. 3.1.2.3 Temporary income \u00b6 A term annuity provides an income to an annuitant for the term or period of time stated in the contract. The payment period may be as short as a few years, or last for decades. A term annuity can be used to fill the gap between two dates, such as between the time when an employee takes an early retirement and the time a workplace pension begins. In this case, the term annuity would provide income after early retirement, and before the pension begins. 3.1.3 Creditor protection \u00b6 People who are self-employed, business owners, and professionals may find the creditor protection available through an annuity of particular benefit because they are more likely to find themselves in situations in which creditors could make a claim against their assets. When an annuity names specific beneficiaries, rather than the owner\u2019s estate, the amount deposited to the annuity contract is protected against financial claims made by creditors of the contract owner. The intention of the law, providing that annuity deposits cannot be accessed by creditors, is to protect the dependants of an insolvent contract owner from creditor claims. The value of the contract cannot be claimed by creditors when a spouse, child, grandchild, or parent is named as the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the annuity contract, or when an irrevocable beneficiary is named. Some annuities offer unseizable benefits, such as annuities funded by a transfer of a lock-in pension, coming from a locked-in retirement account (LIRA). However, if a contract owner surrenders their term annuity and receives its commuted value (as a lump sum), that lump sum does not benefit from creditor protection. To benefit from creditor protection, the contract must have been purchased significantly in advance of the owner\u2019s insolvency. This requirement ensures the owner has not purchased the annuity as an attempt to escape financial obligations to creditors. 3.1.4 Estate planning benefits \u00b6 Annuities offer a valuable estate-planning feature through the ability to name a beneficiary to a contract. When annuity payments are made to a beneficiary, those payments bypass the estate and are thus not subject to probate fees (except in Quebec). The beneficiary also receives funds faster than if they were waiting for the estate to be settled. 3.1.4.1 Insured life annuity \u00b6 An \u201cinsured annuity\u201d is the name given to a strategy that uses combination of two separate insurance products: a permanent life insurance policy and a straight life annuity. Its purpose is to protect estate capital. The insured annuity process is: A proposed policy owner identifies the sum of money needed on death to settle their estate; They acquire permanent life insurance, such as Term-100 (T-100) or whole life insurance, with a death benefit that is equal to the sum required to settle their estate; If the proposed policy owner does not qualify for life insurance, the insured annuity cannot be implemented, and the process must stop at this point. After the insurance policy is issued, the life insured buys a life annuity with a deposit that is sufficient to ensure that the annuity payments will, at a minimum, cover the life insurance premiums as they come due; Upon the death of the life insured (who is also the annuitant), the life annuity contract and payments end, and the life insurance death benefit is paid to beneficiaries and/or the estate. Beneficiaries do not receive the capital of the estate through the will, but because the insured annuity \u201cmatches\u201d the needs of the estate to the life insurance death benefit, they will receive an equivalent amount of capital from the life insurance policy death benefit, tax-free. Example Stephen, aged 60, wants to leave his two nieces a legacy of $250,000 each on his death. If he puts aside the $500,000 now, he no longer can spend that money. Instead, Stephen purchases a Term-100 life insurance policy with a $500,000 death benefit. He names his nieces as beneficiaries of the policy. Premiums for the policy are $1,000/month. Stephen then acquires a single life annuity using $200,000 of his savings. He receives about $1,000/month in an annuity payment. He uses the money to pay his life insurance premium. He has effectively \u201cbought\u201d an inheritance of $500,000 for the sum of $200,000. He still has access to $300,000 of his savings to use for other purposes, such as retirement. 3.1.5 Annuitant protection (Assuris coverage) \u00b6 If an insurer that has issued annuities is no longer able to meet its payment commitments, the policies are then transferred to another insurer that is willing and able to assume those payments. The transfer process is facilitated by Assuris, who also guarantees future payments up to specified limits. An annuitant receives Assuris protection on a payout annuity on the payment in full when it is up to $2,000 per month. For example, if a promised benefit is a level $1,000 per month, the annuitant will continue to receive $1,000 per month after the policy has been transferred to a new insurer. When a benefit for a payout annuity is more than $2,000 per month, the annuitant receives Assuris protection for the greater of $2,000 per month or 85% of the promised benefit. For example, if a promised benefit is $5,000 per month, the annuitant would receive $4,250 ( $5,000 \u00d7 85%). For accumulation annuities, Assuris protects up to 100% of the contract value, to a maximum of $100,000. Therefore, if an accumulation annuity value is less than $100,000, the policy owner receives all of their deposit value. If the annuity value is greater than $100,000, they receive $100,000. 3.2 Types of Annuities \u00b6 Many factors must be addressed while selecting the type of annuity suited to the client\u2019s needs and expectations and while preparing a contract. These factors are addressed in the sections that follow. 3.2.1 Purpose of the annuity \u00b6 As mentioned earlier in this module, the two core forms of annuities are the payout annuity and the accumulation annuity. The purpose of each type of annuity is very different, so it is important for agents to understand which type best suits which circumstances. 3.2.1.1 Payout annuity \u00b6 The purpose of a payout annuity is, as its name suggests, \u201cpaying out\u201d income. The income stream received from a payout annuity is a blend of interest and principal created from the deposit of capital to the contract. The payment amount is based on the annuity rate applied at the time the contract is issued. Payout annuities are available as immediate and deferred annuities with term, straight life, or joint life annuity payments. 3.2.1.2 Accumulation annuity \u00b6 An accumulation annuity is a form of term savings with a built-in maturity date. Accumulation annuities do not provide an income stream. Instead, their purpose is investment growth. Accumulation annuities are similar to a Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) but come with the features of a life insurance contract, such as the ability to name a beneficiary and creditor protection. The accumulation annuity credits interest of deposits on a daily, monthly, or compound basis. Daily interest is not a guaranteed sum. In certain cases, interest may be guaranteed over a number of years, such as one year, five years or ten years, because the annuity deposit is used to buy a fixed-term investment at a guaranteed interest rate. Interest applied to deposits increase the accumulated value of the annuity. Once the annuity has matured, it may be surrendered for its accumulated value or it may be converted into a payout annuity, which will pay a fixed amount based on the accumulated value and the annuity rate in force at the time of maturity. 3.2.2 Lives covered \u00b6 Once the fundamental purpose for the annuity contract is identified, the number of lives to be covered by the contract can be established. 3.2.2.1 Single life contract \u00b6 A contract may be issued to a person naming him or another person as the annuitant. If a person uses funds in his RRSP or RRIF to buy an annuity, he must be named the annuitant. The annuitant receives the income from the annuity contract for a specific period or life, depending on whether the annuity is a term-certain annuity or a lifetime payout annuity. 3.2.2.2 Joint life contract \u00b6 A joint-life contract, also known as a \u201cjoint and last survivor annuity,\u201d pays an income over the lifespan of two people, usually spouses. The two individuals named in the annuity are known as co-annuitants. Payments may be issued to both annuitants or one annuitant. When the first annuitant dies, payments continue to the co-annuitant, typically the surviving spouse. 3.2.3 Duration of the annuity \u00b6 An annuity is issued for a term (a period of time), a lifetime, or the lifetimes of two people. 3.2.3.1 Term \u00b6 A term annuity is issued to pay income to a specified age, such as to age 71, or for a specific length of time, such as 10 years: All other factors being equal, the longer the term, the less received in each annuity payment. This is because the income from the deposits must be stretched over a longer period of time; For example, Donald, aged 65, deposits $100,000 to a five-year term annuity. He receives approximately $1,700 per month in his annuity payment. If the annuity were a 10-year term, he would receive about $900 per month. When a term annuity ends, all payments cease because the annuitant has received the entire principal deposited to the contract, along with the interest earned on that principal. If death of the annuitant occurs during the term of the annuity, the balance of annuity payments is paid to a beneficiary as either: Monthly payments for the period remaining in the term where the value is paid in instalments to the beneficiary and is sometimes called the instalment refund choice; A lump sum payment that represents the present value of all future payments paid as a cash refund. This is also known as the commuted value of the annuity or the cash refund choice; or The amount that remains of the original deposit. For example, if the contract was funded with $100,000 and $75,000 had been paid out, the beneficiary would receive $25,000 ( $100,000 \u2014 $75,000). This is known as a capital protection guarantee. A Term Annuity-to-age-90 (T-90) is an annuity option available to those whose registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) is maturing, and the RRSP account must be closed. Using some or all of the value in the RRSP to buy a term annuity continues tax deferral on the money. Additionally, a Term Annuity-to-age-18 (T-18) is available for financially dependent children who are younger than 18 who receive the proceeds from the RRSP/RRIF of a deceased parent or grandparent. The lump sum in the registered account is transferred to an annuity for the child tax-free. The child receives payments from the annuity until, at the latest, the day before he or she turns 19. Tax on the payments as they are paid is paid by the child at his or her marginal tax rate. 3.2.3.2 A single life or two lives \u00b6 An annuity may be structured to pay an income over the lifetime of one person or two. When two lives are covered in an annuity, the annuity is called a joint-and-last-survivor annuity. Example Ted and Joan buy a joint and last survivor life annuity with $100,000. Ted and Joan are the policy co-annuitants, and the contract is structured to pay Joan 50% of the full benefit upon Ted\u2019s death. Ted receives $450 per month as his annuity payment. Joan does not receive a payment. When Ted dies twenty years after receiving his first payment, payments are then issued to Joan, and she receives $225 per month. When Joan dies after receiving payments for six months, the annuity ends. No further payments are made. 3.2.3.3 A shortened life \u00b6 An impaired annuity is a form of life annuity. An impaired annuity is issued when the annuitant has a shortened life expectancy due to poor health because of a serious disease or deteriorating condition. An impaired annuity can be bought for a single life annuitant or joint life annuitants when both spouses suffer from medical conditions that lead to shortened life expectancy. Impaired life annuities are also called \u201cenhanced,\u201d \u201cage-rated,\u201d or \u201caccelerated annuities.\u201d The amount of payment received by the annuitant is based on underwriting of their medical condition. The annuitant must provide a medical certificate proving substandard health. Once an impairment is proven, the annuitant either pays a lower premium, or receives a higher payment than someone who does not have a health condition because payments are expected to be issued over a shorter period corresponding to the shortened lifespan. 3.3 Funding an Annuity \u00b6 A policy owner may fund, or pay for, an annuity in a lump sum, in a transfer of a lump sum, or payments may be made over a period as deposits to the annuity contract. An immediate annuity must be funded with a lump sum so that capital is immediately on deposit with the insurer to begin payments within the first year of the contract. A deferred annuity can be funded with a lump sum or a series of deposits. 3.3.1 Lump-sum deposit \u00b6 A lump-sum deposit is made when funds are transferred from a registered or non-registered account to the annuity. The deposit occurs just once by transfer from non-registered investor savings and investments or from a registered account. Agents must be alert to indicators that a lump-sum deposit is an effort by the purchaser to launder money or finance terrorist activity. They should read and bear in mind the guidance from FINTRAC (Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada) specific to life insurance and annuity providers. 3.3.1.1 Transfer from a registered account \u00b6 Transferring funds from a registered account (such as an RRSP or RRIF) continues the tax deferral on the amount that is transferred to a registered annuity contract. Therefore, there is no immediate tax consequence for a transfer. When registered savings are the source of funding of the annuity, the policy owner and annuitant must be the same person. They can choose a life of T-90 annuity. Locked-in pension savings accumulated in an employer-provided or group pension plan. can be transferred only to a life annuity, including funds in a LIRA, LIF, or a PRIF. When a spouse transfers locked-in savings from a registered pension plan, LIRA, or LIF to fund an annuity, they must usually acquire a joint and last survivor life annuity. This ensures that if the pensioner dies before his spouse, the surviving spouse will continue to receive an income. That spouse can waive the right to the annuity in writing. 3.3.2 Regular deposits \u00b6 Deposits, or premiums, made on a regular ongoing basis can also fund an annuity. Annuity payments cannot begin for any type of annuity until after the last deposit has been made and the annuity is fully funded. 3.4 Annuity Income \u00b6 The contract owner of a payout annuity must choose one of the following on the application: Whether the annuity income payments begin immediately or at a selected future date (that is, payments are deferred); and Whether the payments will be a level amount or variable amount. 3.4.1 Immediate income \u00b6 Payments can begin immediately when a lump sum funds the annuity. The lump sum deposit followed by immediate payments is an immediate annuity. The annuitant receives their first payment at the next payment date after the contract is finalized based on the payment schedule that was selected. This may be the next month, three months, half year, or year. 3.4.2 Deferred income \u00b6 A policy owner who selects their payments to begin at a future date has a deferred annuity. There are two phases to the deferred annuity: During the accumulation phase, the annuitant either deposits a lump sum to the contract or pays regular premiums. Deposits held by the insurer earn investment income. The income (or payout) phase begins at the end of the deferral period, for instance, ten years after the first deposit. A maximum length of time permitted for the deferral will be stated in the contract. 3.4.3 Level income \u00b6 A level payment is a payment that is the same for the duration of the annuity. The annuitant knows exactly the sum to expect in each payment. 3.4.4 Indexed income \u00b6 In contrast to annuities with level payments, indexed income provides payments that increase over the payment period to keep in step with inflation, thus maintaining the purchasing power of the annuity payments. Indexing an annuity increases payments annually by a percentage selected by the policy owner. Therefore, income increases year over year to keep pace with rising costs. The maximum amount of yearly increase is capped, for instance at 4%. 3.4.5 Variable income \u00b6 A variable income annuity is an immediate life annuity which also allows the annuitant to earn investment returns that are linked to market performance. A market-linked return is a return linked to performance of a market index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index. The annuitant who has a variable income annuity is paid on the basis of annuity units. The annuitant receives a set number of units at the time the deposit is made. The contract owner chooses the investment mix on which unit is based, and also selects a rate of return that must be attained before increase. If the value of the units increases above the chosen rate of return, the annuitant\u2019s income increases as the payments increase in accordance with the rate of return. If the value of the units declines, the annuitant\u2019s income will fall as the payments decrease. The variable income annuity mitigates interest risk and inflation risk since returns are intended to increase with the market. However, since the contract owner will face equity risk, he must have the required level of risk tolerance that matches equity investing. 3.5 Factors Affecting Annuity Payments \u00b6 Many factors affect the amount received as the annuity payment. Annuity quotes and rates are specific for each person. Buyers will often comparison-shop between issuers to get the best rate. 3.5.1 Annuity rate \u00b6 The annuity rate is a dollar figure quoted to future policy owners that they will receive as their annuity payment. It is based on the current interest rate and other factors that are specific to the annuitant and to how the annuity contract is structured. In effect, the annuity rate represents the return on the sum invested in the annuity. For example, Bernadette purchases an annuity contract with an annuity rate of $6,000 per $100,000. If she deposits $300,000 in the annuity, she will receive payments of $18,000 (( $300,000 \u00f7 $100,000) \u00d7 $6,000) annually. The annuity rate also takes into consideration costs that are applied against the contract, such as commission and insurer expenses. Rates differ between issuers since they do not all use the same interest rate or calculation of cost factors. 3.5.1.1 Interest rate \u00b6 The interest rate in effect at the time the contract is issued is a major factor in determining the payment to the annuitant. The interest rate assigned to the annuity never changes over its duration (that is, if interest rates change during the term of the annuity, the annuity payment does not change in response). It is based on the prevailing interest rate offered in other forms of interest-bearing investments at the time the contract is issued. The annuitant does not benefit from a higher payment if interest rates rise over the duration of the contract. This is the reason annuities have interest rate risk. 3.5.1.2 Age of annuitant \u00b6 The age of the annuitant when payments begin is a significant contributor to the amount received as income from life annuities. The older the annuitant, the larger each payment will be since on average, fewer years remain for payments to be made. 3.5.1.3 Gender of annuitant \u00b6 Women receive a lower life annuity payment because, on average, they live longer than men. Therefore, to receive the same income as a male annuitant at the same age, a larger deposit is required. 3.5.1.4 Deposit amount \u00b6 Insurers want to attract large accounts. To do so, they may offer a higher annuity rate to those who have more to invest. 3.5.1.5 Payment schedule \u00b6 Slightly more is received when the length of time between payments is longer rather than shorter. This is because the insurer has the unpaid sums at its disposal to invest. Therefore, a single annuity payment received at the end of each year, for example, will be slightly more than 12 monthly payments. 3.5.1.6 Length of payment period \u00b6 When the policy owner buys the annuity contract, they commit to deposit a set amount of principal or capital to the insurer. The insurer then pays out that principal plus interest over the period represented by the type of annuity chosen: term or life. The longer the payment period is expected to be, the lower the amount of each payment. Example Rosario is 60 years old and healthy. He invests $100,000 in an annuity contract. Scenario 1 He purchases a 10-year term annuity. Assuming it is paid to maturity, it will yield 120 monthly payments (10 years \u00d7 12 months). Based only on 10 years of payments, Rosario could receive a monthly payment of $833 ( $100,000 \u00f7 120). Scenario 2 He purchases an immediate life annuity. The insurer\u2019s mortality tables indicate his expected lifespan is 24 years. The annuity is thus expected to yield 288 monthly payments (24 years \u00d7 12 months). Based only on 24 years of payments, Rosario could receive a monthly payment of $347 ( $100,000 \u00f7 288). 3.5.2 Guarantees \u00b6 Guarantees increase the cost of the annuity for the policy owner, decreasing the amount the annuitant receives. However, guarantees reduce the risk that the initial deposit will not be paid out in part or fully, and therefore, protects the invested capital. Term annuities do not require guarantees since, one way or another, the principal is paid out. In a joint and last survivor and life annuity, a guarantee is an option chosen by the policy owner. 3.5.2.1 Guarantee period and guaranteed capital \u00b6 A term annuity is guaranteed for its entire term. If the contract owner dies during the term, a beneficiary receives the difference between the sum invested and the amount paid to the annuitant. The three options available for a beneficiary are discussed in Section 3.2.3.1. A life annuity can be issued with or without a guarantee. The guarantee applies to a period of time stated as a number of years, such as 5, 10, or 20 years. This length of time referred to as the guarantee period. The guarantee ensures that if the annuitant dies before the end of the guarantee period, the beneficiary receives a payment from the contract. The amount the beneficiary receives represents the difference between the number of payments provided for the guarantee period and the number of payments the annuitant received: For example, Annette purchases a life annuity that is paid monthly with a 10-year guarantee period. She names her twin sister, Ava, as the beneficiary of the contract; The guarantee ensures that the annuity will issue a minimum of 120 payments (12 monthly payments per year \u00d7 10 years). If Annette dies after receiving 100 payments, her sister Ava will receive the equivalent of 20 payments (120 \u2013 100). The amount the beneficiary receives may be paid as: A lump sum, corresponding to the current value of future guaranteed payments; or Instalment payments for the remainder of the guaranteed period. This guarantee brings peace of mind to the policy owner because he knows that a sum of money from the annuity is guaranteed to be paid out - first to the annuitant himself and, if he dies, to the beneficiary. The guarantee period option does not apply to the total amount invested in the contract; rather It safeguards some of the investment. The type of guarantee that protects the total initial investment is called a capital protection guarantee. Available in life annuities, the capital protection guarantee returns a sum to the beneficiary equal to the difference between payments received before the death of the annuitant and the initial capital: The annuity is called a \u201ccash refund annuity\u201d if the beneficiary receives a lump sum; If the amount is paid in instalments, the annuity is called an \u201cinstalment refund annuity.\u201d A life annuity without a guarantee is a risky investment. The annuitant of a single life contract could die after receiving his first monthly payment. If no guarantee was in place, no payment would be made to a beneficiary. The balance of the sum invested with the insurer would then belong to the insurer. However, a life annuity without a guarantee also pays at a higher rate than when guarantees are added. The contract owner or annuitant(s) must weigh the higher return against the higher risk to decide which form of annuity is most suitable. 3.5.2.2 Guaranteed survivor income \u00b6 When a joint and last survivor annuity is chosen, survivor income is guaranteed for two lives. A guarantee period can also be added to the contract to provide the assurance that a certain amount will be paid out from the amount invested. Example Tony and Jane buy a $100,000 joint-and-last-survivor life annuity with a 10-year guarantee. Tony and Jane are co-annuitants. Jane is set to receive the full amount of the benefit upon Tony\u2019s death. Tony and Jane\u2019s son, Roger, is the beneficiary. Tony receives $300 per month as his annuity payment. Jane does not receive a payment. When Tony dies two years after receiving his first payment, payments are then issued to Jane. Jane receives $300 per month until she dies three years later. Payments were made to Tony and Jane for a total of five years. Roger receives a sum equivalent to 5 years\u2019 payments because the contract has a 10-year guarantee, i.e., $18,000: ( $300 \u00d7 12 months \u00d7 5 years). He chooses to receive the amount as a lump sum. Because annuity payments to a surviving annuitant extend the period of payment, joint annuities generate lower payments than a single life annuity, all other factors being equal. As an alternative to a joint and last survivor annuity, a spouse who is named as a beneficiary in a single life annuity contract with a guaranteed payment could receive income in the form of instalment payments. 3.5.2.3 Return of premium guarantee \u00b6 Some insurers offer a \u201creturn of premium guarantee\u201d as a rider to the contract. This guarantee pays the full deposit to the contract directly to the beneficiary if the annuitant dies before the first payment. 3.6 Limitations of Annuities \u00b6 Annuities have disadvantages that the potential policy-owner must weigh against their advantages to determine if an annuity is an appropriate investment choice. 3.6.1 Risks \u00b6 Annuities are insulated from many typical investment risks for the contract owner and annuitant when they are not issued in the variable income form. Once the contract is finalized, the investor knows how much to expect, through the promised annuity rate, and when, due to the timing and schedule selected in the application. No further decisions are required. The annuity is set with its Canadian issuer and for the most part, unchangeable. While being an advantage, this exposes the annuitant to interest rate and inflation risks. It also hampers flexibility to acquire funds for unforeseen expenses. 3.6.1.1 Interest rate risk \u00b6 Interest-rate risk is often associated with annuities, especially when interest rates are low at the time the contract is drawn up. If the policy owner commits to a low interest rate, that commitment cannot be changed. Instead, if rates rise, the annuity payment continues at the original rate. Interest-rate risk can be managed during a period of low interest rates by using investment capital to buy a series of annuities acquired over a number of years instead of buying a single annuity. If interest rates rise, the policy owner will benefit from the increased rates with higher payments. 3.6.1.2 Inflation risk \u00b6 Inflation risk goes hand-in-hand with interest rate risk. Inflation risk can be managed by acquiring an indexed annuity, even though the cost of the annuity is much higher than an annuity that is not indexed. This means that less is initially received in the annuity payment because the principal must be retained to increase payments in the future. 3.6.2 Loss of capital \u00b6 A life annuity contract without a guarantee period risks the loss of capital\u2014if the annuitant dies, the contract ends. If death occurred just after payments began, most capital deposited to the contract would be retained by the insurance company. This risk is managed by adding a guarantee period and beneficiary to the contract. Adding a guarantee period increases the cost of the annuity. Payments to the annuitant are less when a guarantee period exists. Example Nicholas, a widower with two grown children, receives an inheritance from his aunt in the amount of $450,000. He uses the money to buy an immediate single life annuity, but he does not elect to include a guarantee period. Therefore, a beneficiary is not named. One year after annuity payments start, Nicholas dies. Neither his children nor his estate can benefit from the remaining value of the annuity. If Nicholas had opted for a guarantee period that named his children as beneficiaries, they would have received the value of the guarantee. 3.6.3 Restrictions on withdrawal or surrender \u00b6 There is very little liquidity and flexibility with an annuity investment since there may be restrictions or penalties on withdrawing funds and surrendering the contract. It should be noted that payout and accumulation annuities are very different when it comes to withdrawals and surrender. 3.6.3.1 Withdrawals \u00b6 Payout annuities do not permit withdrawals. When a market withdrawal is made from an accumulation annuity: A market value adjustment (MVA) is a penalty calculated by the insurer that has issued the contract. The agent must inform the contract owner that a withdrawal may be reduced by the MVA. The MVA is based on interest rates, expenses, and the amount of time remaining until the maturity date of the investment. The interest rate factor looks at the guaranteed interest rate and the interest rate in effect at the time of withdrawal. Expenses are the costs incurred by the insurer. If an accumulation annuity is converted to a payout annuity, withdrawals will affect the amount paid out from the annuity. 3.6.3.2 Surrender \u00b6 A policy surrender terminates the policy. An annuity funded by the transfer of locked-in funds from a registered pension plan, a locked-in retirement account (LIRA), or a life income fund (LIF) cannot be surrendered. A term annuity may be surrendered for its commuted value, which means all future annuity payments are instead received in one lump sum. Surrender of a life annuity may be possible when annuity payments have not started. A portion of the investment capital deposited to the contract is returned to the policy owner. A contract cannot be surrendered after payments from a life annuity start. In contrast to a payout annuity, an accumulation annuity may be surrendered at any time and its cash value received by the policy owner. 3.7 Taxation of Annuities \u00b6 Annuity payments are made up of a blend of investment capital deposited to the contract by the policy owner, and interest earned on that capital. Payout annuities are taxed depending on how they were funded and whether they qualify as \u201cprescribed annuities.\u201d The growth in an accumulation annuity is taxed annually, if it is held in a non-registered account. The growth in an accumulation annuity is not taxed annually, if it is held in a registered account as taxation of growth is tax deferred until withdrawal. 3.7.1 Taxation of registered payments \u00b6 When an annuity is purchased with taxable registered funds, such as by transfers from an RRSP, the payment received by the annuitant is taxed as income in the year it is received. A deferred annuity purchased with registered funds is not taxed during the deferral period, as no income is received by the annuitant. Remember that with registered funds, the investor and the annuitant are one and the same. Withholding tax is applied to payments when annuities have been purchased with funds transferred from a registered pension plan, LIF, LIRA, or deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP). Withdrawals from a registered accumulation annuity are charged a withholding tax, except if the account is a registered retirement income fund (RRIF). Then, withholding tax only applies on amounts withdrawn above the annual minimum required amount. 3.7.2 Taxation of non-registered payments \u00b6 A withdrawal from a non-registered accumulated annuity must be reported for tax purposes. The interest portion of payments made from a payout annuity purchased with non-registered funds may be taxed as prescribed or accrual, also called \u201cnon-prescribed\u201d income. Accrual income is taxed annually in the hands of the annuitant. When an annuity is deferred later than December 31 of the year following the purchase date, it is taxed on an accrual basis. As soon as the income begins, the tax treatment switches to being prescribed only if the annuity qualifies. Whether an annuity is prescribed or taxed on an accrual basis, the amount of income tax paid over the full payment period is the same. The timing of the tax is the difference. 3.7.2.1 Prescribed annuity \u00b6 A prescribed annuity pays the same amount of interest and investment capital to the annuitant in every payment. Payments are thus said to be level. This is highly desired because the amount of interest to be declared for income tax does not change and tax obligations can be known and planned for. In the early years of the contract, less tax may be paid than would be paid for an accrual annuity. There are a number of requirements that must be satisfied for annuity income to be prescribed. They include: Annuity cannot be indexed; Annuitant and policy owner must be the same person unless the annuity is joint life, with a spouse or sibling named as co-annuitant; Payments must begin no later than December 31 of the year following the purchase date. 3.7.2.2 Accrual annuity \u00b6 An accrual annuity payment is comprised of more interest than investment capital in its early years. Consequently, accrual annuities have a larger amount of tax owing in the early years of payments, compared to prescribed annuities. However, tax declines over time as the portion of each payment that is interest declines and more investment capital is paid. Income tax on an accrual annuity is payable on interest earned in the year of purchase from the purchase date to the policy anniversary. Thereafter, income tax is payable on the interest received for the full year and reported on the income tax return for that year. Example Peter wishes to invest in an annuity to receive payments five years from now. Depending on the type of annuity purchased, payments will be taxed on an accrual or prescribed basis. Scenario 1 \u2013 Accrual annuity Peter buys a deferred life annuity. He is the annuitant of the contract. His first monthly payment is to be paid in five years. The annuity does not meet the conditions to be prescribed because it is deferred beyond December 31 st of that year. He is taxed on investment growth annually during the five years of deferral. Each of his payments is $800 when they begin, and is comprised of $100 in capital and $700 in interest. Therefore, of the $9,600 he receives for the year ( $800 \u00d7 12), he pays tax on $8,400 ( $700 \u00d7 12). After five years, each $800 payment is $400 in capital and $400 in interest. After ten years, the payment is $700 in capital and $100 in interest. Scenario 2 \u2013 Prescribed annuity Peter acquires an accumulation annuity contract. He is taxed on investment growth annually. Five years later, Peter decides to use the savings in his contract to transfer into an immediate life annuity in which he is the annuitant. Payments of $800 are to begin immediately. Since the life annuity meets all the necessary conditions, it is prescribed. The amount of tax he pays is level (i.e., it is equal throughout the payment period because each payment will be comprised of the same portion of capital and interest). If payments are comprised of $440 of capital and $360 of interest, on the $9,600 he will receive annually ( $800 \u00d7 12), he will pay taxes on $4,320 ( $360 \u00d7 12) for the duration of the payment period. 3.7.3 Tax on guarantees \u00b6 The tax on the payment of a guarantees to a beneficiary is not clear and guidance should be sought from the insurer issuing the guarantee payment. 3.7.4 Tax on surrender \u00b6 When a policy is surrendered, tax applies on investment growth in the contract unless registered funds are the source of contract deposit. When registered funds are the source of the contract deposit, 100% of the amount received from the surrender is taxed at the same rate as interest in the year it is received. The agent should always seek the advice of a tax specialist when surrender is planned to anticipate the tax consequences. 3.7.5 Tax benefits \u00b6 Annuity income may be eligible for the tax benefits of income splitting and the pension income tax credit. Income splitting allows 50% of the taxable income from a payout annuity to be transferred to a spouse. Tax savings can result when the spouse pays tax at a lower marginal tax rate than if all income is taxed in the hands of the first spouse. Tax rules which govern income attribution may limit the benefits of income splitting. The pension income tax credit is a federal tax credit. It is available to taxpayers with eligible pension income, such as the income paid by an annuity. The maximum credit is $2,000 annually and can reduce tax payable. The tax credit is available to annuitants\u2019 age 65 and older. Those younger than 65 can take advantage of the tax credit if they receive payments from an annuity in a registered account that was owned by a deceased spouse or common-law partner. 3.8 Annuity Classification \u00b6 An annuity must define: The lives covered by the contract: One (single) or two (joint); Timing of payments: Immediate or deferred; Type of funding: Registered or non-registered; Type of payment issued: Level or indexed (variable); Duration of payments: Term or life. 3.9 New types of annuities \u00b6 Two new types of annuities were introduced in 2019: the advanced life deferred annuity (ALDA) and the variable payment life annuity (VPLA). Both are, as their names suggest, a form of life annuity but they differ from the life annuities already discussed. Their primary objective is unlike that of other annuities in that they are intended to provide Canadians with greater flexibility in managing their retirement savings. These annuities are new to the Canadian market. It remains to be seen if they will interest consumers. New agents should be familiar with these names and their main features. 3.9.1 Advanced life deferred annuity (ALDA) \u00b6 An advanced deferred life annuity (ALDA) is a life annuity available to individuals who have an RRSP or a RRIF or who participate in a deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP), a pooled registered pension plan (PRPP) or a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP). More on these accounts and plans is provided later in this manual. Key to this form of annuity is the ability to defer payments until the end of the year in which the annuitant reaches 85. Therefore, the ALDA addresses longevity risk and ensures that investors do not deplete their savings prematurely during retirement. The funds deposited to an ALDA are no longer controlled by the account owner. This lessens the need for decisions about investments at a time of life when people may lose their ability to make complex financial choices. Payments are periodic, as with other annuities. The ALDA cannot be commuted or surrendered, or provide a guarantee. A lifetime limit of 25% of the value of the qualifying plan, to a total of $150,000 applies to ALDA purchases and will be indexed to inflation. Income received will not be included in calculating the minimum annual amount withdrawal from a RRIF, a PRPP account or a defined contribution account, after the year in which the ALDA is purchased. Example Noor has an RRSP valued at $400,000. She is unlikely to need access to the entire sum at retirement because she plans on working as a consultant into her late 70s. Noor also expects to live until she is in her 90s since her mother, father and grandmother have all lived to their late 90s. She converts 25% ( $400,000 x 25% = $100,000) of her RRSP to an ALDA to ensure that when she reaches 85 some additional funds are available to help her pay the costs she expects to incur to live independently in later life. 3.9.2 Variable payment life annuity (VPLA) \u00b6 A variable payment life annuity is an option for a PRPP contributor or members of a DCPP. Transfers to fund the VPLA are made directly from each type of plan if the plan administrator has established a VPLA arrangement. A minimum of 10 retired members is required to implement the annuity. The VPLA requires that periodic payments begin by the end of the year in which the member turns 71 or the end of the calendar year in which the VPLA is acquired. This form of annuity may be subject to provincial pension benefits standards legislation.","title":"Chapter 3 Annuities"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_3_Annuities/#chapter-3-annuities","text":"","title":"Chapter 3: Annuities"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_3_Annuities/#30-annuities","text":"Annuities are an investment product that takes the form of a contract which specifies terms of payment. Life insurance companies issue all forms of annuities. Banks and other financial institutions may only issue one form of annuity, known as a term annuity or \u201cterm certain\u201d annuity. Annuities are usually structured to pay a regular income to the person named as the annuitant in the contract, and this is typically their most important feature. The factors that influence how much the annuity pays to the annuitant are the quoted annuity rate, and guarantees on the annuity payment, if any. Annuities that pay an income are called \u201cpayout annuities.\u201d They are differentiated by whether the payout begins immediately (immediate annuities) or at a future date (deferred annuities). Payout annuities are purchased by the payment of a premium or deposit to the annuity contract by the contract\u2019s owner. The contract owner chooses a schedule for payments (also called the \u201cannuity benefit\u201d) and the duration for payments, either for life (a life annuity) or a period of time (a term annuity). Once annuity payments begin, they generally cannot be stopped before the end of the payment period. Most payout annuities are issued with a set, or level, payment unless the annuity is either an indexed annuity or a variable annuity. In addition to payout annuities, Canadians can also buy accumulation annuities. An accumulation annuity does not pay income, but provides a way to accumulate funds in the form of savings with a maturity date. At maturity, the savings in the annuity may be converted into a payout annuity or surrendered (paid to the owner) without penalty. Accumulation annuities provide investment security because 100% of the invested capital is returned to the investor. In addition to the security they provide, annuities are easily understood, provide income security, creditor protection, and estate planning benefits and protection for the annuitant in the form of insurance against the issuer\u2019s insolvency or bankruptcy through Assuris.","title":"3.0 Annuities"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_3_Annuities/#31-advantages-of-annuities","text":"The following advantages of annuities are explained in more detail in this section: Straightforward investment concept; Income security that can be adapted to the client\u2019s needs and situation; Creditor protection; Estate planning benefits; Annuitant protection (Assuris coverage).","title":"3.1 Advantages of Annuities"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_3_Annuities/#311-straightforward-investment-concept","text":"Payout annuities are the most common form of annuity and are what most people think of when they think of an annuity. The process of acquiring a payout annuity sees the following (note: there are many nuances available to customize payout annuities to individual needs): An individual wants to receive a regular payment from a lump sum of capital to invest. He wants to invest his capital without risk of loss, and, typically, looks to the annuity payments as a source of regular income, since his investment is repaid to him over time. The investor decides who is going to receive the payment from the contract. This person is called the annuitant. The insurer pays the annuitant on a regular schedule, that has been selected by the contract owner. Each payment is comprised of a portion of the invested capital plus interest. The starting point for payments to the annuitant to begin depends on whether the annuity is immediate or deferred. Once started, payments continue for life or the term of the contract: Life annuity: ends on death of the annuitant; Term annuity: ends on its maturity date. An accumulation annuity \u201cbreaks the annuity mold\u201d because it does not pay an income. It is a form of term savings with a maturity date.

This is one reason why many investors choose annuities for retirement income. Level payments are also a way the owner can control the amount of income to be paid to an annuitant when the annuitant is unable to manage his or her personal finances on their own. For instance, a parent could establish an annuity for a mentally challenged child with the assurance that the child would receive a regular payment of a known sum.

When an annuity names specific beneficiaries, rather than the owner\u2019s estate, the amount deposited to the annuity contract is protected against financial claims made by creditors of the contract owner. The intention of the law, providing that annuity deposits cannot be accessed by creditors, is to protect the dependants of an insolvent contract owner from creditor claims. The value of the contract cannot be claimed by creditors when a spouse, child, grandchild, or parent is named as the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the annuity contract, or when an irrevocable beneficiary is named. Some annuities offer unseizable benefits, such as annuities funded by a transfer of a lock-in pension, coming from a locked-in retirement account (LIRA). However, if a contract owner surrenders their term annuity and receives its commuted value (as a lump sum), that lump sum does not benefit from creditor protection.

Its purpose is to protect estate capital. The insured annuity process is: A proposed policy owner identifies the sum of money needed on death to settle their estate; They acquire permanent life insurance, such as Term-100 (T-100) or whole life insurance, with a death benefit that is equal to the sum required to settle their estate; If the proposed policy owner does not qualify for life insurance, the insured annuity cannot be implemented, and the process must stop at this point. After the insurance policy is issued, the life insured buys a life annuity with a deposit that is sufficient to ensure that the annuity payments will, at a minimum, cover the life insurance premiums as they come due; Upon the death of the life insured (who is also the annuitant), the life annuity contract and payments end, and the life insurance death benefit is paid to beneficiaries and/or the estate. Beneficiaries do not receive the capital of the estate through the will, but because the insured annuity \u201cmatches\u201d the needs of the estate to the life insurance death benefit, they will receive an equivalent amount of capital from the life insurance policy death benefit, tax-free. Example Stephen, aged 60, wants to leave his two nieces a legacy of $250,000 each on his death. If he puts aside the $500,000 now, he no longer can spend that money. Instead, Stephen purchases a Term-100 life insurance policy with a $500,000 death benefit. He names his nieces as beneficiaries of the policy. Premiums for the policy are $1,000/month. Stephen then acquires a single life annuity using $200,000 of his savings. He receives about $1,000/month in an annuity payment. He uses the money to pay his life insurance premium. He has effectively \u201cbought\u201d an inheritance of $500,000 for the sum of $200,000.

For example, if a promised benefit is a level $1,000 per month, the annuitant will continue to receive $1,000 per month after the policy has been transferred to a new insurer.

The accumulation annuity credits interest of deposits on a daily, monthly, or compound basis. Daily interest is not a guaranteed sum. In certain cases, interest may be guaranteed over a number of years, such as one year, five years or ten years, because the annuity deposit is used to buy a fixed-term investment at a guaranteed interest rate.

He receives approximately $1,700 per month in his annuity payment. If the annuity were a 10-year term, he would receive about $900 per month. When a term annuity ends, all payments cease because the annuitant has received the entire principal deposited to the contract, along with the interest earned on that principal. If death of the annuitant occurs during the term of the annuity, the balance of annuity payments is paid to a beneficiary as either: Monthly payments for the period remaining in the term where the value is paid in instalments to the beneficiary and is sometimes called the instalment refund choice; A lump sum payment that represents the present value of all future payments paid as a cash refund. This is also known as the commuted value of the annuity or the cash refund choice; or The amount that remains of the original deposit.

The guarantee applies to a period of time stated as a number of years, such as 5, 10, or 20 years. This length of time referred to as the guarantee period. The guarantee ensures that if the annuitant dies before the end of the guarantee period, the beneficiary receives a payment from the contract. The amount the beneficiary receives represents the difference between the number of payments provided for the guarantee period and the number of payments the annuitant received: For example, Annette purchases a life annuity that is paid monthly with a 10-year guarantee period. She names her twin sister, Ava, as the beneficiary of the contract; The guarantee ensures that the annuity will issue a minimum of 120 payments (12 monthly payments per year \u00d7 10 years). If Annette dies after receiving 100 payments, her sister Ava will receive the equivalent of 20 payments (120 \u2013 100). The amount the beneficiary receives may be paid as: A lump sum, corresponding to the current value of future guaranteed payments; or Instalment payments for the remainder of the guaranteed period. This guarantee brings peace of mind to the policy owner because he knows that a sum of money from the annuity is guaranteed to be paid out - first to the annuitant himself and, if he dies, to the beneficiary. The guarantee period option does not apply to the total amount invested in the contract; rather It safeguards some of the investment. The type of guarantee that protects the total initial investment is called a capital protection guarantee. Available in life annuities, the capital protection guarantee returns a sum to the beneficiary equal to the difference between payments received before the death of the annuitant and the initial capital: The annuity is called a \u201ccash refund annuity\u201d if the beneficiary receives a lump sum; If the amount is paid in instalments, the annuity is called an \u201cinstalment refund annuity.\u201d A life annuity without a guarantee is a risky investment. The annuitant of a single life contract could die after receiving his first monthly payment. If no guarantee was in place, no payment would be made to a beneficiary. The balance of the sum invested with the insurer would then belong to the insurer. However, a life annuity without a guarantee also pays at a higher rate than when guarantees are added.

Withholding tax is applied to payments when annuities have been purchased with funds transferred from a registered pension plan, LIF, LIRA, or deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP).

Consequently, accrual annuities have a larger amount of tax owing in the early years of payments, compared to prescribed annuities. However, tax declines over time as the portion of each payment that is interest declines and more investment capital is paid. Income tax on an accrual annuity is payable on interest earned in the year of purchase from the purchase date to the policy anniversary. Thereafter, income tax is payable on the interest received for the full year and reported on the income tax return for that year. Example Peter wishes to invest in an annuity to receive payments five years from now. Depending on the type of annuity purchased, payments will be taxed on an accrual or prescribed basis. Scenario 1 \u2013 Accrual annuity Peter buys a deferred life annuity. He is the annuitant of the contract. His first monthly payment is to be paid in five years. The annuity does not meet the conditions to be prescribed because it is deferred beyond December 31 st of that year. He is taxed on investment growth annually during the five years of deferral. Each of his payments is $800 when they begin, and is comprised of $100 in capital and $700 in interest. Therefore, of the $9,600 he receives for the year ( $800 \u00d7 12), he pays tax on $8,400 ( $700 \u00d7 12). After five years, each $800 payment is $400 in capital and $400 in interest. After ten years, the payment is $700 in capital and $100 in interest. Scenario 2 \u2013 Prescribed annuity Peter acquires an accumulation annuity contract. He is taxed on investment growth annually. Five years later, Peter decides to use the savings in his contract to transfer into an immediate life annuity in which he is the annuitant. Payments of $800 are to begin immediately. Since the life annuity meets all the necessary conditions, it is prescribed. The amount of tax he pays is level (i.e., it is equal throughout the payment period because each payment will be comprised of the same portion of capital and interest). If payments are comprised of $440 of capital and $360 of interest, on the $9,600 he will receive annually ( $800 \u00d7 12), he will pay taxes on $4,320 ( $360 \u00d7 12) for the duration of the payment period.","title":"3.7.2.2 Accrual annuity"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_3_Annuities/#373-tax-on-guarantees","text":"The tax on the payment of a guarantees to a beneficiary is not clear and guidance should be sought from the insurer issuing the guarantee payment.","title":"3.7.3 Tax on guarantees"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_3_Annuities/#374-tax-on-surrender","text":"When a policy is surrendered, tax applies on investment growth in the contract unless registered funds are the source of contract deposit.

More on these accounts and plans is provided later in this manual. Key to this form of annuity is the ability to defer payments until the end of the year in which the annuitant reaches 85. Therefore, the ALDA addresses longevity risk and ensures that investors do not deplete their savings prematurely during retirement. The funds deposited to an ALDA are no longer controlled by the account owner. This lessens the need for decisions about investments at a time of life when people may lose their ability to make complex financial choices. Payments are periodic, as with other annuities. The ALDA cannot be commuted or surrendered, or provide a guarantee. A lifetime limit of 25% of the value of the qualifying plan, to a total of $150,000 applies to ALDA purchases and will be indexed to inflation. Income received will not be included in calculating the minimum annual amount withdrawal from a RRIF, a PRPP account or a defined contribution account, after the year in which the ALDA is purchased. Example Noor has an RRSP valued at $400,000. She is unlikely to need access to the entire sum at retirement because she plans on working as a consultant into her late 70s. Noor also expects to live until she is in her 90s since her mother, father and grandmother have all lived to their late 90s. She converts 25% ( $400,000 x 25% = $100,000) of her RRSP to an ALDA to ensure that when she reaches 85 some additional funds are available to help her pay the costs she expects to incur to live independently in later life.","title":"3.9.1 Advanced life deferred annuity (ALDA)"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_3_Annuities/#392-variable-payment-life-annuity-vpla","text":"A variable payment life annuity is an option for a PRPP contributor or members of a DCPP.

The investor profile is a collection of data about the client\u2019s financial situation and personal factors; The data is analyzed so the agent can better understand the client\u2019s motivations and preferences\u2014and what might influence his investment decisions. To create the investor profile, the agent must review: The assets and liabilities of the client to determine his overall financial situation; Personal factors that may affect the client\u2019s investment decisions; Client needs and objectives; Sources of income during retirement; Programs and savings plans that can help the client to save and meet his needs. 4.1 Financial Situation of the Investor \u00b6 Information about assets and liabilities is first gathered so the client\u2019s financial position may be evaluated through a net worth statement and a cash flow statement: The net worth statement lists assets and subtracts liabilities. It is a snapshot of the investor\u2019s financial situation and its result shows whether the investor has a positive net worth (good) or a negative net worth (bad); The cash flow statement lists income (inflow) and expenses (outflow). The bottom line reveals whether the investor earned more than he spent. A positive cash flow indicates that money is available for spending, saving and investing. A negative cash flow means that more is being spent than being earned; an unsustainable financial position. 4.1.1 Review of assets \u00b6 Assets are anything a person owns with cash value. The single most valuable asset most people own is their home thanks to the equity that builds over time as a result of the difference between the market value of the home and its decreasing mortgage. Personal assets also include other types of real estate, registered and non-registered investments, pension plan savings, the cash value of life insurance, fine jewelry, art and specialized equipment such as tools or cameras. Assets are important for both their value and the collateral they provide for the purpose of borrowing. Personal assets are listed to see the \u201cplus\u201d side of the net worth statement (also called a balance sheet). Their value shows the complete value of personal assets as well as progress made in building worth. The following are some of the documents that provide information about an investor\u2019s personal assets. 4.1.1.1 Income tax return \u00b6 Income is reported on the annual income tax return. Corporations file separate returns. After the income tax return is filed, the Notice of Assessment (NOA) is issued by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). Taxpayers in Qu\u00e9bec receive a NOA from Revenu Qu\u00e9bec. The key information shown in the personal income tax return is: Amount of taxable income; How that income is earned; Use of tax credits and deductions, including RRSP contributions. The NOA summarizes: Total income; Amount of tax paid; Amount of tax owed; Tax credits received; Deduction room available for an RRSP; Unused net capital losses; Tax-free savings account (TFSA) contributions, withdrawals, and unused contribution room; Other necessary repayments, carry-forwards, and rebate information. Income can be earned from multiple sources in addition to employment. For example, from a personal business, retirement pensions, investments, or spousal support. Dependability of the income is essential to planning. For example, business income could vary year-to-year, but income from a Canada Pension Plan (CPP)/Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP) retirement pension would be stable. From this information, the investor and agent know what can be counted on for income in future years. Contributions made to registered savings plans demonstrate the investor\u2019s current dedication to savings. The deduction limit for RRSPs is calculated based on earned income. It shows whether contributions are currently maximized and is a basis for planning future savings. Tax credits and other deductions reduce income tax: Charitable giving is reflected in the charitable donation credit; The pension income tax credit can demonstrate whether a strategy for splitting retirement income could be implemented since the tax credit must be claimed before income splitting can occur. The taxpayer generally pays tax at his marginal tax rate (MTR), which combines federal and provincial tax rates. The MTR is the rate of income tax applied to the next dollar of income earned. It is important to consider the MTR when choosing investments and planning on using investment income due to its effect on the net amount available for retirement. 4.1.1.2 Registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) statement \u00b6 The financial institution holding an RRSP issues regular statements; these statements show an account summary. An RRSP statement can show many details including: The sum invested; Growth of the sum invested; How the sum is invested; Whether the account holds locked-in funds; and Withdrawals. There is no limit to the number of RRSP accounts a person may have. Therefore, an individual may have multiple RRSP statements. However, annual contributions to all accounts, including a person\u2019s own RRSP and a spousal RRSP, are limited to the annual maximum, plus the available deduction limit, which includes the carry-forward of unused deductions from former years. An over-contribution of $2,000 over and above this amount is allowed before penalties are incurred. It is very important for an agent to see how the money deposited to the RRSP is invested. This could reveal: Investing expertise and knowledge; The investor\u2019s exposure to risk: Portfolio diversification; and Maturity dates. An account with locked-in funds restricts transfers and withdrawals. The money is locked-in because it has been transferred from a registered pension plan (RPP) or another locked-in account. Locked-in accounts will be addressed later in this chapter. Withdrawals from an RRSP may demonstrate that the investor has had an exceptional expense or has a need to supplement his income. A conversion of the account to a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) or annuity may be advisable if withdrawals seem to occur on a regular basis. The absence of an RRSP statement can also be revealing. It may show the investor does not understand the significance of having an RRSP or does not have funds available for saving in an RRSP. If the RRSP has been closed because the investor has surpassed the age limit for owning an RRSP, statements from other types of registered accounts may be available. An agent uses the RRSP statement to discern the value of this asset in the overall assets of the investor. 4.1.1.3 Non-registered investment account statements \u00b6 Just like an RRSP statement, a statement from a non-registered or taxable account will summarize the key aspects of this investment account. Unlike an RRSP, there are no limitations imposed by the Income Tax Act on either deposits or withdrawals to the account. This statement presents further detail regarding how the investor tends to invest as well as how much is available to contribute to net worth. 4.1.1.4 Pension plan statements \u00b6 A pension plan statement\u2014also called a member\u2019s benefit statement\u2014is issued on a yearly basis by employers who have a registered pension plan for their employees. An employer\u2019s pension can provide a dependable source of retirement income. This makes it a valuable asset. The statement may include the expected value of the pension to be received at the standard age of retirement. Other information can include contributions made during the year and the expected retirement date. This information is essential to knowing how much will be paid and when. Contributions made to a registered pension plan by an individual as well as calculated pension adjustments (PAs), reduce his RRSP deduction limit. 4.1.1.5 Bank statements \u00b6 Bank savings are sometimes used as an investment. It is essential to review bank statements to determine how much is available to contribute to total assets. 4.1.1.6 Life insurance policies \u00b6 Life insurance policies with a cash value are an asset since this value can be accessed by the policy owner. This includes whole life insurance and universal life insurance. The cash may be received as a: Cash surrender value; or Policy loan. Withdrawals may also be permitted by universal life insurance policies. 4.1.1.7 Other asset sources \u00b6 Multiple assets have worth or contribute to overall worth. For example: A business owner has asset value in his business in proportion to his share of ownership; An inventor or designer may have an asset in a patent or intellectual property and receive royalty income; A real estate investor may have income properties with asset value and receive rental income. The financial review should encompass all assets. 4.1.2 Review of liabilities \u00b6 Liabilities, unlike assets, reduce personal worth. Liabilities are debt and financial obligations that must be repaid. Sometimes a distinction is made between \u201cgood\u201d debt and \u201cbad\u201d debt. In both cases, the debt must be repaid by the borrower and included in the review of liabilities: Good debt is borrowing taken on to increase assets (i.e., a loan used for investment purposes or, in some cases, a mortgage); Bad debt is debt that reduces income and financial resources (i.e., credit card debt). The following documents provide information regarding the personal liabilities of an investor. 4.1.2.1 Mortgage statement \u00b6 An individual\u2019s mortgage is likely to be his largest liability\u2014just like his home is his biggest asset. Every year, the financial institution that holds the mortgage on the property issues a mortgage statement to the borrower. The mortgage statement largely presents: The amount owed; The principal and interest charge of each mortgage payment; The interest rate applied to the mortgage; The mortgage term and its amortization. A mortgage statement can also show a reverse mortgage is in place. A reverse mortgage is a payment of a portion of home equity to the homeowner in a lump sum or a series of payments. It is a liability that must be repaid if the owner sells the house or dies. 4.1.2.2 Line of credit statement \u00b6 An individual may receive a line of credit based on his creditworthiness and collateral. A line of credit may be extended to homeowners based on their equity in their home. This is called a \u201cHome Equity Line of Credit\u201d (HELOC). The line of credit statement shows: The amount owed; The minimum monthly payment required; and The interest rate charged against the amount of loan extended. 4.1.2.3 Credit card statements \u00b6 Credit card statements are issued monthly. The credit card statement shows: Charges incurred during the month; A separate charge for interest and cash advances; Balance of the account; The rate of interest charged; and The minimum monthly payment. 4.1.3 Financial position of client \u00b6 Assets and liabilities are compiled to form a financial profile in the net worth statement. Income and expenses appear in the cash flow statement and are added to the profile. The result shows the possible amount available for investing. 4.1.3.1 Net worth statement \u00b6 A net worth statement is developed by listing all assets at their market value and subtracting all liabilities. The final sum is the net worth of the individual or couple whose assets and liabilities are listed. Net worth = value of all assets - value of all liabilities A common goal of financial planning is to increase net worth to meet financial goals. Net worth is increased by: Acquiring more assets; Increasing the value of existing assets (for instance, through a home renovation); and Decreasing liabilities. A net worth statement is a benchmark against which goals can be fixed and future increases in worth can be measured. Example Net Worth Statement for John and Jane H., as of (date) 4.1.3.2 Cash flow statement \u00b6 The cash flow statement can be prepared for a period from a month to a year. The cash flow statement is most precise when it is supported by a budget based on actual spending patterns. The cash flow statement presents the rate at which assets are being accumulated or used. The cash flow statement shows all sources of net income (income after income tax) and subtracts all expenses (including debt payment for liabilities and potential child and spousal support): If a positive number results, money is available for spending, saving, or investing; If a negative number results, a debt management solution may be necessary, savings may have to be used, or assets may need to be sold to pay down debt. Example Cash flow statement for John and Jane H., as of (date) - * Car payments are finished; cash flow increases. - ** Entertainment increases due to family holiday; miscellaneous costs are less for the month. 4.2 Personal Factors that Affect Investment \u00b6 Many personal factors and preferences motivate investing decisions. They include the following. 4.2.1 Personal values \u00b6 Personal values influence an individual\u2019s investing approach as well as investment choices. For example, some people may value saving for education over saving for retirement. Others may value charitable giving over enlarging investment portfolios. The agent must learn if the values will affect his client\u2019s decisions to develop suitable recommendations. 4.2.2 Health concerns \u00b6 Health care costs can become significant with age and diminish the value of an estate. Therefore, health care costs introduce the risk of outliving one\u2019s money. Financial planning should take into consideration the potential need for financial resources later on to pay future health care expenses. The financial plan should take these expenses into account well before the money may be needed. This ensures sufficient savings are set aside for care in later years. The need to pay for care also introduces the potential need for long-term care insurance and critical illness insurance. The agent should take into account his client\u2019s mental capacity to make sound investment decisions. This is important because the client\u2019s mental capacity can be impaired due to disability or getting older. Particularly, when the client gets older and important decisions regarding the client\u2019s estate and retirement income must be made, the agent must potentially be prepared to guide decision-making based on the knowledge he has developed of the client. He must also be alert to signs that decisions being made are inappropriate. The risk of disability should be examined along with other health concerns. This risk is best managed by ensuring that disability income insurance is in place for the income earners of the family: Disability can have a harmful and lasting effect on income and wealth accumulation. Other health considerations that may affect the investor profile are the need: To save to provide an income for a disabled child; and To use financial resources to pay for care for aging parents. 4.2.3 Legal considerations \u00b6 The investor profile must take into account legal obligations to others that have a financial impact. 4.2.3.1 Family law \u00b6 A person in a married or common-law relationship has a financial responsibility to his spouse, whether the same or opposite sex when they separate and divorce. Note: that Qu\u00e9bec is an exception for common-law relationships. Family law attempts to equalize the assets of both parties in these circumstances, including investment property. Consequently, both spouses have rights in regard to investments and their proceeds. A parent also has financial duties to children, from both past marriage(s) and one\u2019s current marriage. Child or spousal support must be paid and its cost factored into financial obligations. 4.2.3.2 Will \u00b6 Developing the investor profile calls for a review of the will to see what commitments are planned for the value of the estate. Bequests in the will must be supported by the necessary financial resources or they may remain unfulfilled. In general, a surviving spouse can obtain all the assets of a deceased spouse on a rollover basis, meaning that any taxes are deferred until the death of the second spouse. Careful planning is required to meet bequests made in the will. If investment proceeds are set out for a particular purpose, then the giftor should ensure an adequate amount of money will be available for the property\u2019s inheritor. These cases may require investments with guarantees (i.e., segregated funds or a life annuity with a beneficiary) so the giftor is assured his wishes are carried out. Life insurance is essential for fulfilling estate plans. 4.2.3.3 Power of attorney (POA) for property \u00b6 The power of attorney (POA) is essentially a document that nominates a person to act on behalf of another when specified circumstances arise. It often accompanies a will but is invoked when the individual who has created the POA is unable to act for himself. This often arises due to medical issues. Powers of attorney differ from province to province. When developing the background knowledge for the investor profile, the agent should include whether a power of attorney has been given, to whom, and what his powers are, in order to determine in what circumstances he should be consulted. A POA may be issued to address end-of-life health decisions or property issues. The attorney in a POA is the individual named to assume decision making for another. It is not necessarily a lawyer although a lawyer could be named as attorney in a POA. It is often an individual known and trusted by the person making the POA (called the grantor). An agent should decline being named as an attorney and must exercise caution when confronted with dealing with an attorney for property. The attorney has many powers for dealing with the individual\u2019s property including switching and selling investments. Agents should be aware of the limitations on the attorney\u2019s powers, including a restriction on changing life insurance beneficiaries, except in B.C. Financial exploitation by attorneys is a major problem; POA fraud is a criminal offence. 4.2.4 Personal risks \u00b6 Each investor faces personal risks that can affect plans for savings and investing such as the following. 4.2.4.1 Low level of financial literacy \u00b6 Financial literacy is the ability to understand the fundamental matters of personal finance. Individuals differ greatly regarding their level of financial illiteracy. The agent should never make assumptions based on what a client appears to know or ought to know. Financial illiteracy (i.e., a lack of knowledge and understanding about financial products) can lead to an unnecessarily low tolerance of risk, which in turn can lead to low returns on investments or unnecessarily high risk tolerance, which leads to investment losses. The agent should assess his client\u2019s financial literacy and explain to his client any necessary information regarding investments, proposed plans, and the effect of risk tolerance. Information must be properly communicated to the client, both in writing and verbally: In some cases, when the client\u2019s language skills are limited, the agent will have to call on an interpreter to communicate with the client in the client\u2019s language; The agent should avoid the use of acronyms and jargon (i.e., use the term \u201cmarginal tax rate\u201d opposed to \u201cMTR\u201d); Financial institutions, insurers, and financial regulators provide educational resources that can be useful to help improve the client\u2019s financial literacy. 4.2.4.2 Risk of job loss \u00b6 Job loss can have a harmful effect on investment and savings plans. An emergency fund (i.e., savings to cover living expenses for a minimum of three months and up to six months) could help reduce the impacts of job loss. If job loss occurs, the investor profile should be reviewed right away. Plans may need to be put on hold before irreversible changes are made that relied on continued employment. 4.2.4.3 Longevity risk \u00b6 People are currently living longer in Canada than ever before. Despite the increase in life expectancy for both men and women, the age of retirement currently remains at 65. Note that the retirement age is stated to gradually change, over a year period, to 67 years in 2023. Therefore, this means retirement savings must last longer. Longevity risk is the risk that a person continues to live past the point in time that savings are depleted. This is called outliving your money. Longevity risk can be managed by insurance, specifically, investments that provide lifelong income, such as a life annuity or a Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit. 4.2.4.4 Risk of bankruptcy \u00b6 Bankruptcy occurs when an individual or a company is unable to meet financial obligations to creditors. Risk of bankruptcy is mitigated by: Financial management; and For individuals, choosing a careful selection of investments that can provide creditor protection (such as segregated funds). 4.2.4.5 Risk of leveraging \u00b6 Leveraging is when an individual uses borrowed money to attain a financial goal. Some forms of leveraging are common and are considered safe such as acquiring a mortgage to purchase a home and develop the equity in the home. Some forms of leveraging are considered riskier such as using a loan to invest in non-guaranteed investments. If the investment loses value, the investor has lost principal plus he owes the amount of the loan invested. Therefore, leveraging can either: Boost returns since it gives the investor a greater sum to invest; or Amplify losses since the investor loses his savings plus the borrowed sum. The client\u2019s knowledge of leveraging is essential to the investor profile since it speaks to investor goals and risk tolerance. 4.2.4.6 Risk of unforeseen expenses \u00b6 Unforeseen expenses are exactly what their name suggests: expenses that arise unexpectedly and, therefore, cannot be planned for. Medical expenses are one category of expense often overlooked due to the assumption that provincial health plans cover all bills. In fact, many health care costs are not paid by provincial insurance. Investors should ensure they have an emergency fund to cover these expenses and should take immediate action if a large unforeseen expense arises that disrupts their savings income and needs. 4.3 Investor Needs \u00b6 The investor\u2019s needs are essential to develop the investor profile because needs override wants. Needs represent the reasons behind the investor\u2019s motivation for exploring investment options as well as making investment decisions. The agent\u2019s role is to recognize and understand the needs that affect plans and decision-making. These include the following. 4.3.1 Need for income \u00b6 Income is a necessity to pay the costs of living and for saving. Goals must be realistic and identified with an assigned dollar value to give meaning and purpose to savings plans. If there is not enough income, or only just enough, to pay for the costs of living, then any plans for savings must wait until there is an increase in income or a decrease in costs. 4.3.1.1 Individual or household income needs \u00b6 There are three groupings of individuals in which there will be a need to examine the income needs of an individual: Those who are unmarried and not in a common-law relationship; The widowed; Those who are separated or divorced. To create an accurate picture of an individual\u2019s financial situation, individual income needs must be compared against individual expenses. The shared financial situation of couples should be assessed according to the household or family income \u2014 this encompasses both income earners and household expenses. For both individuals and couples, the income needs of dependants should be taken into consideration. Income needs may be expressed in terms of present and future needs. For instance, if an investor profile needs an increased income in the present, the agent may want to reassess the individual\u2019s budget to detect spending behaviour. The investment plan\u2019s focus should concentrate on meeting future income needs. Such a plan is based on goals for the future. 4.3.2 Need for retirement income \u00b6 Retirement income is the money needed to meet retirement expenses. Retirement income replaces or supplements employment income when a person retires. Income sources during retirement can include: Government retirement pension income; Private pension income; Investment income; Personal savings; Employment income since some choose to continue work post-retirement; Business income. The business owner may not be actively working in the company but still receive a salary or dividends. An essential factor when assessing the amount of income needed during retirement is the income tax that will be due on amounts received. Therefore, spending should be based on net income (i.e., income remaining after tax). 4.3.2.1 Income splitting \u00b6 Income splitting takes advantage of the different marginal tax rates of spouses. When spouses have the same marginal tax rate, income splitting serves no purpose. Income splitting apportions income between spouses so that some income is moved to a spouse who pays tax at a lower marginal tax rate than the other. Therefore, the couple saves money putting income into the hands of a spouse who pays tax at a lower rate. Some examples of effective income splitting include: Opening a spousal or common-law partner RRSP: The higher-income spouse makes payments to the plan for the other spouse. This works for income splitting if the spouse receiving the contributions is in a lower tax bracket than the contributing spouse when withdrawals are made. This is referred to as a spousal or common-law partner plan. Splitting pension income for those 65 and older: Up to 50% of the annual income received from a lifetime annuity, registered pension plan, RRSP annuity, registered retirement income fund (RRIF) or deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP) annuity can be allocated to a spouse. The splitting for tax (SPSP) purposes is done via the tax return. Assigning Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits: CPP can be shared between spouses who were contributors, or between spouses when only one was a contributor. This is called an assignment. Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP) sharing is also available for couples who are married or in a civil union or living in a common-law relationship of at least three years\u2019 duration. Example David receives $18,690 per year as a pension from his former employer. His marginal tax rate is 37%. He could pay as much as $6,915.30 ( $18,690 \u00d7 37%) in income tax on his pension. David\u2019s wife, Beth, has a marginal tax rate of 29%. David splits his pension with Beth, so they each declare $9,345 ( $18,690 \u00f7 2) as income. David\u2019s income tax payable becomes $3,457.65 ( $9,345 \u00d7 37%). Beth\u2019s income tax payable is $2,710.05 ( $9,345 \u00d7 29%). Together they pay $6,167.70 in income tax ( $3,457.65 + $2,710.05), a saving of $747.60 ( $6,915.30 \u2013 $6,167.70) compared to the tax due if David did not split his pension income. There can be an added advantage for the retiree who receives Old Age Security (OAS) pension benefits when income splitting. The OAS pension is completely forfeited by the pensioner when net income reaches a specified level and partly repaid when income exceeds a threshold level. Therefore, the amount of repayment, also called the \u201cclawback,\u201d is reduced when income is reduced by income splitting. 4.3.3 Need for tax efficiency \u00b6 Using tax credits is another way to reduce income tax. Federal and provincial/territorial tax credits are available. Some tax credits are non-refundable. They can reduce income tax, but if the total credits surpass federal tax, a refund is not issued for the balance. It is important for the taxpayer to use all tax credits to which he is entitled to ease the burden of taxes. 4.3.4 Need for emergency fund \u00b6 An emergency fund is a readily available sum generally equivalent to a minimum of three months\u2019 living expenses. It is to be used strictly for payment of unexpected expenses or to replace income that is suddenly lost. The review of assets shows whether an emergency fund has been created. If not, the agent can assist the investor to create an emergency fund with a high degree of liquidity to be available as needed. 4.3.5 Need for creditor proofing \u00b6 A creditor is a person or company that is owed money by another. The amount owed is the creditor\u2019s credit to the debtor (i.e., borrower). A creditor has rights and recourses to attain the repayment of the amount owed. An asset is creditor proofed when a creditor cannot legally obtain the debtor\u2019s asset or its value for repayment. Creditor-proofing should not be a standalone exercise or be the sole motivation for investment choice. An investment should first be chosen based on how it meets the full scope of client needs. If creditor-proofing is available, it should be considered as coincidental\u2014merely as one feature of an investment product. The investments may be seized if it appears in bankruptcy proceedings that the investments were chosen primarily to defeat creditors. An investment must be chosen for the contribution it makes to net worth\u2014not to escape monetary obligations. 4.3.6 Need for liquidity \u00b6 Liquidity refers to how easily a person or company can retrieve cash\u2014this includes converting assets into cash. Liquidity in some assets is essential to help a person in the event of a disaster or personal hardship. For example, if a person found himself in grave medical condition while travelling without the benefit of travel medical insurance, he would need access to cash immediately to pay for required medical care. An assessment of assets will show if there is liquidity in the investor\u2019s portfolio. 4.3.7 Need for estate planning \u00b6 The net worth statement determines if assets are available to create an inheritance for children, family or friends, or for a charity. The cash flow statement shows the rate at which assets are being accumulated or used. Individuals who wish to leave an inheritance when they die must make plans in advance regarding their estate to ensure that bequests can be filled according to their wishes. 4.3.7.1 Charitable giving \u00b6 An interest in charitable giving is sparked by a person who gives to others and puts a precedence on needs outside his individual interests. Charitable giving is associated with estate planning\u2014a person who wants to donate to charity after their death. This is often done by people who have donated to charity during their lives and hope to continue to do so following their death. A person who wants to donate to charity following his death will want to ensure that the sum he has planned to give will be available. A taxpayer can receive the corresponding tax credit when he deducts up to 75% of his net income as a donation. In the year of death or year before death, up to 100% of net income can be claimed as a donation. 4.3.8 Need for diversification \u00b6 An assessment of financial documents and investment statements may show a concentration of money in a particular account or investment. Note that a lack of diversification increases the likelihood of risk and potential losses. For example, an investor who only invests in Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) runs inflation risk, since returns of GICs can be lower than the increase in the cost of living. If the investor does not diversify into an investment that pays a higher return, he will experience a loss in his purchasing power over time. 4.3.9 Need for investment management \u00b6 A review of the investor\u2019s assets and knowledge may show that the investor runs risks that would have been otherwise avoidable due to the choices he has made in the past. This unnecessary risk could be due to the investor\u2019s: Previous investing decisions (which may not have been properly invested for his age, risk tolerance, or goals); and Financial illiteracy (i.e., failing to read or understand his savings and investment statements). Such investors often benefit from professional investment management\u2014such as the management offered by a segregated fund. 4.3.10 Need for Suitability \u00b6 Suitability is a specific investment need that is very important to meet where the agent compares the features of an investment to the investor\u2019s investment objectives, constraints, and risk profile. The agent begins by seeking information from the investor about the purpose of the investment, expectations, wants, and needs. The investor must be clear about his objectives and concerns. The agent should never rely on old or outdated information. The agent then applies his knowledge of the client\u2019s objectives and limitations against investment characteristics and suggests recommendations to the investor wherein the investor may agree or disagree with the findings of the agent. If agreement is reached, then the investor decides to proceed with the recommendation(s). If agreement is not reached, the agent must gain further understanding from the client about his reasons for rejecting the recommendation(s). The agent takes that information away and begins the research process again. Suitability evolves from needs\u2019 analysis and know your client. The sucess in assessing suitability results from collecting more information and better understanding the client's needs. Suitability is established at the time an investment is made and it should be re-examined if there are significant changes in the life of the investor, such as retirement or if characteristics of the investment itself change. 4.3.11 Other specific investment needs \u00b6 Many other specific needs revealed in creating the investor profile can include the following: A need for tax-advantaged investing due to an investor\u2019s high marginal tax rate; A need to protect against the effect of inflation because the investor starts receiving fixed income at a somewhat young retirement age and anticipates, at least, an average life expectancy; A need to grow assets to meet estate planning goals, which could signify a need to take on more risk in the portfolio for potentially greater returns; A need to protect capital to purchase investments, such as an annuity for income purposes, and also to meet estate planning goals. 4.4 Government Retirement Pension Income \u00b6 Government-provided retirement pensions are the starting point for retirement income. An online resource called the \u201cCanadian Retirement Income Calculator\u201d is available to estimate retirement income. It is important for the agent to keep informed on current dollar limits for payments from the following government retirement income plans. Over time and through federal budgets, the criteria related to eligibility, contributions, and benefits of government retirement income fluctuate. 4.4.1 Old Age Security (OAS) \u00b6 Old Age Security (OAS) is a monthly retirement pension available for qualifying Canadians who are 65 and meet the requirements for legal status and residence in Canada. An individual may be automatically enrolled or he may need to apply to receive his pension. The individual can also defer starting the pension. OAS provides additional benefits for low-income earners. An online resource called the \u201cCanadian Retirement Income Calculator\u201d is available to estimate retirement income, found at: http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/services/pensions/cric.shtml . 4.4.1.1 OAS eligibility \u00b6 It is not a requirement to have ever worked to be entitled to OAS. Furthermore, OAS can be received by someone who continues to work. The pension is available to all Canadians who qualify whether they live in or outside of Canada. Note that it is also possible for a person to qualify for OAS and/or a pension from another country if the applicant has: Lived in a country that has a social security agreement with Canada; or Contributed to the social security system of that country. 4.4.1.2 OAS Contributions \u00b6 Contributions are not made directly to OAS. The Government of Canada funds the program through general tax revenues. 4.4.1.3 OAS benefits \u00b6 The retirement pension amount is established based on the amount of time the individual has lived in Canada since age 18. Depending on eligibility, OAS is paid as a full or partial pension. The partial pension is relative to the number of years of residency. If there is an increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the benefit is increased every January, April, July, and October. The pension can be deferred for up to 60 months after becoming eligible and is increased for every month it is not received. The monthly payment is increased by 0.6% it is deferred (7.2% per year) up to a maximum of 36% (7.2% \u00d7 5 years) at age 70. There is no requirement to start the pension at 70; however there are no additional increases to the amount received after age 70 except for increases linked to inflation. Example In 2014, Helena decides to defer receiving her OAS pension for one year because she is still working and has no need for the additional income. Her monthly benefit increases 0.6% per month over the year for a total increase of 7.2% (0.6% \u00d7 12 months). If she had started the pension immediately, she would have received $551 monthly. By waiting 12 months, it will increase to $590.67 monthly ( $551 + 7.2%). 4.4.1.4 Taxation of benefits \u00b6 OAS benefits are taxable income. The OAS pension is linked to income. The Income Tax Act establishes OAS payment thresholds, there are three levels of benefit: When a person earns less net income than the annual minimum threshold, he will receive 100% of his OAS pension. If he earns an amount between the minimum and the maximum threshold, he will find his OAS pension is reduced. If he earns more than the maximum threshold, he forfeits the entire pension and receives no OAS. When net income greater than the threshold falls between the minimum and maximum threshold, a lump-sum OAS repayment may be triggered and paid with the income tax return for the year. The repayment, or clawback, is presently 15% of the difference between net income and the threshold: Repayment = (net income - threshold) \u00d7 15% Example Ben earns $81,000 of net income in 2019. The applicable threshold for the OAS pension is $75,910. Therefore, he repays $763.50 (( $81,000 \u2013 $75,910) \u00d7 15%) of his OAS pension with his income tax return for 2019. To prevent repaying large sums in the future, benefits may be reduced by a recovery tax. It reduces monthly benefits. An annual reconciliation takes income and threshold into account. No recovery tax is charged if the income falls underneath the minimum threshold. Agents should consult the Government of Canada1 website on a yearly basis to validate the current annual threshold limits. 4.4.2 Canadian Pension Plan (CPP) and Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP) \u00b6 Almost all workers, between the ages of 18 and 70, and employers in Canada pay into the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). The CPP provides a retirement pension, survivor\u2019s pension, disability benefit, and death benefit. The Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP) is similar to the CPP for Qu\u00e9bec workers and employers. The QPP replaces the CPP in Qu\u00e9bec. There are some slight differences between the CPP and QPP such as the following: The Post-Retirement Benefit which does not exist in Qu\u00e9bec; Note that contributions to the QPP must continue if work continues while receiving retirement benefits. The different set of determinants used in Qu\u00e9bec regarding the surviving spouse of a QPP pensioner. 4.4.2.1 CPP eligibility \u00b6 To be eligible for a CPP retirement pension, a worker must have: Made one valid CPP contribution; and Submitted an application. Note that the application cannot be submitted until one month after turning 59. 4.4.2.2 CPP contributions \u00b6 Pensionable earnings refer to the amount contributed to the CPP based on employment income. Contributions start at a set level of income. In 2020, a person did not make CPP contributions if he earned less than $3,500 per year. Contributions are not made above the income level called the \u201cyear\u2019s maximum pensionable earnings\u201d (YMPE). \u201cPensionable earnings\u201d describes the contribution zone in-between the minimum and maximum income at which contributions cease. Contributions were made at the rate of 10.5% of pensionable earnings in 2020. The contribution is split between the employer and worker. The self-employed worker pays the full amount based on net business income. Government of Canada. Old Age Security payment amounts. [online]. Revised June 28, 2019. [Consulted July 22, 2019]. https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/old-age-security/payments.html The more contributed to the plan, the more ultimately paid as a pension (to the maximum). The amount received as a pension can be improved by dropping out from the pension calculation: A certain number of lowest-earning years. This is the general drop-out provision; A specified period of time for a caregiver who has no earnings or low earnings because he stayed home to raise his children (called the child-rearing provision). Contributions to the CPP end when the pension initiates\u2014at age 70 or death. The CPP retirement pension can commence while continuing to work. Contributions to the CPP resume by the employee and employer, or by the self-employed, and they go toward the payment of the Post-Retirement Benefit (PRB). The PRB is an additional pension available to contributors. It is paid for life and added to the CPP benefit. It is compulsory to make contributions to the PRB between ages 60 and 65 if work continues. At age 65 contributions become voluntary. 4.4.2.3 CPP benefits \u00b6 The amount received as a monthly retirement pension benefit is a result of: The number of years contributions are made; The amount contributed; The age at which the pension begins. The pension is increased on a yearly basis based on an increase in the cost of living as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The typical age to begin receiving the pension is 65\u2014it can start at the earliest at age 60. When the pension is received before age 65, the amount paid is reduced by the number of months the pension begins. Early pension is 0.6% per month or 7.2% per year (0.60 \u00d7 12 months). If a pensioner starts the pension at age 60 (i.e., five years early), his pension would be reduced by 36% (7.2% \u00d7 5 years). Example Loreen will retire at age 60 in 2017. She would receive $657.90 from the CPP at age 65. However, by beginning five years early, she incurs a reduction of 36% (7.2% \u00d7 5 years). At 60, Loreen will receive $421.06 ( $657.90 \u2013 ( $657.90 \u00d7 36%)) as her CPP retirement pension. The pensioner delaying his pension after age 65 enhances it over time. Every month the pension is not received, the benefit rises by 0.7% (8.4% per year). For example, a pensioner who waits the maximum of five years receives a 42% rise in the amount received (8.4% \u00d7 5 years). There is no further enhancement after age 70. Example Stephen decides the time for retirement will arrive when he turns 69 in 2017. As a result of waiting his CPP retirement pension is increased from its base, which would have been $922.44 at age 65, to $1,232.38 at age 69 ( $922.44 + (8.4% \u00d7 $922.44 \u00d7 4 years)). PRB recipients receive a benefit based on: Earnings; CPP contributions made in the previous year and The age at which the PRB begins. The maximum PRB benefit for per year is equal to 1/40 th of the maximum CPP retirement pension. The benefit is in proportion to contributions: for example, if PRB contributions are half the maximum, benefits are half the maximum. The deceased\u2019s CPP contributor\u2019s spouse and child or children are eligible for a survivor\u2019s pension: The amount received by the spouse is calculated based on: The deceased\u2019s age; The amount of time contributions were made; The amount contributed; and Whether CPP retirement or disability benefits are already being received. The child\u2019s benefit is payable to age 18 or up to age 25 if the child is attending school, college, or university full-time. The CPP also pays a disability benefit when the contributor becomes severely disabled for a prolonged time or and a death benefit when the contributor dies. 4.4.2.4 Taxation of benefits \u00b6 The CPP benefit is taxable income. 4.4.3 Benefits for low-income earners \u00b6 The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and the Allowance are monthly benefits paid to low-income OAS recipients. These benefits are not taxable. Supplementary pensions may be offered provincially to low-income retired residents Low-income benefit recipients will most likely not have enough income to invest. 4.4.3.1 GIS eligibility, contributions, and benefits \u00b6 The following are applicant requirements to receive the Guaranteed Income Supplement. Applicants must: Live in Canada; Be a legal Canadian resident; Meet the annual income test; and Make their application in writing. Contributions are not made to the GIS directly\u2014government revenues fund the GIS. The GIS benefit is available starting at age 65. The amount received is based on marital status and income. Income for a married couple is combined to determine the amount each spouse receives. 4.4.3.2 Allowance eligibility, contributions, and benefits \u00b6 The allowance is accessible to individuals: Who are 60 to 64 years old; and Whose married or common-law spouse receives the OAS and is eligible for GIS. It is not a requirement to make contributions to receive the benefit. As with OAS and GIS, other eligibility criteria include years of residency and income. The allowance is paid as a set benefit. An allowance for the survivor is available to individuals: With a low income; Living in Canada; and Whose married or common-law spouse is deceased. 4.5 Employer-Provided Retirement Pensions \u00b6 An employer-provided retirement pension is in place to reward employees by paying a future pension income. It is commonly called a \u201ccompany pension\u201d or \u201cprivate pension.\u201d Pension plans can take multiple forms and are funded by companies in both the public and private sector. These pensions are typically called \u201cregistered pension plans\u201d (RPPs). They include: Defined benefit pension plans (DBPPs); Defined contribution pension plans (DCPPs); Pooled registered pension plans (PRPPs). Savings in an RPP are a valuable asset for plan members. However, most Canadian workers are not members of an RPP. Therefore, they must personally fund future retirement costs by saving through other plans (such as an RRSP). All public sector employees are provided with a retirement pension from their employers (i.e., doctors, medical personnel, teachers, members of the police, and emergency services, etc.). Private sector employees may or may not be provided with an employer-provided retirement pension plan. Employees of firms that are federally regulated, such as bank employees, may be members of a pension plan that is registered federally. The plan sponsor (most often the employer) registers and maintains the RPP. A plan administrator is a person or third party that has ultimate responsibility for plan administration, such as enrolling new members, issuing pension statements and keeping records. He must also keep a detailed record if a plan member dies, retires, or terminates the plan. Plan members receive a brochure or booklet explaining the terms of their plan when they join. Vesting is a feature of RPPs that describes who owns the sponsor\u2019s contributions to the employees\u2019 plan when an employee leaves his employer. The employee\u2019s savings always remain his savings; they belong to him. The question arises: What about the money the employer has contributed to the departing employee\u2019s pension? The rules are determined by the pension benefits act of each jurisdiction in which the plan is registered. In the best case, vesting is immediate and the employee receives both his and his employer\u2019s contributions when he leaves. Less favourably, vesting occurs when the employee is required to stay a certain length of time with the employer before he is entitled to both contributions. Least favourably is when vesting is not immediate and the employee retains his pension contributions but does not receive his employer\u2019s contributions. Pension plan contributions, whether made by the employee or the employer, and growth of those contributions due to investment returns are locked-in. Locked-in means that an employee cannot access the value of this RPP until he reaches the retirement age specified in the plan of which he is a member or satisfies the terms of the locked-in account to which he transfers his savings as a result of having changed employer. There are only a few, very specific circumstances, in which the funds can be unlocked. Locking-in refers to the limitations put on the access to the money in an RPP. It applies to: Defined benefit pension plans (DBPPs); Defined contribution pension plans (DCPPs); Pooled registered pension plans (PRPPs). Under particular circumstances, it is possible to unlock the total value of an RPP. These circumstances include cases of financial hardship, shortened life expectancy (usually defined as two years or less) and a very low account balance. There are two phases to locked-in plans: a savings phase and an income phase. Locked-in plans: the savings phase An employee who is leaving a firm but is not retiring has several choices for his locked-in pension. During the savings phase he can: Leave the value of the pension in his former employer\u2019s plan; Transfer the pension value to the RPP of the new employer; Transfer the pension value to a locked-in account at a financial institution; Use the pension value to purchase a deferred life annuity. A person who transfers his pension value to a locked-in account at a financial institution will move his funds to a Locked-in RRSP (also called an LRSP) or locked-in retirement account (LIRA) based on where he resides. The account owner makes the investment decisions for these accounts. The investment types available are the same as those in an RRSP. The main advantages of the locked-in account are that it continues to add investment growth to the contributions in the account. Therefore, savings build, withdrawals are prevented, and tax continues to be deferred. An employee who never changes employers or who leaves contributions with the employer after he has gone to work elsewhere still receives his DBPP pension during retirement. He has no need for transfer options or locked-in accounts. However, an employee with a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) must transfer his contributions at retirement to a locked-in account. RPP contributors cannot access their locked-in plans\u2019 value before the specified retirement age. The plan is locked in to ensure that withdrawals are not made until the retirement age. If funds are not locked-in, withdrawals could be made, and the account value diminished before the beginning of retirement. Locked-in plans: the income phase The savings phase shifts into the income phase when the Locked-in RRSP or LIRA is converted to another form of locked-in plan that is structured to issue payments. This must take place no later than the end of the year in which the plan owner turns 71. Options available for the income phase of the RPP are established at a financial institution. They include the following: Life income fund (LIF); Locked-in retirement income fund (LRIF); Prescribed registered retirement income fund (PRRIF) for those whose plans are registered in Saskatchewan or Manitoba; Restricted life income fund (RLIF) for those with a federally regulated pension. A life annuity may also be acquired from a life insurer by moving funds from the Locked-in RRSP or LIRA. An income stream is created because a minimum annual withdrawal must be taken from the LIF/LRIF/PRRIF/RLIF account and paid to the account owner. Withdrawals can commence at the retirement age set by the terms of the pension plan. There is a limit to the maximum annual withdrawal, except the PRRIF, which has no maximum. The life annuity pays a regular income to its annuitant. An employee may end up with multiple pensions from multiple employers. Example Roger, aged 58, had a defined contribution plan with his employer, in Regina, SK. It vested 14 years ago. Roger is laid off and decides to transfer his pension plan contributions to a LIRA, in which he can make the investment decisions. One year after being laid off, Roger accepts a new job. This employer provides a defined benefit plan pension. Roger joins the plan. On retirement, at age 67, Roger converts his LIRA to a PRRIF. He begins to make regular withdrawals from the PRRIF and receives a monthly pension cheque from his second employer. Contributions to an RPP reduce the RRSP deduction limit for the subsequent year. This is called a \u201cpension adjustment\u201d (PA). The PA is reported to the employee on his T4 (Statement of Remuneration Paid) or T4A (Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity and Other Income). Example Heather receives a T4 from her employer showing a pension adjustment of $4,366 for the previous calendar year. Her RRSP deduction limit for this year is $7,880. However, the pension adjustment reduces her deduction limit to $3,514 ( $7,880 \u2013 $4,366). 4.5.1 Defined benefit pension plan (DBPP) \u00b6 The defined benefit pension plan (DBPP) makes a dependable contribution to retirement income needs. The DBPP pays an income on retirement that is known in advance, lasts for life, has a provision for the spouse when the employee dies and is often indexed to increases in the cost of living. A DBPP member makes no investment decisions, and the plan sponsor selects the investments that will make the promised pension at retirement. A DBPP is provided on a group basis to employees. An \u201cindividual pension plan\u201d (IPP) is a defined benefit plan for business owners and directors. 4.5.1.1 DBPP eligibility \u00b6 A plan can be made for: All of the company employees; or A class of employees. When a pension plan is created on a class basis, every employee in that particular class is entitled to join the plan after working the necessary amount of time to qualify for plan membership. A full-time employee is entitled to join a plan after two years of continuous employment, called \u201cservice,\u201d unless the terms of the plan authorize the employee to join earlier. A part-time employee is entitled to join after 24 months of employment. He must meet one of two criteria (whichever is less): 700 hours of work; or 35% of the year\u2019s maximum pensionable earnings (YMPE) in the previous two years. 4.5.1.2 DBPP contributions \u00b6 The plan sponsor selects a plan that is either contributory or non-contributory: Contributory plan\u2014employees and the employer contribute; Non-contributory plan\u2014only the employer contributes. The employer\u2019s contribution to funding the pension plan is determined by an actuarial estimation of the amount required to pay for pensions in the future. When a plan is contributory, an employee may be able to make additional voluntary contributions (AVC) that will generate a higher pension. These contributions are deposited into a separate account that is structured as a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) in which the employee makes investment decisions. These plans are referred to as \u201ccombination plans\u201d or \u201chybrid plans.\u201d An employee who is entitled to enrollment in his employer\u2019s DBPP can contribute for both current service and past service. This occurs if a pension plan is initiated by a sponsor; it recognizes employment retroactively. The maximum contribution limit per year is set at 1/9 th of the sum available to make a payment to a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP). This amount is determined by the Income Tax Act. 4.5.1.3 DBPP benefits \u00b6 The amount received by the former employee is typically calculated in one of three ways: By final average earnings: Based on average earnings in the years leading up to retirement. By career average earnings: Based on average earnings during the entire period of plan membership. A flat benefit: Based on a fixed-dollar amount for each year of plan membership. The rate at which benefits accrue cannot be more than 2% of a plan member\u2019s remuneration for the year to a maximum annual dollar amount. Some plans help to protect the benefit from inflation by raising the benefit fully or partially in step with rises in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). A member of a DBPP can elect to obtain the commuted value of his pension at retirement or when employment ends. The commuted value is a lump-sum payment representing the present value of the pension. Commuted values are locked-in, and the sum must be transferred to another account that continues locking-in, such as a LIRA. When the employee receives the commuted value he becomes his own pension manager and through his choice of investments will try to create lifelong income for himself and his spouse. Benefits can be put at risk for DBPP members if the pension plan is underfunded and the plan sponsor fails to make its required contributions to the plan. On the death of a DBPP member, his spouse will receive at least 60% of the pension. If there is no spouse, a beneficiary may receive a lump-sum payment representing a commuted value of the pension. 4.5.2 Defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) \u00b6 A defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) is also called a \u201cmoney purchase plan\u201d (MPP). The amount paid as retirement income for a DCPP member is completely dependent on contributions and investment income that build up in the plan. The employer makes no obligations to the amount of pension that will be received. Thus, the plan member is not aware of the income to anticipate during his retirement. A DCPP member determines how to invest contributions. He receives a menu of investment choices and a default investment option. The default option is used when the member does not make another investment choice from the existing options. The plan member is partly responsible for the sum available to him as a pension since the outcome of his investment decisions affects the plan\u2019s final value. 4.5.2.1 DCPP eligibility \u00b6 Full-time employees are often required by their employers to join their DCPP plan, whereas other employers leave the choice up to the employee. There is no compulsory waiting period for full-time employees. Part-time employees may be qualified to join as well. However, part-time employees may have to meet equivalent eligibility requirements as for a DBPP. 4.5.2.2 DCPP contributions \u00b6 DCPP contributions may be made by the employee and the employer. Employers are required to make a mandatory minimum contribution. Employee contributions are not mandatory, and supplementary voluntary contributions may not be approved. There is no contribution to a DCPP allowed for previous service. The Income Tax Act establishes the yearly contribution limit. The employer provides information regarding investments to the employee. The employee selects the investment(s) or is assigned the default option. 4.5.2.3 DCPP benefits \u00b6 The retirement pension from a DCPP is a result of: Amount of contributions; When contributions are made; and Investment performance. There are no guarantees regarding the amount received as a pension. The employer that has sponsored the DCPP does not pay the pension. The accumulated funds in the plan must be moved to a locked-in account at retirement. The retiree will keep his savings in a locked-in savings account if he has not reached the age to start receiving income. He will move the account value to an income fund or life annuity when he is ready to begin receiving income. 4.5.3 Pooled registered pension plan (PRPP) \u00b6 The newest form of pension is the pooled registered pension plan (PRPP). In Qu\u00e9bec, the plan is called the \u201cVoluntary Retirement Savings Plan\u201d (VRSP) and must be put into place when an employer does not offer a registered pension plan and has at least five employees. Administrators provincially register plans. Following registration, administrators propose the plan to self-employed employers and people. The administrator is a third party that provides the PRPP and is responsible for its operations. Note that an administrator is not an employer. A PRPP is a pension plan similar to a DCP, with the exception that employer contributions are not obligatory. Its objective is to give a low-cost retirement savings plan for those who are not members of RPPs or employer savings plans. The plan is based on the idea of pooled contributions\u2014a way to lessen fees for members. 4.5.3.1 PRPP eligibility \u00b6 Full-time employees are eligible to join a PRPP right away. Part-time employees can join a PRPP after finishing 24 months of uninterrupted employment. When they are eligible, employees are automatically enrolled in the plan selected by a participating employer. An employee who does not want to join the PRPP must withdraw within 60 days of notification of enrollment. 4.5.3.2 PRPP contributions \u00b6 Employee and employer contributions are not compulsory. They are made as a deduction from payroll earnings; this contribution \u201cat source\u201d helps encourage savings. The RRSP contribution limit is equal to the maximum limit for a yearly contribution. Transfers to the PRPP can be made from an individual\u2019s RRSP, registered retirement income fund (RRIF) or deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP). Contributions are invested in line with the choices made available by the plan administrator. 4.5.3.3 PRPP benefits \u00b6 Funds are locked-in with the same restrictions as other locked-in pension savings. Retirement income will be based on the amount saved, when contributions are made, investment performance and which transfer choice is used for the locked-in funds. 4.6 Employer Provided Savings Plan \u00b6 Savings plans are made available to employees from employers as: Deferred profit sharing plans (DPSPs); Group registered retirement savings plan (GRRSPs). These plans are not overseen by pension standards legislation and do not have the locking-in provisions of employer-provided pensions. 4.6.1 Deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP) \u00b6 Companies offer deferred profit-sharing plans to share a portion of their business profits with employees who are plan members. 4.6.1.1 DPSP eligibility \u00b6 Employees eligible for plan membership are determined by the DPSP sponsor. Significant company shareholders and their close family members are not eligible. 4.6.1.2 DPSP contributions \u00b6 The employer is the only one who makes contributions. There is not a minimum contribution amount\u2014contributions have a maximum limit which is lesser of 18% of a member\u2019s annual compensation or 50% of the DCPP limit. Vesting is provided in a two-year maximum. The DPSP value is not locked-in-a withdrawal may be made while the plan member is still employed. The plan member controls how the value of the account is invested. Contributions create a pension adjustment and as a result reduce available RRSP contribution room. All withdrawals are taxable to the employee at the same rate as regular income. 4.6.1.3 DPSP benefits \u00b6 When a DPSP member retires or moves to another employer, he can: Receive the proceeds of the plan as a lump sum; Purchase an annuity; Transfer funds to an RRSP or RRIF. A member can start to receive income payments from the plan when he retires. The plans\u2019 value may be transferred to another RPP or DPSP by a plan member who is not retiring. 4.6.2 Group registered retirement savings plan (GRRSP) \u00b6 A GRRSP is the same as an RRSP provided to individuals with the exception that a GRRSP is offered on a group basis. Group plans require members to pay lower fees than they would pay on an individual plan. However, a GRRSP may offer fewer investment choices. A GRRSP is also a payroll savings plan, thus, members can enjoy the long-term benefits of regular savings. RRSP features such as the Home Buyers\u2019 Plan (HBP) or Lifelong Learning Plan (LLP) may be available to plan members with a GRRSP. 4.6.2.1 GRRSP eligibility, contributions, and benefits \u00b6 There are no limits regarding GRRSP eligibility. Contributions are made by the employee and can be made by the employer. Employee contributions are tax-deductible for the employee. Employer contributions are taxable income for the employee. Contributions to both personal RRSP and GRRSP cannot surpass an individual\u2019s total RRSP annual deduction limit. The plan value is not locked-in. Transfer options include: Member\u2019s personal RRSP or RRIF; Annuity; and Cash. 4.7 Individual Registered Savings Plan \u00b6 Individual registered savings plans are personal investment accounts. They are registered with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) by the institution that holds the plan\u2019s account. For example, you open an RRSP account at Bank ABC. Bank ABC registers the account with the CRA. The plan owner receives tax benefits with their individual registered savings plans because they are registered with the CRA. These tax benefits are not available with non-registered accounts. Registered plans are available to save for: Retirement (in an RRSP and RRIF); Tax-free saving and investing (in a TFSA); Cost of post-secondary education (in an RESP); Costs of long-term disability (in an RDSP). The following registered plans are available to address personal savings needs. 4.7.1 Registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) \u00b6 A registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) is an account designed to save for retirement. A registered retirement income fund (RRIF) is an account that pays an income during retirement from RRSP savings. RRSPs are a voluntary savings program that was introduced to promote saving for retirement through tax incentives. RRSPs are offered by many financial institutions and may hold segregated funds when offered by life insurance companies. An RRSP account owner has responsibility for decisions concerning the investments of his contributions. There are three types of RRSP accounts: RRSP ACCOUNT FEATURES A managed account The investor has a choice of investments that may include Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs), mutual funds, and segregated funds. A self-directed account The investor has a broad choice of investments, including all those available through a managed account plus many others such as stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A fully managed account A professional money manager creates and manages a customized investment portfolio. Fees that can be charged against an RRSP include: RRSP ACCOUNT FEATURES Administrative or trustee fees Cover the financial institution\u2019s cost of looking after the account. Investment fees (depending on the investment) For buying, selling, and switching. Account change fees For closing the account, changing the withdrawal schedule, and/or making a lump-sum withdrawal. A person can own an unlimited number of RRSP accounts. Nevertheless, if accounts are consolidated, each account may charge an administration fee and to eliminate duplicate fees, account owners typically try to limit the number of their RRSP accounts. The maximum annual contribution limit across all accounts cannot be surpassed, regardless of the number of accounts. An RRSP can disclose many of its owner\u2019s characteristics: Investments show risk tolerance; The form of account (managed or self-directed) can indicate investment experience or lack of investment knowledge; Contributions specify dedication to savings and concern for retirement income; Contributions post-retirement indicate unused contribution room is available and, in the absence of contributing income from work, savings are being redirected from non-registered accounts; Contributions to a spousal plan may indicate a need to create a spousal retirement income, and/or a desire to split retirement income and reduce tax. RRSPs offer the following tax benefits: The contribution made to the RRSP can be deducted from income tax and may move the taxpayer into a lower tax bracket, as a result lowering his marginal tax rate; The investment income earned in the account is not taxed until it is withdrawn, leaving a larger sum in the account to invest and grow. Those with RRSP accounts may use the value in their accounts for the Home Buyer\u2019s Plan (HBP) and Lifelong Learning Plan (LLP). Both plans permit the plan owner to make a tax-free withdrawal from the RRSP account. The HBP is used when buying or building a qualifying home for the individual or a related person with a disability. The LLP withdrawal is used to pay the costs of full-time education or training for an adult or his spouse. Both plans restrict the amount that can be withdrawn and state the conditions for use of the funds and repayment. Repayment can be added to taxable income as a penalty if it does not take place according to the plan\u2019s terms. 4.7.1.1 RRSP eligibility and contributions \u00b6 To contribute to a personal RRSP, an individual must: Contribute before reaching the maximum age limit of 71 years of age (determined on the December 31 of the year one turns 71); Have earned income for the preceding year; and Have filed an income tax return for the previous year in which business or employment income was declared. Have contribution room available from a previous year because the account owner did not make his maximum contribution in that year. In this way, RRSP contribution room is carried forward to subsequent years, and is formally called the \u201ccarry-forward provision.\u201d Example Sarah has been earning $40,000 per year in her job at a call centre for the last two years. She is able to save about $1,000 per year in her RRSP. She could contribute up to $7,200 per year based on her income ( $40,000 \u00d7 18%). The $6,200 difference ( $7,200 \u2013 $1,000) between her contribution and her contribution limit is not used. Thanks to the carry-forward provision of the RRSP, the difference accumulates and rolls over to be available in future years. In five years, based on her same income and level of annual contribution, Sarah will have $31,000 ( $6,200 \u00d7 5) in contribution room. Contributions can be made to an RRSP during the entire year. The CRA sets a date, typically 60 days after December 31, as the final date for contributions of the past year. The annual contribution limit is the lesser of: 18% of earned income for the past year; Maximum dollar limit set for the year. Income received from salaries and wages, employment bonuses, alimony, rental income, and business income is earned income. Income received from investments, or pension benefits is not included in earned income. An individual\u2019s annual contribution limit is reduced by: Pension adjustment: the amount contributed to an RPP or DPSP in the past year; Spousal plan contribution. The plan owner could use the carry-forward contribution room, created by not making the maximum contribution in past years, on top of the sum that can be contributed to an RRSP annually. A one-time over-contribution of $2,000 is also allowed. The over-contribution is not tax-deductible and will grow on a tax-deferred basis. If a plan owner contributes more than $2,000, a 1% penalty tax is applied monthly against the excess contribution. When funds are transferred into an RRSP from a DPSP, GRRSP, or another RRSP, the transfer is not regarded as a contribution. DPSPs, GRRSPs, and RRSPs are all registered accounts and so money transferred between them has already been counted as a contribution and will not be counted again. 4.7.1.2 Spousal RRSP plan \u00b6 A spouse (husband, wife, or common-law partner) funds an spousal RRSP or common-law partner plan for the benefit of the other spouse. The RRSP spousal plan is a way to split income for the couple during retirement between one spouse who has a higher marginal tax rate than the other and, therefore, reduce total income tax for the couple. Contributions are made by one spouse to the other spouse\u2019s plan. The amount that can be contributed is based on the contribution room of the contributor. This reduces his RRSP contribution room. Example Julie has available contribution room of $9,600 this year for her RRSP. She sets up a spousal RRSP for her common-law partner, Tony. She deposits $2,500 to Tony\u2019s spousal RRSP. Julie\u2019s contribution to her own RRSP now cannot exceed $7,100 ( $9,600 \u2013 $2,500). When they retire, Julie will be in a higher tax bracket than Tony because she has pension benefits and other private income. If she had not set up the plan for Tony, all her RRSP withdrawals would be taxed at her marginal tax rate as income. However, through the spousal plan, withdrawals from Tony\u2019s plan will be taxed at his marginal tax rate, which is lower than Julie\u2019s. The amount of withdrawal (up to the amount contributed) will be added to the contributing spouse\u2019s taxable income in the year of the withdrawal, if the spouse who has received funds into his RRSP from the other makes a withdrawal from the plan in the year the deposit is made or the two calendar years following that year. Solely, the contributed portion of the withdrawal is attributed back to the donor spouse, not the growth portion, if the withdrawal is a combination of contributed money and growth on that money. Having a spousal RRSP can prolong the tax benefit of contributions past age 71 if the recipient spouse is younger. Contributions can be made until the RRSP matures when the younger spouse reaches the end of the year in which he turns 71. 4.7.1.3 RRSP withdrawals \u00b6 RRSP withdrawals can be made at any time. The financial institution holding the account must hold back a portion of the withdrawal in a withholding tax. The withholding tax does not represent the entire tax amount that will be owed on the withdrawal; rather, it represents an advance payment. Note that there may be additional tax owed\u2014the balance will be calculated when the income tax return is filed. There are separate withholding tax rates for Qu\u00e9bec. The withholding rate increases in relation to the withdrawal, as shown in Table 4.1. Table 4.1 Federal withholding tax on RRSP withdrawals WITHDRAWAL FEDERAL WITHHOLDING TAX OUTSIDE QU\u00c9BEC FEDERAL WITHHOLDING TAX IN QU\u00c9BEC 0 \u2013 up to $5,000 10% 5% $5,001 \u2013 up to and including $15,000 20% 10% $15,001 or more 30% 15% Qu\u00e9bec residents making a withdrawal from their RRSP (no matter the amount) must pay an additional 15% provincial withholding tax. 4.7.1.4 RRSP maturity \u00b6 Upon RRSP maturity (i.e., at the end of the year in which an RRSP account owner turns 71), the account owner must transfer the funds in the account to continue tax deferral. Income-paying options, also called \u201cmaturity options\u201d, include: A registered retirement income fund (RRIF): Investments in the RRSP can be transferred \"in kind\" to the RRIF, in which case they are simply switched from the RRSP to RRIF without having to be sold. This would be true if the RRSP was invested in segregated funds, for instance. The segregated funds are transferred from the RRSP to the RRIF. A term annuity to age 90 or a life annuity: The investments in the RRSP must be sold so the cash can be used to pay for the annuity. It is not necessary to pick only one option. Funds in the RRSP can be split across options, for instance, a RRIF and a life annuity. The plan owner may want some future flexibility in regard to income and this is satisfied by the RRIF. He uses the annuity to provide a guaranteed income stream for life. 4.7.1.5 Death of RRSP owner \u00b6 An RRSP can name a qualified beneficiary, or a beneficiary (including the estate) to receive the account value when the RRSP owner dies. A qualified beneficiary of an RRSP is the plan owner\u2019s spouse or common-law partner, or a child or grandchild who is financially dependent because he is a minor or because he has physical or mental impairment. This choice of beneficiary continues the tax deferral of the account. When a qualified beneficiary is named for the plan, the value of the RRSP at the time of death of the plan owner is transferred to the beneficiary and reported on the beneficiary\u2019s tax return for that year. If the beneficiary is a spouse who then contributes the amount received to an RRSP, RRIF, PRPP, SPP, or qualifying annuity in the year it is received (or within 60 days thereafter), the spouse can claim a tax deduction to offset the income received. A financially dependent disabled child has the same transfer options as the spouse (RRSP, PRPP, SPP, RRIF, annuity) plus an option to contribute to a registered disability savings plan (RDSP). A financially dependent child who is not disabled has only the annuity option available for transfer-ring the funds. The annuity can provide for payments based on a period of not more than 18 years, minus the child's or grandchild's age at the time the annuity was purchased. The payments from the annuity must begin no later than one year after the annuity is purchased. Beneficiaries are not restricted to spouses or children; anyone can be named a beneficiary of an RRSP. In this case, the account will be collapsed. The CRA considers that the deceased account owner received the fair market value (FMV) of all the property held in the RRSP at the time of death. The tax return for the deceased will include this amount and any other proceeds received from the plan in the year of death. Therefore, it is included in the income of the deceased and tax is paid by the estate. 4.7.2 Registered retirement income fund (RRIF) \u00b6 Registered retirement income funds (RRIFs) are a maturity option for RRSPs. The RRIF account\u2019s function is to pay retirement income (even though income can begin before retirement). A RRIF is funded by transferring the value of an RRSP account and continues tax deferral on the RRSP account. An individual with an RRIF account is responsible for making decisions regarding the type of account (managed or self-directed) he will have. A RRIF has the same investment options available as an RRSP. 4.7.2.1 RRIF withdrawals \u00b6 A RRIF account owner, who is called the annuitant, is necessary to make a minimum yearly withdrawal from his account. There is no withholding tax on the minimum withdrawal, but it will be considered taxable income when his income tax return is filed for the year. A withholding tax applies to any amount of withdrawal in excess of the minimum amount. The minimum withdrawal amount is a percentage of the account that increases with age, as shown in Table 4.2. The percentage charged is based on the age of the account owner on January 1 and the RRIF value. Withdrawals can be based on the age of a younger spouse and will make the account last longer if the minimum is withdrawn because a smaller percentage of account value is taken. Table 4.2 Minimum yearly withdrawal from RRIF, pre-March 2020. After March 2020, minimum withdrawal reduced by 25%. Note that a measure taken during the coronavirus pandemic, in March 2020, was the reduction of the annual withdrawal requirements for RRIFs, as shown in the above table, by 25%. Though the reduction is indicated for 2020 only, it is possible that the reduction will remain in place past 2020. Withdrawals are all taxed at an equal rate as income regardless of how the account has been invested and whether capital gains and losses, and dividends have been earned. Thus, there is no tax advantage to investing in equities in an RRSP or RRIF. The advantages of equities lie in their potential regarding: Stimulating higher rates of return; and Increasing overall account growth and value. The minimum withdrawal does not need to be taken in cash. Just like an input to a RRIF from an RRSP can be made \u201cin kind\u201d so, too, can an \u201cin kind\u201d transfer be made out of the RRIF. In-kind means the RRIF account owner can take the investment and transfer it to a non-registered investment account or tax-free savings account (TFSA). RRIF withdrawals do not have a maximum limit, providing the account owner with flexibility as well as the ability to meet unexpected expenses. It can also cause the account to be depleted at a faster rate than anticipated, and is therefore subject to longevity risk. 4.7.2.2 Death of RRIF owner \u00b6 Unlike an RRSP, a RRIF is oriented towards regular income payments. The person who receives those payments is the annuitant. When the annuitant dies, a successor annuitant of the account can receive those payments. The successor annuitant must be a spouse or common-law partner. A successor annuitant has several choices for using the proceeds: He can replace the deceased as holder of the RRIF and continues to receive the payments made to the deceased; or He can transfer the assets in-kind into his own RRIF and continue to receive the payments made to the deceased; or He can roll the RRIF assets in-kind into his RRSP. Doing this does not affect the survivor\u2019s contri-bution room. To prevent probate fees on the account value at death, a beneficiary should be named for the RRIF account. These do not apply in Qu\u00e9bec. There are no tax consequences to the estate when there is a successor annuitant. Alternatively, a spouse or common-law partner, plus a child or grandchild who is dependent because of a physical or mental impairment can be named as a qualifying beneficiary. Just as anyone can be named a beneficiary of an RRSP, so too can any person be named benefi-ciary of a RRIF. A beneficiary will not have to pay income tax on any amount paid out of the RRIF if it has been included in the deceased annuitant\u2019s income. If a beneficiary is not named, the value of the RRIF becomes part of the estate and subject to probate fees according the province in which the estate is based. The value of the RRIF is included as income on the RRIF-holder\u2019s final tax return and taxed accordingly. 4.7.3 Tax-free savings account (TFSA) \u00b6 A tax-free savings account (TFSA) is a registered savings account that is tax-free. Investment returns earned by deposits to the account (i.e., capital gains) and withdrawals are not taxable. A TFSA can be used for any savings goal. TFSAs can be opened by a person: Over 18-year-old; and With a valid social insurance number. A TFSA is a registered account. It is highly suitable for those whose withdrawals from registered savings have already been taxed, and who are seeking a means to avoid further taxation on their money. For example, a RRIF withdrawal is taxed. Its account owner may not need the entire withdrawal for living expenses. If the money is deposited to a non-TFSA and earns investment growth, the account owner will be taxed again on that growth. On the other hand, if the money is deposited to a TFSA, there will be no future tax. 4.7.3.1 TFSA contributions \u00b6 TFSA Contributions are not tax-deductible. TFSA contributions have a yearly dollar limit. The amount contributed to the TFSA is not based on earned income. A person who does not work and receives money can deposit the money to a TFSA. Note that he would not be able to contribute to an RRSP because he did not earn RRSP contribution room. Example Sandy retired last year. This year she is not working. Her aunt died during the year and left Sandy an inheritance of $50,000. Sandy cannot deposit the sum to an RRSP because she does not have earned income and has no available carry-forward contribution room. However, she can deposit it to a TFSA in an amount equal to her unused TFSA contribution room. The TFSA account offers a broad range of investment options (such as GICs, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and segregated funds). Like an RRSP, contribution room not used is carried forward. Over-contributions may occur when a withdrawal and deposit are made in a single year. Over-contributions are penalized: A charge of 1% per month on an excess contribution until a withdrawal of the excess is made; If an over-contribution is considered intentional\u2014any investment gains on the excess are taxed at a rate of 100%. To ensure that a penalty does not occur, it is best that no deposit be made in the same year as a withdrawal. 4.7.3.2 TFSA withdrawals \u00b6 TFSA withdrawals can be made at any time and re-contributed in any year following the year of the withdrawal. This is in addition to the maximum dollar amount of contribution for that year. No tax is due on the withdrawal. Eligibility for federal income-tested benefits (such as OAS and GIS) is not affected by income earned in a TFSA and withdrawals from the account. A TFSA in the common law provinces can name a successor holder and/or name a beneficiary to continue to receive account benefits if the owner dies. In Qu\u00e9bec, the account value passes through the will to inheritors. If a spouse is named inheritor of the TFSA, he can roll the account into his personal account without affecting unused contribution room if the spouse does so within the allotted period of time, and with the requisite CRA form. The successor holder must be a spouse or common-law partner who becomes the account owner and the account continues. The designated beneficiary can receive the account value and pay tax only on the growth of the account between the death of the account owner and the time of inheritance. 4.7.4 Registered education savings plan (RESP) \u00b6 A registered education savings plan (RESP) is a registered plan to promote savings that will pay toward higher education costs: The \u201csubscriber\u201d is the person who opens the plan. The \u201cbeneficiary\u201d is the person who receives payments from the RESP. RESPS are generally used for children, but they can technically be used for a person of any age. Savings in an RESP account grow tax-deferred and are supplemented by contributions from the federal government for children 17 years and younger. 4.7.4.1 Types of RESPs \u00b6 RESPs are provided by: Financial institutions; Scholarship plan dealers (these are beyond the scope of this course). Individual and family RESPs are available through financial institutions: An individual plan has a single beneficiary. Anyone can open the plan and contribute to it; A family plan can have more than one beneficiary and each beneficiary must be related to the subscriber. 4.7.4.2 RESP contributions \u00b6 Regardless of whether the RESP is an individual or family plan, there is a lifetime contribution limit per beneficiary of $50,000. Contributions are not tax-deductible. Contributions must be made to the plan in order to qualify for the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG) and the Canada Learning Bond. If the beneficiary continues into post-secondary education, the grant is not repaid to the government. The financial institution in which the RESP account is opened makes the application for the CESG. The Canada Learning Bond pays an additional grant to low-income subscribers. If the grant\u2019s complete amount for any year is not received, it builds up and can be carried forward until the end of the year in which the beneficiary turns 17. Low-income subscribers may receive an additional grant from the federal government in the Canada Learning Bond. Savings incentives for post-secondary education costs are offered by the provinces of Alberta and Qu\u00e9bec. Contributions in the account can be invested according to the products offered by the financial institution holding the account. A broad variety of investment choices is available. Tax is not paid on the value of the plan, including investment growth until withdrawals commence. 4.7.4.3 RESP withdrawals \u00b6 An RESP beneficiary (i.e., the student) receives withdrawals from the plan as Educational Assistance Payments (EAPs). EAPs are paid only when the student is enrolled in an eligible educational program. An EAP consists of: The Canada Education Savings Grant; The Canada Learning Bond; Any amount paid under a provincial education savings program; and The earnings on the money saved in the RESP. Withdrawals are taxed in the hands of the beneficiary. The EAPs are typically tax-free since most students have little income. 4.7.5 Registered disability savings plan (RDSP) \u00b6 The registered disability savings plan (RDSP) is a registered savings plan to assist parents and others save for the financial needs of a child or person with a severe and long-lasting impairment in physical or mental functions. 4.7.5.1 RDSP eligibility \u00b6 A disabled person is eligible to be a beneficiary who: Is eligible for the disability tax credit (disability amount); Is a Canadian resident; Is under 60 years of age (if 59, the individual must apply before the end of the calendar year in which he turns 59); and Has a social insurance number. 4.7.5.2 RDSP contributions \u00b6 Contributions are not tax-deductible. There is a lifetime private contribution limit for an RDSP of $200,000. There is no annual contribution limit. Private contributions result from: Regular savings; Lump sum contributions (i.e., an inheritance or a life insurance policy death benefit); or A rollover from a deceased individual\u2019s RRSP, RRIF, or RPP. The federal government may pay a matching Canada Disability Savings Grant of up to 300% of private contributions based on the amount contributed and the beneficiary\u2019s family income. There is a maximum annual grant and a lifetime limit. Grants are paid into the RDSP until the end of the calendar year in which the beneficiary turns 49 years. Low-income and modest-income individuals may annually receive a Canada Disability Savings Bond into their RDSPs from the government: The bond is paid into an RDSP even if no contributions were made to the plan; Bonds are paid into the RDSP until the end of the calendar year in which the beneficiary turns 49. RDSPs can be carried forward. Unused grant and bond entitlements from the past 10 years (starting from 2008) can be claimed for existing RDSPs, or RDSPs opened in January 2011 or later. The amount of Grant and Bond is based on the beneficiary\u2019s family income in those years. The Grant amount paid is also dependent on how much is contributed to the RDSP. Grants and Bonds are paid on entitlements that are not used up to a yearly maximum. 4.7.5.3 RDSP payments \u00b6 Only the RDSP beneficiary or his or her legal representative may receive payments. RDSP payments are made as: A \u201cDisability Assistance Payment\u201d (DAP): The DAP is a single payment. It can be received only if private contributions to the plan are greater than government contributions. A \u201cLifetime Disability Assistance Payment\u201d (LDAP): The LDAP is a sequence of payments. Once the plan beneficiary requests an LDAP, these payments are made to the beneficiary on at least a yearly basis until plan termination or death. This payment must begin no later than the beneficiary\u2019s age 60. Investment income earned in the plan accumulates tax-free. Nevertheless, grants, bonds, and investment income earned in the plan are included in the beneficiary\u2019s income for tax purposes when paid out of the RDSP. 4.8 Investor Profile \u00b6 The information collected in the profile shows the client\u2019s overall financial situation which comes into focus when: Financial results are analyzed; Needs are identified; and Risks are determined. 4.8.1 Results of financial review \u00b6 The financial review shows: How much has been saved; How much is available to meet current and future needs and objectives; Income restrictions, such as for locked-in accounts; Whether new plans and accounts need to be opened; The performance of current investments; Whether the current approach to saving and investing is suitable and will meet investor objectives or whether changes should be implemented. Weaknesses may be identified as a result of this review. A new strategy could be formulated as a result of this review to address these weaknesses and move the investor closer to his objectives. 4.8.2 Results of needs review \u00b6 The needs review identifies what is important to the investor. To set his objectives, the investor should arrange his needs in line with financial data. 4.8.3 Determination of risk tolerance \u00b6 Risk tolerance measures the investor tolerance for taking risks to attain investment objectives. Fund investments plot five measures on the risk scale: low, medium-low, medium, medium-high, and high. An investor will indicate which of those measures matches up with his personal risk tolerance or his agent will guide him to the correct match through a needs\u2019 analysis. Rating risk tolerance requires an agent to take time in client discussions to try and understand investor motivation, fears, and hopes to arrive at an accurate assessment and not rely only on an investor\u2019s self-assessment. Some indicators of risk tolerance are: Account and investment statements indicate investment experience, knowledge, and acceptance of volatility through existing investments; Acceptance of risk is demonstrated in the analysis of personal risks; Accounts in place and their level of funding demonstrate an approach to being risk-ready; Age and circumstances indicate an ability to recover losses. Example Alex believes that he can tolerate some risk in his investments, and when asked by his advisor, Morris, Alex states he has a medium-high risk tolerance. Alex\u2019s interpretation of medium-high means he would accept up to an 8% loss in his invested capital. Morris\u2019s interpretation of medium to high risk tolerance is up to a 15% loss in invested capital. If Morris proceeds to invest Alex\u2019s money on this basis, Alex\u2019s risk tolerance will be exceeded. Alex may result in taking on far more risk than he actually wants. Lifestyle risks are not an indicator of financial risk tolerance. Investors may have differing degrees of risk tolerance for differing investment objectives and time horizons. For example, saving for retirement might have a difference risk tolerance than saving for a holiday. A longer the time horizon might have a higher the tolerance for risk because the more time available for investing the better the probability that invested money will grow and earn a positive return. When time is short, the investor does not have the time to wait for a loss to turn around. Therefore, the risk tolerance is zero or very low. Example Sally and Mark are saving for their retirement, which they now anticipate will happen in three years. When they retire they will be depending on their retirement savings in their RRSPs since neither has a private pension. It is essential that their savings are not diminished and, correspondingly, they do not want to incur investment losses. If they did, they would have to delay retirement because they would need to work longer to make up for those losses. Therefore, they have zero risk tolerance. \u2022 Investors are known to accept or even pursue risk, sometimes at a level unsuitable to their actual tolerance for losses, because higher risk investments may pay better returns than low risk investments. The potentially better return, earned as a higher percentage and/or tax advantage, entices the investor (who risks losing principal) to make the investment. It is important to take risk capacity into consideration when assessing risk tolerance. Example Paul is saving for his retirement in ten years. Achieving a better rate of return on his investments now could mean an earlier retirement date or more money available to him and his wife during retirement. He realizes that a low-risk investment right now will barely keep ahead of the rate of inflation, and he makes the decision to risk investing in a blue-chip Canadian equity fund, rated as medium risk. Therefore, Paul has medium risk tolerance. The fund\u2019s historical rate of return over the preceding ten years is 9%. There is no guarantee that rate of return will continue, and Paul could suffer significant losses if the equity markets have a downturn. However, by holding his savings in a segregated fund he is protected against losses to a maximum of 25% of his investment. Risk capacity is a measure of how much the investor can afford to lose without impacting his objectives or lifestyle. It is an especially important consideration for investors who are approaching retirement or retired. Those who cannot afford losses should restrict investing to the most safe, low risk, guaranteed investments. An investor who can afford to lose principal because he still has earning power will be able to participate in investments with more risk if he has the risk tolerance to do so. An investor may have the capacity for risk but he may not be risk tolerant. Tolerance and capacity are two risk factors that are measured separately from each other; one should not influence an assessment of the other. Example Tim has significant assets: a home valued at $3.3 million, a generous pension based on his executive salary, an RRSP with a balance of over $800,000 and non-registered accounts valued at $2.7 million. Even though Tim has a high capacity for risk because, by any measure, he is a wealthy man, he has low risk tolerance. He invests in low-risk to medium-low risk investments, because he is not comfortable with the idea of losing any of his hard-earned savings. 4.8.4 Investor profile goal \u00b6 The agent should make recommendations to the client in line with the investor profile based on facts and requirements as a result of his analysis.

To create the investor profile, the agent must review: The assets and liabilities of the client to determine his overall financial situation; Personal factors that may affect the client\u2019s investment decisions; Client needs and objectives; Sources of income during retirement; Programs and savings plans that can help the client to save and meet his needs.","title":"4.0 Investor Profile"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_4_Investor_Profile/#41-financial-situation-of-the-investor","text":"Information about assets and liabilities is first gathered so the client\u2019s financial position may be evaluated through a net worth statement and a cash flow statement: The net worth statement lists assets and subtracts liabilities.

Personal assets also include other types of real estate, registered and non-registered investments, pension plan savings, the cash value of life insurance, fine jewelry, art and specialized equipment such as tools or cameras. Assets are important for both their value and the collateral they provide for the purpose of borrowing. Personal assets are listed to see the \u201cplus\u201d side of the net worth statement (also called a balance sheet).

Corporations file separate returns. After the income tax return is filed, the Notice of Assessment (NOA) is issued by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). Taxpayers in Qu\u00e9bec receive a NOA from Revenu Qu\u00e9bec. The key information shown in the personal income tax return is: Amount of taxable income; How that income is earned; Use of tax credits and deductions, including RRSP contributions. The NOA summarizes: Total income; Amount of tax paid; Amount of tax owed; Tax credits received; Deduction room available for an RRSP; Unused net capital losses; Tax-free savings account (TFSA) contributions, withdrawals, and unused contribution room; Other necessary repayments, carry-forwards, and rebate information. Income can be earned from multiple sources in addition to employment. For example, from a personal business, retirement pensions, investments, or spousal support. Dependability of the income is essential to planning. For example, business income could vary year-to-year, but income from a Canada Pension Plan (CPP)/Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP) retirement pension would be stable. From this information, the investor and agent know what can be counted on for income in future years. Contributions made to registered savings plans demonstrate the investor\u2019s current dedication to savings. The deduction limit for RRSPs is calculated based on earned income. It shows whether contributions are currently maximized and is a basis for planning future savings. Tax credits and other deductions reduce income tax: Charitable giving is reflected in the charitable donation credit; The pension income tax credit can demonstrate whether a strategy for splitting retirement income could be implemented since the tax credit must be claimed before income splitting can occur. The taxpayer generally pays tax at his marginal tax rate (MTR), which combines federal and provincial tax rates. The MTR is the rate of income tax applied to the next dollar of income earned. It is important to consider the MTR when choosing investments and planning on using investment income due to its effect on the net amount available for retirement.","title":"4.1.1.1 Income tax return"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_4_Investor_Profile/#4112-registered-retirement-savings-plan-rrsp-statement","text":"The financial institution holding an RRSP issues regular statements; these statements show an account summary.

However, annual contributions to all accounts, including a person\u2019s own RRSP and a spousal RRSP, are limited to the annual maximum, plus the available deduction limit, which includes the carry-forward of unused deductions from former years. An over-contribution of $2,000 over and above this amount is allowed before penalties are incurred. It is very important for an agent to see how the money deposited to the RRSP is invested. This could reveal: Investing expertise and knowledge; The investor\u2019s exposure to risk: Portfolio diversification; and Maturity dates. An account with locked-in funds restricts transfers and withdrawals. The money is locked-in because it has been transferred from a registered pension plan (RPP) or another locked-in account. Locked-in accounts will be addressed later in this chapter. Withdrawals from an RRSP may demonstrate that the investor has had an exceptional expense or has a need to supplement his income. A conversion of the account to a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) or annuity may be advisable if withdrawals seem to occur on a regular basis. The absence of an RRSP statement can also be revealing. It may show the investor does not understand the significance of having an RRSP or does not have funds available for saving in an RRSP. If the RRSP has been closed because the investor has surpassed the age limit for owning an RRSP, statements from other types of registered accounts may be available.

The business owner may not be actively working in the company but still receive a salary or dividends.

When spouses have the same marginal tax rate, income splitting serves no purpose. Income splitting apportions income between spouses so that some income is moved to a spouse who pays tax at a lower marginal tax rate than the other. Therefore, the couple saves money putting income into the hands of a spouse who pays tax at a lower rate. Some examples of effective income splitting include: Opening a spousal or common-law partner RRSP: The higher-income spouse makes payments to the plan for the other spouse. This works for income splitting if the spouse receiving the contributions is in a lower tax bracket than the contributing spouse when withdrawals are made. This is referred to as a spousal or common-law partner plan. Splitting pension income for those 65 and older: Up to 50% of the annual income received from a lifetime annuity, registered pension plan, RRSP annuity, registered retirement income fund (RRIF) or deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP) annuity can be allocated to a spouse. The splitting for tax (SPSP) purposes is done via the tax return. Assigning Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits: CPP can be shared between spouses who were contributors, or between spouses when only one was a contributor. This is called an assignment. Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP) sharing is also available for couples who are married or in a civil union or living in a common-law relationship of at least three years\u2019 duration. Example David receives $18,690 per year as a pension from his former employer. His marginal tax rate is 37%. He could pay as much as $6,915.30 ( $18,690 \u00d7 37%) in income tax on his pension. David\u2019s wife, Beth, has a marginal tax rate of 29%. David splits his pension with Beth, so they each declare $9,345 ( $18,690 \u00f7 2) as income. David\u2019s income tax payable becomes $3,457.65 ( $9,345 \u00d7 37%). Beth\u2019s income tax payable is $2,710.05 ( $9,345 \u00d7 29%). Together they pay $6,167.70 in income tax ( $3,457.65 + $2,710.05), a saving of $747.60 ( $6,915.30 \u2013 $6,167.70) compared to the tax due if David did not split his pension income. There can be an added advantage for the retiree who receives Old Age Security (OAS) pension benefits when income splitting. The OAS pension is completely forfeited by the pensioner when net income reaches a specified level and partly repaid when income exceeds a threshold level.

It is commonly called a \u201ccompany pension\u201d or \u201cprivate pension.\u201d Pension plans can take multiple forms and are funded by companies in both the public and private sector. These pensions are typically called \u201cregistered pension plans\u201d (RPPs). They include: Defined benefit pension plans (DBPPs); Defined contribution pension plans (DCPPs); Pooled registered pension plans (PRPPs). Savings in an RPP are a valuable asset for plan members. However, most Canadian workers are not members of an RPP. Therefore, they must personally fund future retirement costs by saving through other plans (such as an RRSP). All public sector employees are provided with a retirement pension from their employers (i.e., doctors, medical personnel, teachers, members of the police, and emergency services, etc.). Private sector employees may or may not be provided with an employer-provided retirement pension plan. Employees of firms that are federally regulated, such as bank employees, may be members of a pension plan that is registered federally. The plan sponsor (most often the employer) registers and maintains the RPP. A plan administrator is a person or third party that has ultimate responsibility for plan administration, such as enrolling new members, issuing pension statements and keeping records. He must also keep a detailed record if a plan member dies, retires, or terminates the plan. Plan members receive a brochure or booklet explaining the terms of their plan when they join. Vesting is a feature of RPPs that describes who owns the sponsor\u2019s contributions to the employees\u2019 plan when an employee leaves his employer. The employee\u2019s savings always remain his savings; they belong to him. The question arises: What about the money the employer has contributed to the departing employee\u2019s pension? The rules are determined by the pension benefits act of each jurisdiction in which the plan is registered. In the best case, vesting is immediate and the employee receives both his and his employer\u2019s contributions when he leaves. Less favourably, vesting occurs when the employee is required to stay a certain length of time with the employer before he is entitled to both contributions. Least favourably is when vesting is not immediate and the employee retains his pension contributions but does not receive his employer\u2019s contributions. Pension plan contributions, whether made by the employee or the employer, and growth of those contributions due to investment returns are locked-in. Locked-in means that an employee cannot access the value of this RPP until he reaches the retirement age specified in the plan of which he is a member or satisfies the terms of the locked-in account to which he transfers his savings as a result of having changed employer. There are only a few, very specific circumstances, in which the funds can be unlocked. Locking-in refers to the limitations put on the access to the money in an RPP. It applies to: Defined benefit pension plans (DBPPs); Defined contribution pension plans (DCPPs); Pooled registered pension plans (PRPPs). Under particular circumstances, it is possible to unlock the total value of an RPP. These circumstances include cases of financial hardship, shortened life expectancy (usually defined as two years or less) and a very low account balance. There are two phases to locked-in plans: a savings phase and an income phase. Locked-in plans: the savings phase An employee who is leaving a firm but is not retiring has several choices for his locked-in pension. During the savings phase he can: Leave the value of the pension in his former employer\u2019s plan; Transfer the pension value to the RPP of the new employer; Transfer the pension value to a locked-in account at a financial institution; Use the pension value to purchase a deferred life annuity. A person who transfers his pension value to a locked-in account at a financial institution will move his funds to a Locked-in RRSP (also called an LRSP) or locked-in retirement account (LIRA) based on where he resides. The account owner makes the investment decisions for these accounts. The investment types available are the same as those in an RRSP. The main advantages of the locked-in account are that it continues to add investment growth to the contributions in the account. Therefore, savings build, withdrawals are prevented, and tax continues to be deferred. An employee who never changes employers or who leaves contributions with the employer after he has gone to work elsewhere still receives his DBPP pension during retirement. He has no need for transfer options or locked-in accounts. However, an employee with a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) must transfer his contributions at retirement to a locked-in account. RPP contributors cannot access their locked-in plans\u2019 value before the specified retirement age. The plan is locked in to ensure that withdrawals are not made until the retirement age. If funds are not locked-in, withdrawals could be made, and the account value diminished before the beginning of retirement. Locked-in plans: the income phase The savings phase shifts into the income phase when the Locked-in RRSP or LIRA is converted to another form of locked-in plan that is structured to issue payments. This must take place no later than the end of the year in which the plan owner turns 71. Options available for the income phase of the RPP are established at a financial institution. They include the following: Life income fund (LIF); Locked-in retirement income fund (LRIF); Prescribed registered retirement income fund (PRRIF) for those whose plans are registered in Saskatchewan or Manitoba; Restricted life income fund (RLIF) for those with a federally regulated pension. A life annuity may also be acquired from a life insurer by moving funds from the Locked-in RRSP or LIRA. An income stream is created because a minimum annual withdrawal must be taken from the LIF/LRIF/PRRIF/RLIF account and paid to the account owner. Withdrawals can commence at the retirement age set by the terms of the pension plan. There is a limit to the maximum annual withdrawal, except the PRRIF, which has no maximum. The life annuity pays a regular income to its annuitant. An employee may end up with multiple pensions from multiple employers. Example Roger, aged 58, had a defined contribution plan with his employer, in Regina, SK. It vested 14 years ago. Roger is laid off and decides to transfer his pension plan contributions to a LIRA, in which he can make the investment decisions. One year after being laid off, Roger accepts a new job. This employer provides a defined benefit plan pension. Roger joins the plan. On retirement, at age 67, Roger converts his LIRA to a PRRIF. He begins to make regular withdrawals from the PRRIF and receives a monthly pension cheque from his second employer. Contributions to an RPP reduce the RRSP deduction limit for the subsequent year.

A registered retirement income fund (RRIF) is an account that pays an income during retirement from RRSP savings. RRSPs are a voluntary savings program that was introduced to promote saving for retirement through tax incentives. RRSPs are offered by many financial institutions and may hold segregated funds when offered by life insurance companies. An RRSP account owner has responsibility for decisions concerning the investments of his contributions. There are three types of RRSP accounts: RRSP ACCOUNT FEATURES A managed account The investor has a choice of investments that may include Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs), mutual funds, and segregated funds. A self-directed account The investor has a broad choice of investments, including all those available through a managed account plus many others such as stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A fully managed account A professional money manager creates and manages a customized investment portfolio. Fees that can be charged against an RRSP include: RRSP ACCOUNT FEATURES Administrative or trustee fees Cover the financial institution\u2019s cost of looking after the account. Investment fees (depending on the investment) For buying, selling, and switching. Account change fees For closing the account, changing the withdrawal schedule, and/or making a lump-sum withdrawal. A person can own an unlimited number of RRSP accounts. Nevertheless, if accounts are consolidated, each account may charge an administration fee and to eliminate duplicate fees, account owners typically try to limit the number of their RRSP accounts. The maximum annual contribution limit across all accounts cannot be surpassed, regardless of the number of accounts. An RRSP can disclose many of its owner\u2019s characteristics: Investments show risk tolerance; The form of account (managed or self-directed) can indicate investment experience or lack of investment knowledge; Contributions specify dedication to savings and concern for retirement income; Contributions post-retirement indicate unused contribution room is available and, in the absence of contributing income from work, savings are being redirected from non-registered accounts; Contributions to a spousal plan may indicate a need to create a spousal retirement income, and/or a desire to split retirement income and reduce tax. RRSPs offer the following tax benefits: The contribution made to the RRSP can be deducted from income tax and may move the taxpayer into a lower tax bracket, as a result lowering his marginal tax rate; The investment income earned in the account is not taxed until it is withdrawn, leaving a larger sum in the account to invest and grow. Those with RRSP accounts may use the value in their accounts for the Home Buyer\u2019s Plan (HBP) and Lifelong Learning Plan (LLP). Both plans permit the plan owner to make a tax-free withdrawal from the RRSP account. The HBP is used when buying or building a qualifying home for the individual or a related person with a disability. The LLP withdrawal is used to pay the costs of full-time education or training for an adult or his spouse. Both plans restrict the amount that can be withdrawn and state the conditions for use of the funds and repayment.

Have contribution room available from a previous year because the account owner did not make his maximum contribution in that year.

She is able to save about $1,000 per year in her RRSP. She could contribute up to $7,200 per year based on her income ( $40,000 \u00d7 18%). The $6,200 difference ( $7,200 \u2013 $1,000) between her contribution and her contribution limit is not used.

The annual contribution limit is the lesser of: 18% of earned income for the past year; Maximum dollar limit set for the year. Income received from salaries and wages, employment bonuses, alimony, rental income, and business income is earned income. Income received from investments, or pension benefits is not included in earned income.

A one-time over-contribution of $2,000 is also allowed. The over-contribution is not tax-deductible and will grow on a tax-deferred basis. If a plan owner contributes more than $2,000, a 1% penalty tax is applied monthly against the excess contribution. When funds are transferred into an RRSP from a DPSP, GRRSP, or another RRSP, the transfer is not regarded as a contribution.

Contributions are made by one spouse to the other spouse\u2019s plan. The amount that can be contributed is based on the contribution room of the contributor. This reduces his RRSP contribution room.

For example, a RRIF withdrawal is taxed. Its account owner may not need the entire withdrawal for living expenses. If the money is deposited to a non-TFSA and earns investment growth, the account owner will be taxed again on that growth. On the other hand, if the money is deposited to a TFSA, there will be no future tax.","title":"4.7.3 Tax-free savings account (TFSA)"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_4_Investor_Profile/#4731-tfsa-contributions","text":"TFSA Contributions are not tax-deductible. TFSA contributions have a yearly dollar limit. The amount contributed to the TFSA is not based on earned income. A person who does not work and receives money can deposit the money to a TFSA.

The TFSA account offers a broad range of investment options (such as GICs, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and segregated funds). Like an RRSP, contribution room not used is carried forward.

Fund investments plot five measures on the risk scale: low, medium-low, medium, medium-high, and high. An investor will indicate which of those measures matches up with his personal risk tolerance or his agent will guide him to the correct match through a needs\u2019 analysis. Rating risk tolerance requires an agent to take time in client discussions to try and understand investor motivation, fears, and hopes to arrive at an accurate assessment and not rely only on an investor\u2019s self-assessment. Some indicators of risk tolerance are: Account and investment statements indicate investment experience, knowledge, and acceptance of volatility through existing investments; Acceptance of risk is demonstrated in the analysis of personal risks; Accounts in place and their level of funding demonstrate an approach to being risk-ready; Age and circumstances indicate an ability to recover losses. Example Alex believes that he can tolerate some risk in his investments, and when asked by his advisor, Morris, Alex states he has a medium-high risk tolerance. Alex\u2019s interpretation of medium-high means he would accept up to an 8% loss in his invested capital. Morris\u2019s interpretation of medium to high risk tolerance is up to a 15% loss in invested capital. If Morris proceeds to invest Alex\u2019s money on this basis, Alex\u2019s risk tolerance will be exceeded. Alex may result in taking on far more risk than he actually wants. Lifestyle risks are not an indicator of financial risk tolerance. Investors may have differing degrees of risk tolerance for differing investment objectives and time horizons. For example, saving for retirement might have a difference risk tolerance than saving for a holiday. A longer the time horizon might have a higher the tolerance for risk because the more time available for investing the better the probability that invested money will grow and earn a positive return. When time is short, the investor does not have the time to wait for a loss to turn around. Therefore, the risk tolerance is zero or very low. Example Sally and Mark are saving for their retirement, which they now anticipate will happen in three years. When they retire they will be depending on their retirement savings in their RRSPs since neither has a private pension. It is essential that their savings are not diminished and, correspondingly, they do not want to incur investment losses. If they did, they would have to delay retirement because they would need to work longer to make up for those losses. Therefore, they have zero risk tolerance. \u2022 Investors are known to accept or even pursue risk, sometimes at a level unsuitable to their actual tolerance for losses, because higher risk investments may pay better returns than low risk investments. The potentially better return, earned as a higher percentage and/or tax advantage, entices the investor (who risks losing principal) to make the investment. It is important to take risk capacity into consideration when assessing risk tolerance. Example Paul is saving for his retirement in ten years. Achieving a better rate of return on his investments now could mean an earlier retirement date or more money available to him and his wife during retirement. He realizes that a low-risk investment right now will barely keep ahead of the rate of inflation, and he makes the decision to risk investing in a blue-chip Canadian equity fund, rated as medium risk. Therefore, Paul has medium risk tolerance. The fund\u2019s historical rate of return over the preceding ten years is 9%. There is no guarantee that rate of return will continue, and Paul could suffer significant losses if the equity markets have a downturn. However, by holding his savings in a segregated fund he is protected against losses to a maximum of 25% of his investment. Risk capacity is a measure of how much the investor can afford to lose without impacting his objectives or lifestyle. It is an especially important consideration for investors who are approaching retirement or retired. Those who cannot afford losses should restrict investing to the most safe, low risk, guaranteed investments. An investor who can afford to lose principal because he still has earning power will be able to participate in investments with more risk if he has the risk tolerance to do so. An investor may have the capacity for risk but he may not be risk tolerant. Tolerance and capacity are two risk factors that are measured separately from each other; one should not influence an assessment of the other. Example Tim has significant assets: a home valued at $3.3 million, a generous pension based on his executive salary, an RRSP with a balance of over $800,000 and non-registered accounts valued at $2.7 million. Even though Tim has a high capacity for risk because, by any measure, he is a wealthy man, he has low risk tolerance. He invests in low-risk to medium-low risk investments, because he is not comfortable with the idea of losing any of his hard-earned savings.","title":"4.8.3 Determination of risk tolerance"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_4_Investor_Profile/#484-investor-profile-goal","text":"The agent should make recommendations to the client in line with the investor profile based on facts and requirements as a result of his analysis.

These factors can lead the agent to conclude that a segregated fund investment should be recommended for a client with some or all of these characteristics. 5.1.1 Fund analysis \u00b6 Fund recommendation requires the agent to: Stay up-to-date on new fund products; Read industry journals and marketing materials; Seek out the product wholesalers and other investment or product specialists for their input. The agent\u2019s analysis and subsequent recommendation should be completely separate and independent from the commission or trailing fees that the agent would potentially earn. Client suitability must be the only standard used when determining which fund would be most appropriate from the assortment of available funds. All analysis should be based on the most current information, and it should be provided to the client in a timely fashion. Information provided to the client can be fact-based and/or opinion-based. The agent should be clear with the client about which information is factual and which is the agent\u2019s opinion so that the client can make fully informed decisions. 5.1.2 Supporting the segregated fund recommendation \u00b6 The agent must use the client profile to determine which features of the product are of greatest importance to client needs. For example, if the client is most concerned that they will lose capital invested, then the maturity guarantee should be at the top of the agent\u2019s features list. Segregated Funds and Annuity Recommendation The agent must stress to the client the characteristics of the fund that align with the client\u2019s objectives \u2014 but note that the client needs to see the \u201cwhole picture\u201d to understand the choice or choices that are presented. 5.2 Segregated Fund Recommendation \u00b6 The recommendation made to the client must focus on fund specifics. A recommendation will be sound when it is based on information gathered from the client and the needs expressed by the client. Ultimately it is the client who makes the final decision and then once the decision has been made, proceeds with the application. If the client\u2019s decision is contrary to recommendations, the agent should document the client\u2019s reasoning and seek input from their manager about proceeding. If a client returns to the agent in the future for a subsequent investment, that agent must readdress the client\u2019s needs and objectives at that point. An agent must never assume that previously identified needs can be used to support a new recommendation. Instead, each investment must be analyzed separately. Every segregated fund recommendation should consider a set of common elements that are discussed in the following pages. 5.2.1 Identification of fund and its characteristics \u00b6 The recommendation will identify the insurer that provides the fund (e.g., XYZ Life), and how the fund is invested (e.g., in equities, bonds or other). The agent must ensure that the investor understands what they are investing in, how returns in the fund are achieved, and any risks involved. \u201cLike\u201d must be compared to \u201clike\u201d in the recommendation (i.e., a balanced income fund should be compared to another balanced income fund, not to a fund with a different asset allocation). If two different types of funds are recommended (i.e., a balanced income fund and a balanced growth fund) a rationale must be provided for each choice. 5.2.2 Deposit and funding \u00b6 The investor must indicate how much they intend to deposit to the contract and how they propose to fund the contract. A minimum is specified for each fund for lump sum deposits, which include transfers, and for periodic deposits. Some insurers also have a maximum deposit limit. The premium is allocated to fund units at their net asset value (NAV) on the valuation day that applies to the lump sum or periodic deposit. The NAV per unit of a fund forms a benchmark against which future performance is monitored. The following example shows how the same nominal amount of deposit results in the investor receiving a different number of units, depending on the fund\u2019s NAV at the time the deposit is made. Example Lump sum deposit: $10,000 Fund type: Balanced income | RECOMMENDATION | GUARANTEES (MATURITY/DEATH) | NAV PER UNIT | UNITS RECEIVED BY INVESTOR | |----------------|-----------------------------|--------------|---------------------------| | A | 75%/75% | $12.89 | $10,000 \u00f7 $12.89 = 775 units | | B | 75%/75% | $11.16 | $10,000 \u00f7 $11.16 = 896 units | | C | 75%/100% | $11.47 | $10,000 \u00f7 $11.47 = 871 units | Recommendation C has a different guarantee structure and this has to be pointed out to the investor. Note that in the example above, recommendation C has a different guarantee structure than recommendations A and B. This difference must be pointed out to the investor. 5.2.2.1 Lump-sum deposit \u00b6 A lump-sum deposit is a one-time deposit that may or may not be accompanied by subsequent periodic deposits at a later time or times. The deposit sum is in the form of a personal cheque or transfer from another financial institution or pension plan, If there are no subsequent periodic deposits, the maturity guarantee of the contract is based on the single sum deposited. Thus, if the investor has a 10-year time horizon for an investment, it is appropriate to recommend a lump-sum deposit to take full advantage of the guarantee. The investor needs to satisfy the minimum deposit requirement for the fund. 5.2.2.2 Transfers \u00b6 When a deposit to fund the investment will be the result of a transfer of money, the transfer is initiated by the firm that will be receiving the money. Details such as the name of the organization or company from which the money will be transferred, an account number and contact details are needed from the client. If a registered account is the source of transferred money, transferring to another registered account will continue the tax deferral on the invested funds. The transfer of locked-in funds also requires another locked-in account in which the segregated fund investment will be made. Provided that contribution room is available, non-registered funds can be transferred into a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) account or a tax-free savings account (TFSA) and will count as a contribution for the year. If contribution room is exceeded, tax penalties will apply. 5.2.2.3 Periodic deposits \u00b6 Deposits made on an ongoing basis must also meet the minimum requirements of the investment fund. The cash flow statement for the client indicates whether the sum they propose to invest is appropriate and manageable for that client\u2019s situation. Periodic deposits may create a series of maturity guarantees: one guarantee for each deposit or group of deposits. In that case, a series of guarantee dates indicate a series of maturity dates. The agent should take into consideration the time horizon of the client and whether periodic deposits would be suitable for the client. The net asset value per unit of the fund (the price) rises and falls with the markets. As such, each deposit may acquire a different number of units\u2014more when the price falls and less when the price rises. Example Chris has a segregated fund contract set up on the basis of periodic deposits that provides a 75%/75% maturity and death benefit guarantee. At the end of each month for a year, he deposits $250 to the contract. Therefore, each of the 12 deposits is guaranteed at $187.50 ( $250 \u00d7 75%) on each of its 12 maturity dates. Chris\u2019s time horizon should correspond to the series of maturity dates. 5.2.3 Value of guarantees \u00b6 The agent may wish to recommend a suitable maturity guarantee and death benefit guarantee based on what they have learned about the client through the client needs assessment and investor profile process. The guarantee rates offered are either 75% or 100%. If a switch is made from one fund to another during the contract, if the guarantee rate of the new fund differs then the guarantee rate will change to that of the new fund. 5.2.3.1 Maturity guarantee \u00b6 The maturity guarantee is automatically provided in all segregated fund contracts as 75% or 100% of deposits at maturity. It should be reiterated to the client that deposits are guaranteed at maturity, to the percentage selected for maturity guarantees. If the market value of the account is greater than the guarantee due to fund performance, the investor will receive the market value at maturity. If the contract is surrendered before the maturity date, then the investor loses the benefit of the maturity guarantee. If withdrawals are made, the guarantee will be adjusted. The percentage of guarantee (i.e., 75%) after a withdrawal is based on the new, lower balance. The agent who recommends a fund with one guarantee or the other has to be able to substantiate the decision in their analysis by comparing the effect of a lower or higher MER, in addition to other fund attributes. The agent will also want to stress to the investor that some funds have higher potential for growth than others based on the fund\u2019s risk level. An assessment of the fund\u2019s risk is detailed in the information folder and Fund Facts for each fund. 5.2.3.2 Death benefit guarantee \u00b6 Just like the maturity guarantee, the death benefit guarantee is an automatic part of the contract (75% or 100% depending on the terms of the fund). The guarantee may be reassuring to those whose health is impaired at the time the contract is taken out, or to those who are older. 5.2.4 Contract maturity date \u00b6 The minimum maturity date is 10 years from the deposit date. The client should be informed of the maturity date in actual time (i.e., the month, day, and year for maturity based on the date the deposit is made). The client should also be shown the relationship between a higher guarantee or guarantees and an extended maturity date as some segregated funds that offer 100% guarantees require a 15-year period to maturity. 5.2.5 Principal risks of segregated funds \u00b6 Risks of a segregated fund are rated as very low, low, low to moderate, moderate, moderate to high, and high. This rating is based on historical volatility of a fund. The level of risk of a fund depends on its underlying investments. The greater the potential return, the greater the risk and vice versa. Fund risk varies over time due to changes in interest rates, economic conditions, and investment market conditions. Funds are also subject to specific risks, based on their type. For example, bonds have high interest rate risk, but low market risk, whereas an equity fund (stocks) have higher market risk and equity risk and low interest rate risk. When preparing and giving a recommendation, it is important for the agent to consider: The risk rating of each recommended fund; The forms of risk associated with the fund (e.g., equity risk and inflation risk); The risk tolerance of the investor. 5.2.6 Reset \u00b6 Usually once per year, investors can lock-in increases in the market value of their investment through the reset feature. Not all segregated funds offer resets. Funds that offer a reset feature may have a higher management expense ratio (MER). When making a recommendation that includes a fund that provides reset and one that does not, must show the \u201ccost\u201d of reset. Other aspects of reset that need to be compared between recommendations include: The number of resets permitted in a year; Whether reset is automatic or only on client instruction; How reset affects the maturity date, maturity guarantee, and the death benefit guarantee. Example Nassir\u2019s agent, Farah, recommends a segregated fund contract that will have a 10-year maturity date from April 23, 2020. Nassir has a $5,000 premium available and wants a 75%/75% guarantee structure. The average rate of return on the recommended fund is 5.02% annually over the past 10 years. The maturity date of his contract will be April 23, 2030 \u2013 one month after his 65 th birthday. Example (Cont.) The cash paid out then will help him delay both his Canada Pension Plan (CPP) (or Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan \u2013 QPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) benefits, to receive the deferral \u201cbonus\u201d on both. The contract would have an automatic reset every two years on its anniversary date. The first reset would be April 23, 2022. This locks in growth; however, the maturity date of the contract would advance to April 23, 2032. Based on this addition of two years to the initial maturity date, Nassir will have to begin his government retirement benefits sooner. This means they will be paid at a lower rate. Considering that resets will be automatic, Nassir and Farah should estimate before he enters into the contract whether he is better to take the resets and extend the contract or consider another fund with a 10-year term-to-maturity for which resets are voluntary rather than automatic. 5.2.7 Contract riders \u00b6 An agent should address whether a rider is needed as part of the recommendation made to the client. Where a rider is recommended, the characteristics of the rider should be thoroughly described. Riders are not widely available, so comparisons between providers or products may be difficult to make, which should be pointed to the investor. 5.2.8 Fund taxation \u00b6 Taxation depends on whether the contract is set up as a registered or non-registered account. Taxation rules are based upon income tax legislation. General rules to remember: Deposits to a registered contract are counted as a contribution if the contract is an RRSP or TFSA; RRSP contributions are tax-deductible; Taxable allocations of the returns generated by the fund will be declared and will increase the adjusted cost base (ACB) when the account is not a registered account; Withdrawals are taxed very differently depending on whether the account is registered or not. In the recommendation, the agent should: Point out to the client the primary form of returns that are expected to be earned by the investment (i.e., interest); Compare the tax advantages of receiving allocations of capital gains or dividends over interest when the account is not registered. 5.2.9 Fund sales charge \u00b6 The sales charge (or load) is paid by the investor. There are three types of sales charge: No load\u2014no sales charge; A front-end load (FEL)\u2014It is charged once at the time the investment is placed and reduces the sum being invested; A deferred sales charge (DSC)\u2014it is charged to every withdrawal according to the DSC schedule for the fund. The DSC schedule is a decreasing percentage scale. The agent can calculate the amount of the sales charge of a front-load fund for the investor and can illustrate the estimated DSC in dollar terms on a potential withdrawal amount and the fair market value of the fund. The sales charge fee is a commission that the agent receives. The agent must make recommendations within the best set of characteristics based on the investor profile and not the anticipated commission. Example 1 Mark proposes to invest $10,000 in the segregated fund recommended by his agent. It has a 5% front-end sales load. Mark\u2019s investment is reduced by $500 ( $10,000 \u00d7 5%) so that his initial investment becomes $9,500. Example 2 Allison has invested in a segregated fund that provides the following DSC: LENGTH OF TIME AFTER PREMIUM IS PAID CHARGE FOR WITHDRAWAL OR SURRENDER Within year 1 4.5% Within year 2 4.0% Within year 3 3.5% Within year 4 3.0% Within year 5 2.5% Within year 6 2.0% After year 7 0.0% Scenario 1 In year 5 of the contract, Allison wishes to redeem a sufficient amount of units to receive a net amount of $25,000. Therefore, she makes a withdrawal on the following basis. Since the withdrawal in year 5 is subject to a DSC of 2.5%, Allison will receive only 97.5% (100% \u2013 2.5%) of units redeemed. If she wishes to obtain $25,000, she must, therefore, redeem units in the amount of $25,641 ( $25,000 \u00f7 97.5%). Accordingly, 2.5% of $25,641 represents $641 of fees and the balance ( $25,641 \u2013 $641 = $25,000) is the amount Allison wants to receive. On the other hand, if she wished to withdraw $25,000 from the account value, the amount received would be reduced to $24,375 by the 2.5% DSC ( $25,000 \u2013 $625 (2.5%) = $24 375). Scenario 2 In year 5 of the contract, Allison must surrender her segregated fund due to an unexpected change in her financial situation. The market value of her investment is $122,900. 5.2.10 Fund management expense ratio (MER) \u00b6 The management expense ratio (MER) of a fund is the percentage of management and operating expenses relative to the average value of each fund\u2019s assets. The MER is charged regardless of fund performance. Trailing commissions are paid to the agent from the management fee and are one of the components that make up the MER. The MER and amount charged as trailing commission are clearly disclosed in the Fund Facts for each fund. While fund performance is reported net of MER (i.e., a reported return of 4.2% and an MER of 2.8%, the real return on the fund is 7.0%\u2014the investor earns 4.2%), MERs vary between funds and reduce the return on investment. The higher the MER, the greater the reduction in return to the investor. MER should not form the basis of an investment recommendation as a fund with a higher MER may perform better than a fund with a lower MER, and despite the higher MER can generate a higher return than the fund with the lower MER. Example Roberta has invested $10,000 in Fund A with an MER of 3.5% and $10,000 in Fund B with an MER of 1.5%. Both funds have a reported 5.0% rate of return. Fund A : The real rate of return, before MER, is 8.5% (5.0% + 3.5%). The fund manager earns 8.5%, keeps 3.5%, and pays Roberta 5.0%. Fund B : The real rate of return, before MER, is 6.5% (5.0% + 1.5%). The fund manager earns 6.5%, keeps 1.5%, and pays Roberta 5.0%. If instead of a 5% return, Fund A has a reported return of 6.2%, the real rate of return is 9.7% (6.2% + 3.5%). The fund manager earns 9.7%, keeps 3.5%, and pays Roberta 6.2%. 5.2.11 Fund details \u00b6 The agent is responsible for discussing and explaining the contents as contained in the information folder and Fund Facts of each fund, to the investor. Fund Facts are particularly useful because their information facilitates comparison between funds; they are brief summaries of the many details relevant to each fund. 5.2.11.1 Delivery of Fund Facts \u00b6 Fund Facts are part of the information folder and are delivered (in person, electronically via email, or through an online site) to a prospective investor before the application for the contract is signed. Providing the Fund Facts is mandatory as part of the disclosure process that accompanies a sale. The client must acknowledge either in writing or in conversation with the agent that they have received the information folder. 5.2.11.2 Delivery of financial statements \u00b6 The financial statements show selected financial information about a fund. They are not provided with the information folder. Clients may submit their request for financial statements to the agent or directly to the insurer providing the fund. All funds release annual audited financial statements and semi-annual unaudited financial statements. 5.2.11.3 Total value of fund \u00b6 This dollar figure, shown in the Fund Facts for the fund, reveals how much is invested in the fund. The total value of the fund is relevant because it is the figure on which the MER is based. Funds with a higher total value can potentially offer a lower MER, which benefits the investor as the MER erodes returns. 5.2.11.4 Fund units, net asset value per unit and market value \u00b6 The number of units outstanding and the net asset value per unit are shown in the Fund Facts at the date specified. The market value of units will be the current value, or value as of the most recent valuation date. This data is used for comparison purposes and is not an indication of the quality of the investment. Over its lifetime, a segregated fund may (resulting in no change in market value) be: Divided - in which case unit values will decrease; or Consolidated - in which case unit values will increase. 5.2.11.5 Date of inception \u00b6 This is the date on which the fund began operations. Funds with longer histories have experienced various market conditions and have more reliable performance data. A client with a lower risk tolerance may appreciate a recommendation that includes a fund with a longer record since they may see historical lows and highs in addition to typical results. 5.2.11.6 Performance data \u00b6 Performance data is always historical only showing performance results over a specified past period of time. It may be useful to compare funds, but must never be used to predict what will happen in the future. Performance is stated as an average return and year-by-year return. The average return states how much a $1,000 investment with the most basic guarantee (75% maturity/75% death benefit) would be worth and its average annual return as a percentage for the years shown. Year-by-year returns show the fund\u2019s annual performance in a chart format. They also state the number of years of positive performance and negative performance. Where a segregated fund invests in real estate, the purchase and sale of real estate in the fund is described for the previous five years. Funds with a history of less than one year do not report performance data. 5.2.11.7 Fund manager \u00b6 Performance can be attributed to the manager of the fund. The fund manager appears on the Fund Facts, but the document does not show how long the same manager has been in place. If a fund has displayed strong performance over a long period but the fund manager is new, investors should question whether the strong performance will continue. Fund managers are regularly reviewed and can be changed if they do not meet expectations of the insurer. 5.2.11.8 Portfolio turnover rate \u00b6 The portfolio turnover rate is expressed as a percentage of the fund\u2019s holdings that have been replaced during the previous year. The turnover rate impacts the MER with high turnover translating into higher expenses due to the costs of buying and selling. A low turnover indicates a buy-and-hold investment philosophy, and correspondingly lower costs for trading. A lower MER can improve investor returns. 5.2.12 Fund penalties \u00b6 Regardless of which segregated fund or funds are recommended and subsequently selected for investment, the client should be reminded of the long-term nature of the investment. Early withdrawal from a fund or switching between funds may incur fund penalties. Such penalties should be pointed out to the client and reference made to how they will be calculated. Some charges or penalties include: Account closing charge; Frequent switching charge; Fees to set up registered accounts; Short-term trading fee; Unscheduled withdrawal or switch fee. 5.3 Finding for an Annuity \u00b6 An investor seeking income is a likely candidate for a payout annuity. Those looking for a very conservative non-income paying investment without the limitations of segregated funds, such as the 10-year term-to-maturity period, sales charged and annual MER) may be potential candidates for an accumulation annuity. As with segregated funds, the agent must satisfy the principle of suitability for annuities. The agent must analyze benefits and limitations of an annuity investment given the client\u2019s needs and make a thorough comparison of annuities suitable to the client\u2019s needs. The agent must have documentation to support the recommendation and be able to show that alternative investments were considered and presented, in case the agent\u2019s recommendation is ever questioned in the future. 5.3.1 Annuity analysis \u00b6 The following questions, as discussed in Chapter 3, should be addressed in assessing an annuity to understand its features, benefits, and limitations: Is the annuity being created for income or savings? How many lives will be covered? Will the annuity payments be made for a specific period or life? When will income begin? Will income be a level payment or variable? How will the contract be funded? Which form of taxation will apply? To assess and recommend an annuity, the following questions must be answered: Does the client need income or savings? Is it sufficient for the client to be covered or should it be the client and their spouse? Is the income need temporary or lifelong? When does the client need income to begin? Does the client need level income that they can count on or is variable income better? How will the client fund the contract? What will be the tax impact on the client? The agent has many products to analyze to find appropriate answers to these questions and form a suitable recommendation for the client. It may not be possible to arrive at a recommendation that ticks all boxes on the client's list of needs and circumstances. In this situation, the agent can proceed with the best available recommendation while pointing out its advantages and its shortfalls, even if it may lead to the loss of a sale. 5.3.1.1 Current offerings \u00b6 The agent needs to keep apprised of new product introductions and innovations. It is never appropriate to rely on former decisions or only on knowledge of long-standing products. Every decision should be based on a review of what is currently available, which will include the new and old. 5.3.2 Supporting the annuity recommendation \u00b6 An agent may find that the characteristics of annuities make them the preferred choice for the investment based on the client\u2019s investor profile. For example, if income is a priority, then an annuity may be the best solution to provide the required income. It may also be suitable to acquire both a segregated fund to protect some of the investor\u2019s capital while enabling growth and an annuity for its income stream. An agent must have a sound basis for an annuity recommendation that is a result of client needs weighed against product features. Limitations need to be reviewed as well as alternatives. All factors relevant to the decision should be presented so the client understands the reasons why the annuity is the best investment option to meet the required objectives. 5.4 Annuity Recommendation \u00b6 In addition to determining the type of annuity best suited to the client: payout or accumulation, the agent and client must determine how the deposit will be made, when payments will begin, the payment schedule, whether payments will be level or variable, and the guarantee period best suited to manage the risk of the investment. Every annuity recommendation should include the following elements: Type of annuity and its characteristics; Timing of payments; Annuity rate; Value of guarantees; Principal risks of annuity recommendations; Annuity. 5.4.1 Type of annuity and its characteristics \u00b6 There are two fundamental types of annuities: payout or accumulation. A payout annuity is recommended when the client\u2019s main need is for income. The agent must also recommend how long the income should be paid over a choice of term periods\u201410 years, 20 years, to a specified age, or for life. Life requires a recommendation of a personal contract when the lifelong income is for the client alone or a joint and last survivor contract when the income is for the client and their spouse. A payout annuity may qualify as a prescribed annuity for tax purposes, whereby the same amount of interest and capital is presumably received by the annuitant with every payment. A prescribed annuity is generally preferable to an annuity taxed by the accrual method. Agents should consider structuring an annuity so that it will qualify as a prescribed annuity. An accumulation annuity is recommended when the analysis indicates the investor\u2019s objective is an investment return (not income). The agent has to be aware of requirements for payout annuities funded by a transfer from a registered or locked-in account, such as age limits and minimum withdrawals. The agent also recommends suitable investments to be held within the annuity, based on the time horizon and risk tolerance of the investor. 5.4.1.1 Minimum and maximum investment \u00b6 A minimum investment for each type of annuity is stated by the insurer offering the product; a recommendation cannot be based on less than this amount. A maximum may also be specified by the insurer. 5.4.1.2 Maturity date \u00b6 A maturity date applies to both a term annuity and an accumulation annuity. Determining the length of time until the maturity date depends on the income need to be satisfied by the term annuity, and the time horizon for the accumulation annuity. If the accumulation annuity is not being used to save for a specific event and therefore does not have a time horizon, the agent determines the reason for acquiring the annuity and matches a maturity date accordingly. Where a higher payment of income is needed, a shorter term-to-maturity for the term annuity should be recommended since payments will be higher when they are made over a shorter period. If the need is to create a stop-gap source of income (also called income bridging) for those who have stopped working and are not yet entitled to full retirement benefits, then the length of the term annuity should be aligned with the period of time between when the individual stops work and starts receiving his pension. Example Jane has been employed as a senior executive at a manufacturing firm for 19 years. At age 60, she is given a \u201cpackage\u201d from her employer that consists of a lump sum equal to 5 years\u2019 salary providing she leaves the company immediately. She has a pension with her employer in which retirement benefits are available at age 65. Jane accepts the package and uses the lump sum to purchase a five-year immediate term annuity. About the time her annuity payments end, her retirement pension begins so her income remains constant from the time employment ends and retirement begins. 5.4.2 Timing of payments \u00b6 Payments from a payout annuity may be recommended to begin immediately (for an \u201cimmediate annuity\u201d) or at a later date (for a \u201cdeferred annuity\u201d), based on the client\u2019s need for income. 5.4.2.1 Immediate payments \u00b6 An immediate annuity, in which payments begin on the next scheduled payment date, could be recommended to an investor who has funds available to deposit now and an immediate need for an income stream. If an RRSP is being converted at maturity into an annuity, annuity payments must begin in the year following the year in which the conversion is made, at the latest. The payments cannot be deferred to a later date. 5.4.2.2 Deferred payments \u00b6 Deferred payments are suitable for an investor who wants to accumulate deposits in the contract before receiving income or who wishes income to begin at a future date. 5.4.3 Annuity rate \u00b6 The annuity rate offered by the insurer for the recommended annuity will be in force for the duration of the annuity once the contract is finalized (for an immediate annuity) or once payments begin (for a deferred annuity). Annuity rates vary among insurers. Agents who have the ability to \u201cshop around\u201d for the best rates can incorporate those rates in their recommendation. Annuity rates used by insurers are different for fixed-income annuities and variable income annuities. 5.4.3.1 Fixed-income annuity \u00b6 A fixed-income annuity, in which each payment is equal, provides income security for the annuity. It is best suited to an investor without the risk tolerance for a variable income. 5.4.3.2 Variable income annuity \u00b6 With a variable income annuity, payments will rise with rising markets and fall in declining markets. A variable income annuity may be suitable for an investor who has the risk tolerance for the ups-and-downs of the stock and bond markets. A recommendation for a variable income annuity should take the age of the investor into account since losses incurred at an older age are more difficult to make up than when a person is younger. An indexed annuity sees payments increase based on the schedule provided in the contract, typically in step with increases in the cost of living. There is a significant price premium for adding the indexing feature when purchasing an annuity over a longer term and a recommendation would properly show the cost for an annuity that is not indexed in addition to the indexed annuity. 5.4.4 Value of guarantees \u00b6 Guarantees customize an annuity contract to suit the needs of the policy owner. They increase the cost of the annuity for the policy owner and consequently decrease the amount the annuitant receives in annuity payments. They provide the policyholder with the assurance that a minimum amount will be paid to the beneficiary in the event the annuitant dies before the end of the guaranteed payment period. 5.4.4.1 Life annuity guarantees \u00b6 The guarantee period of a life annuity assures the investor that, if the annuitant dies during the guarantee period, a sum representing the balance of the guarantee will be paid to a beneficiary. Therefore, the guarantee ensures a minimum return on the investment. Risk tolerance can be addressed by the guarantee period: For low risk tolerance use a longer guarantee period\u2014this results in a lower payment to the annuitant; For higher risk tolerance use a shorter guarantee period\u2014this results in higher payments to the annuitant. The length of the guarantee period could affect the likelihood of the beneficiary receiving a payment when the annuitant dies. However, this should not be a primary concern as the need of the annuitant for income should always be considered before the beneficiary\u2019s inheriting the residual proceeds. Age of the investor must also be considered when determining the appropriate length of the guarantee period. Recommending a 20-year guarantee period for a life annuity acquired at age 80 may be overly expensive\u2014and optimistic. 5.4.4.2 Return of premium guarantee \u00b6 A return of premium rider added to the contract pays the beneficiary the full deposit to the contract if the annuitant dies before the first payment. The rider is appropriate for those who have a low risk tolerance, for when a deferred annuity is recommended, when the annuitant is in poor health, or to ensure return of principal invested to the estate. 5.4.5 Principal risks of annuity recommendation \u00b6 The principal risk of an annuity recommendation is an annuity rate that improves in the future, due to an increase in interest rates. The higher rate will be unavailable to annuitants whose contracts are already set and, therefore, they will earn less than they would have received if they had had the higher rate. This risk can be managed by recommending that a series of annuity contracts be acquired over a period of several years, thereby \u201claddering\u201d the sum available for investment and the income received. Inflation risk is another significant risk to annuity investors. Inflation risk can be managed by using an indexed annuity; the investor must decide whether its additional cost is worthwhile. With annuities that allow little or no flexibility, the investor also risks the loss of control over their capital. The risk is counterbalanced by the security of an income stream. 5.4.6 Annuity penalties \u00b6 An annuity is a contractual commitment, for a period of time or for life. While some annuities may permit a withdrawal or surrender, others do not. Payout annuities cannot be surrendered and have almost no flexibility\u2014except a term certain annuity which may be surrendered upon approval of the issuer. Accumulation annuities are generally redeemable, although penalties may apply. The recommendation must emphasize the commitment made by the investor and the guarantee made by the insurer to the investor.","title":"Chapter 5 Segregated Funds and Annuity"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_5_Segregated_Funds_and_Annuity/#chapter-5-segregated-funds-and-annuity","text":"","title":"Chapter 5: Segregated Funds and Annuity"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_5_Segregated_Funds_and_Annuity/#51-finding-a-segregated-fund","text":"When the needs analysis is completed, the agent may find: The client wants an investment with the benefits of an insurance contract; The client wants to tap into the performance of the capital markets; The client needs indicate a long-term investment is most suitable; The client is not seeking a regular income from this investment, either now or in the near future; or Guarantees appeal to the investor\u2019s risk tolerance.

If the client\u2019s decision is contrary to recommendations, the agent should document the client\u2019s reasoning and seek input from their manager about proceeding. If a client returns to the agent in the future for a subsequent investment, that agent must readdress the client\u2019s needs and objectives at that point.

Based on this addition of two years to the initial maturity date, Nassir will have to begin his government retirement benefits sooner. This means they will be paid at a lower rate.

The DSC schedule is a decreasing percentage scale. The agent can calculate the amount of the sales charge of a front-load fund for the investor and can illustrate the estimated DSC in dollar terms on a potential withdrawal amount and the fair market value of the fund. The sales charge fee is a commission that the agent receives. The agent must make recommendations within the best set of characteristics based on the investor profile and not the anticipated commission. Example 1 Mark proposes to invest $10,000 in the segregated fund recommended by his agent. It has a 5% front-end sales load. Mark\u2019s investment is reduced by $500 ( $10,000 \u00d7 5%) so that his initial investment becomes $9,500.

Therefore, she makes a withdrawal on the following basis. Since the withdrawal in year 5 is subject to a DSC of 2.5%, Allison will receive only 97.5% (100% \u2013 2.5%) of units redeemed. If she wishes to obtain $25,000, she must, therefore, redeem units in the amount of $25,641 ( $25,000 \u00f7 97.5%). Accordingly, 2.5% of $25,641 represents $641 of fees and the balance ( $25,641 \u2013 $641 = $25,000) is the amount Allison wants to receive. On the other hand, if she wished to withdraw $25,000 from the account value, the amount received would be reduced to $24,375 by the 2.5% DSC ( $25,000 \u2013 $625 (2.5%) = $24 375).

A payout annuity may qualify as a prescribed annuity for tax purposes, whereby the same amount of interest and capital is presumably received by the annuitant with every payment. A prescribed annuity is generally preferable to an annuity taxed by the accrual method. Agents should consider structuring an annuity so that it will qualify as a prescribed annuity. An accumulation annuity is recommended when the analysis indicates the investor\u2019s objective is an investment return (not income).

If the need is to create a stop-gap source of income (also called income bridging) for those who have stopped working and are not yet entitled to full retirement benefits, then the length of the term annuity should be aligned with the period of time between when the individual stops work and starts receiving his pension.

The contract between an insurer and an investor for a segregated fund is an individual variable insurance contract (IVIC). 6.1.1 Individual variable insurance contract (IVIC) \u00b6 The IVIC spells out how to buy, terminate, withdraw, and receive the benefits from the segregated fund investment. It is intended to reveal what the investor is buying and reinforce the risk associated with the investment. The risk of investing is disclosed on the face page, or cover, of the contract with wording to the effect of \u201cThe contract holder assumes the risk of investment and any amount allocated to a segregated fund may increase or decrease in value.\u201d The insurer makes these commitments to the investor: Guarantees and benefits; How to determine the value of benefits related to the market value of the fund and their surrender value; Percentage of premium allocated to provide the benefits related to the market value of the fund; When the value of the fund and benefits are determined; Fees and charges, or how fees and charges are calculated; Right to make changes to the contract. The contract states what information forms part of the contract. It includes: Identification of the IVIC and the segregated fund; Management expense ratio (MER); Risk disclosure; Fees and expenses; Right to cancel; Statement of the accuracy of the Fund Facts information and the remedy for any error in the information provided by that document. Finally, the contract states: The contract may be rescinded in writing to the insurance company, at the address it has specified, within two business days after the contract owner receives confirmation of the purchase; If the contract is rescinded, the contract owner receives the lesser of the amount invested or the value of the fund on the valuation day following the day the insurer received the request for rescission. Fees or charges are also refunded; The contract owner is deemed to receive a confirmation five business days after it has been mailed by the insurer. A contract may be attached to the application form or may be provided to the investor after the insurer receives the application. The purchase is confirmed by the effective date of the contract. The effective date is the valuation date following the receipt of the first deposit and when all contract criteria have been satisfied. The contract is assigned a unique reference number. This number is used whenever instructions about the contract are conveyed between contract owner and insurer. 6.2 Investor Requirements \u00b6 The investor must provide the information needed for the contract to be prepared and help to fill out the application. He must be accurate and truthful. The agent proceeds on the basis that the investor understands the decision he is making and can appreciate its consequences. If the agent is unsure of the client\u2019s ability to understand any part of the contract, the agent should seek advice from his supervisor before proceeding. The investor must also fund the account. 6.2.1 Application form \u00b6 The application form is completed by the investor and the agent together. The investor, who is the applicant, provides the necessary information; the agent records the information on the form itself in its electronic or paper format. All information must be recorded correctly and completely. The agent may need to explain certain aspects of the form so the investor fully understands his options and his commitment. If it appears that the investor does not fully understand an application or any part of the application, the application should not be completed. The investor must review all information on the form and correct any inaccuracies. Then, the investor and annuitant, if they are not the same person, both sign and date the application. Their signatures confirm their agreement with the information. The agent must also provide specific information for the application to be processed. An exception is made to the requirement for the contract owner to sign the application when the contract owner is represented by a power of attorney (POA) for property. An agent may find a POA appointed for a client who is ill, mentally incapable or absent from the country for a prolonged period of time. The individual with the POA can complete and sign the application on behalf of the contract owner. However, he may not have rights to name the beneficiary. A legal opinion should be sought in this circumstance. Information must be recorded by the agent carefully since it will become the basis for the contract. An incomplete application will be rejected by the insurer. At the time the application is made, the reason-why letter is prepared. The reason-why letter is one of the pillars of insurances sales suitability. It proves that the agent has addressed a relevant insurance need or needs by making recommendations to a client, together with the basis for the recommendations, and whether or not the client has accepted or refused those recommendations. The reason-why letter: Confirms facts; Verifies the instructions received from the client; Identifies the client's needs that the product meets and the needs that will be left uninsured; Documents that the sale is suitable; Substantiates the client\u2019s understanding of his purchase. The reason-why letter is not optional. The agent must prepare the letter and review it with the client, and both must keep a copy. 6.2.1.1 Registered or non-registered form \u00b6 A segregated fund account can be non-registered or registered. Registered accounts are further categorized as locked-in or non-locked-in. There may be age restrictions at which certain types of locked-in accounts can be established; however, there are no age restrictions for opening a non-registered account. Select the account in which the IVIC investment is made carefully. For example, an investor who wants the tax deferral of a registered account may be financially disadvantaged if the account is set up in a non-registered form. A registered account has specific requirements and limitations: The contract owner must provide his Social Insurance Number (SIN) for tax purposes; The owner must be the same person as the annuitant; Ownership cannot be transferred; The contract cannot be used as collateral. A non-registered account allows: An annuitant who is not the contract owner; An owner to be an individual, a group of individuals, or a corporation; The contract to be purchased until the date on which the annuitant turns 90; Ownership to be transferred; The account to be used as collateral for securing a loan by assigning the contract to the lender. 6.2.1.2 Naming annuitant and beneficiary \u00b6 The owner of the contract enjoys the rights of ownership, such as the ability to assign the contract. He names the annuitant and beneficiary to the contract. The annuitant is the person on whose life the guarantees are based and whose death triggers payment of the death benefit. Once named, the annuitant may not be changed. However, in a non-registered contract, prior to the death of the initial annuitant, a joint annuitant may be named to replace him if he dies. The contract continues until the death of the last surviving annuitant, and the death benefit is only paid out at this time. The beneficiary receives the benefit of the contract after the death of the last surviving annuitant. More than one beneficiary can be named. If this occurs, a percentage of death benefit must be allotted to each beneficiary. When a spousal RRSP is set up, the owner and annuitant of the contract is the person who receives the deposits. The person who made the deposits to the plan does not have ownership rights. The recipient of the deposits (as owner) names the beneficiary. After a contract owner has died, the insurer may release information about a contract to the beneficiary and the owner\u2019s estate. Example Jill sets up a spousal RRSP in the name of her husband, Jack, and makes contributions to it. Jack is the owner and annuitant of the plan, and he alone can name its beneficiary. 6.2.1.3 Rider election form \u00b6 The rider election is provided only to those contract owners investing in guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB). It: Provides a payment option (lifetime or to an end-date); Offers space to fill in the correct fund codes (must be those that offer the rider); Describes minimum initial deposit requirements; Gives a choice of payments; Instructs on the frequency of payments and how they are made; Establishes mandatory authorization by the owner and the agent. The rider addresses the impact of excess withdrawals from a GMWB because they can significantly reduce the value of the contract. 6.2.1.4 Client identification requirements \u00b6 The agent has obligations under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) to: Identify clients; Report attempted or completed suspicious transactions; Keep records about the client and the transaction if the client is expected to deposit $10,000 or more to the contract over its lifetime. Determine if the client is acting on instructions from a third party. These requirements do not apply when the account is registered. Requirements are also specified for the agent if a large cash transaction is made. A large cash transaction is a single cash deposit of $10,000 or more, or multiple cash deposits equaling $10,000 or more made in a 24-hour period. When an account is opened, reviewed, or a suspicious fact is detected, the agent has to confirm whether the client is a politically exposed foreign person (PEFP), a domestic politically exposed person (PEP), head of an international organization (HIO) or a family member or close associate of one of these people. A PEFP is a person who has held a government or judicial position in a foreign country. A domestic PEP is a person who holds \u2014 or has held within the last five years \u2014 a specific office or position in or on behalf of the Canadian federal government, a Canadian provincial government, or a Canadian municipal government. An HIO is the head or chief executive officer of an international organization set up by the governments of more than one country. If the client is identified as being high risk, you have specific obligations for the client, his family members, and close associates that apply to record keeping, establishing the source of funds, and obtaining the approval of senior management to keep the account owner. FINTRAC has three methods to obtain suitable client identification: Photo identification; A credit file; and Dual process: two original, valid and current documents or information from independent and reliable sources must be provided. Corporations and other entities must also supply acceptable identification, such as the corporation\u2019s certificate of corporate status, and the names of directors. The agent must be completely confident that the person appearing in the identification papers is the same person making the application. If there is any suspicion that the applicant is acting for a third party, then a form for third party determination must be completed. Any suspicious transaction or attempted transaction may be of interest to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC). Suspicious transactions are a combination of facts, context and money-laundering indicators. Facts are actual events, actions, occurrences or elements that exist or are known to have happened. Context is provided through general awareness of events in the client\u2019s business or community, knowledge of typical financial activities, regular know-your-client activities, information based on risk assessments and the background and/or behaviour of a client. Indicators are potential red flags that could initiate suspicion or indicate that something may be unusual without a reasonable explanation. Suspicion itself has three thresholds. The lowest is simple suspicion in which a hunch or gut feeling leads an agent to believe that money laundering or terrorist financing is happening. Next is when there are reasonable grounds to suspect that there is a possibility of money laundering or terrorist financing. The highest threshold is when there are reasonable grounds to believe and support the possibility that money laundering or terrorist financing is occurring. An attempted or completed suspicious transaction must be reported to FINTRAC. The agent may wish to first bring the situation to the attention of a supervisor or manager. All members of the financial services industry have a responsibility to follow the FINTRAC guidelines in an effort to curtail, with a goal of eliminating, money laundering and terrorist financing. 6.2.2 Funding the account \u00b6 A deposit must accompany the application. It can be in the form of: A cheque made payable to the insurer for a lump sum; A transfer from another account; or By agreement for pre-authorized deposits. Pre-authorized deposits or debits (PADs) specify the frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually), the date of the first withdrawal from the account and the regular subsequent date for withdrawals. Banking information for the institution from which withdrawals will be made and a personalized void cheque or stamped confirmation from the bank must be provided. The deposit is allocated to the selected fund or funds. If more than one fund is chosen, the contract owner also indicates either the dollar amount of or percentage of deposit he wants to be applied to each fund. In some jurisdictions, when locked-in funds representing contributions to a registered pension plan are being transferred, the spouse must give consent to the purchase of the investment. The spouse has the option to release his rights to the pension contributions by providing a written waiver form. An RRSP, locked-in retirement account (LIRA, also called an LRSP, or locked-in retirement savings plan) contract can accept deposits until the end of the calendar year in which the contract owner turns 71. To continue tax deferral, the following conversions can be made: An RRSP to a RRIF; A LIRA/LRSP to a life income fund (LIF) or life retirement income fund (LRIF); In Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the LIRA/LRSP to a prescribed registered retirement income fund (PRRIF). If an account must be transferred from one form to another due to attained age, the insurer handles the change. The contract owner is set up with the proper account and the same fund. There may be a minimum value required to open an account and for different forms of account. The investor is informed of the unit value for each deposit. The unit value of the fund forms a benchmark against which the future performance is monitored. 6.3 Agent Requirements \u00b6 The agent is required to meet expectations of the client and the insurer he represents for pre-sale activities, completion of the application, delivery of documents and post-sale service. 6.3.1 Meeting carrier expectations \u00b6 The agent is expected to meet all expectations of the carrier for the volume of business, client contact, accuracy, and necessary record keeping. 6.3.2 Document delivery \u00b6 The contract must be delivered to the investor in person or through registered mail for the purchase to be completed and the contract issued. It includes other specified documents like the information folder, Fund Facts, and contract confirmation. If a delivery receipt is part of the package of documents, it must be completed, signed, and witnessed before it is returned to the issuing insurer. 6.3.2.1 Information folder \u00b6 The information folder describes all the features of segregated funds and how they work. Specific fund details are provided in Fund Facts, which usually accompany the information folder. The purpose of the information folder is to provide brief and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the IVICs issued by the insurer. One information folder is typically issued by the insurer for all the funds it provides, although every fund has a unique identifier code. Below is a sample Fund Facts document. 6.3.2.2 Fund Facts \u00b6 A Fund Fact sheet is prepared for each fund as of December 31 of the preceding year. The details of each fund are presented consistently so that comparisons can be easily made between funds. It is essential for the agent to review the Fund Facts for the funds he has recommended with the investor. Source: Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers. Mutual Fund Facts. An example. [online]. [Consulted August 22, 2019]. https://lautorite.qc.ca/en/general-public/investments/investment-funds/fund-facts/mutual-funds-facts/ 6.3.2.3 Confirmation \u00b6 Confirmation is required to: Finalize purchase; Switch funds; Reset; Withdraw money from the contract; Terminate the contract. Confirmation may be provided to the investor electronically or in writing. Instructions provided verbally are as binding as if they were written. 6.3.3 Ongoing service requirements \u00b6 Sales activity for a segregated fund contract does not end with the purchase of the contract. It includes providing the following services: Post-sale follow-up; Monitoring the client; Monitoring the product; Annual client review; Handling deposits; Making fund switches when necessary; Resets; Changing the beneficiary designation; Renewing a contract. 6.3.3.1 Post-sale follow up \u00b6 The agent should follow up with the client once the sales process is completed to ensure his satisfaction with the product and to answer any questions. 6.3.3.2 Need to monitor client \u00b6 The client must notify the agent or insurer of changes to his personal situation that might affect the contract. 6.3.3.3 Need to monitor product \u00b6 New segregated funds are introduced; others are combined, and others discontinued. Agents need to know their products and keep on top of changes, such as a change in the management expense ratio (MER). Significant changes to a fund should be communicated to the client immediately. This is usually done by the insurer rather than the agent. 6.3.3.4 Annual review \u00b6 At a minimum, the agent should meet with the client once a year to review the selected investment and its performance. He should check with the client as to whether there are changes in his personal situation of which he should be aware. This is also a time to ensure the investor is aware of any significant changes that have occurred in the fund if applicable. 6.3.3.5 Handling deposits \u00b6 When a cheque accompanies the application, it must be handled securely and immediately sent to the insurer. The cheque should show the contract number to which the payment is to be applied. 6.3.3.6 Making a fund switch \u00b6 Fund switches may be scheduled or unscheduled. An unscheduled switch is made by request to the agent or insurer. The switch may be requested because the investor wishes to rebalance the account or is dissatisfied with fund performance. A minimum amount is required for the switch and the minimum balance for the fund must be met. Each insurer provides a number of switches a year for free. A withdrawal fee may be charged when switches exceed this limit. It is also possible for a switch to act as a reset that changes both the maturity date of the contract and contract guarantees. If units are switched within 90 days of purchase, a short-term trading fee may be charged, or the switch may not be permitted. A short-term trading fee is a charge against the value of the fund (e.g., 2%. Information about the amount of the fee is disclosed in Fund Facts). A scheduled switch is one set up on a regular basis, usually monthly or quarterly. There is no need for the client to make the switch request. Fees are not charged when switches are scheduled. However, the insurer can cancel the switches or redirect switched funds. If this occurs, the investor will be notified in advance and provided with options for the future. A capital gain or loss can be incurred by a switch to the extent the amount switched exceeds or is lower than the adjusted cost base of the units. 6.3.3.7 Resets \u00b6 A reset can be scheduled or unscheduled. Not all funds allow reset. When a reset is completed, the maturity date of the contract resets. For ten-year contracts, the new maturity date will be ten years from the reset date. Some insurers limit the age of the investor (or annuitant) at which a reset can be made (i.e., age 80). An unscheduled reset is used by an investor to lock in a gain when he sees the value of his units has increased. The number of resets per year may be limited by the insurer. It is best to try to achieve steady modest gains from resets. A scheduled, or automatic, reset may be restricted to the schedule set by the insurer, such as twice per year. The reset occurs only if the market value of the investment is higher than the unit\u2019s deposit value. 6.3.3.8 Change of beneficiary \u00b6 It may be necessary to change the beneficiary if, for instance, the beneficiary dies or the contract owner decides a new beneficiary is in order. This can be done at any time by the contract owner providing the beneficiary designation is not irrevocable. An irrevocable beneficiary can be changed if the beneficiary consents. A revocable beneficiary can be changed by the contract owner at any time in a written request to the insurer or by completing a change of beneficiary form. 6.3.3.9 Renewing a contract \u00b6 At the ten-year maturity of the contract, its value may be taken as cash or in the form of an annuity, or renewed for another period. When a contract is renewed, a new guarantee period begins. The new maturity date depends on the age of the annuitant when the contract is renewed. The deposit to the renewal contract is the market value of the original contract at maturity or the maturity guarantee value if it is higher than the market value. The death benefit guarantee continues. 6.4 Claims \u00b6 A claim can be made: By the contract owner for withdrawal, surrender and on maturity; By a beneficiary or an estate trustee (or equivalent) at death; By the person in control of the contract, when a POA for property is invoked, for withdrawal, surrender, and maturity. Once a claim is made, the claim is assessed for the value to be paid out. The actual payout is determined by the contract value minus any withdrawals and outstanding charges and fees. 6.4.1 Claims process \u00b6 The process for claims does not have to involve the agent since forms can be ordered directly from the insurer. 6.4.1.1 Claim forms \u00b6 Both withdrawal and death benefit claim forms can be ordered directly from the insurer. They must be returned completed and signed with any attachments and information the insurer specifies. Once forms are submitted, an insurance representative specializing in claims takes over handling the claim and issuing a cheque or cheques, or ensuring funds are transferred as requested. 6.4.2.1 Maturity claims and death claims \u00b6 The maturity guarantee is claimed when the contract has matured by the contract owner or person acting as POA for property. The death benefit guarantee is paid at the death of the annuitant to the beneficiary. Both guarantee amounts are contractually obligated as a percentage of deposits, adjusted upward by any resets and adjusted downward by any withdrawals from the contract. If the market value of the account is not equivalent to the guarantee, the insurer will step in and contribute a sum equal to the difference between market value and guarantee. The declaration of death is made by the beneficiary or estate trustee, who may be an executor, administrator, or liquidator (in Qu\u00e9bec). The contract number is provided in addition to the signature of the claimant and the agent\u2019s name, and number. Proof of death or the Attending Physician\u2019s Statement (APS) is required. The death claim must be accompanied by an original death certificate. Additional documents may be required especially if the death occurs outside the country. 6.4.2.2 Termination and surrender claims \u00b6 Termination occurs at contract maturity; surrender occurs before the contract has matured. Both activities constitute a claim and end the contract. The contract owner at termination may choose to receive the value of the contract in cash, to buy an annuity or another option provided by the insurer. Locked-in accounts may be restricted as to whether the cash can be received and their value may have to be transferred to another locked-in account depending on the legislation of the province that applies to the funds. 6.4.2.3 Withdrawal form \u00b6 The request for a withdrawal is initiated by the contract owner. The withdrawal form is used to both close the contract by withdrawing the total value of the account and to make a partial withdrawal. The form requires: Contract owner information; Identification of contract type; Selection of withdrawal options; Selection of form of payment (i.e., cheque, direct deposit, or transfer to another product or institution); Instructions to set up a scheduled withdrawal plan (SWP), for instance, when payments from a RRIF must begin; Fund (identified by its number) from which the withdrawal is to be made; Specified amount to be withdrawn; Signature of contract owner and irrevocable beneficiary if one exists; Signature of the agent with a date. Withdrawal options cover many circumstances beyond a partial or full withdrawal. The contract owner can also choose to: Set up or change a scheduled payment plan; Change the amount or date of scheduled payments; Change the allocation of scheduled payments; Change the banking information for scheduled payments; Stop scheduled payments. A minimum annual withdrawal is required when the contract is a RRIF. When the contract is a LIF or a restricted life income fund (RLIF), it must be more than the annual minimum and less than the annual maximum. 6.4.2.4 Power of attorney (POA) claim \u00b6 A power of attorney (POA) for property document appoints another person to act as a substitute decision-maker for all matters pertaining to the contract owner's property when the contract owner is unable to do so. The instructions for withdrawals or surrender made by the person with POA for property must be respected, and acted upon as if he was the contract owner. 6.4.3 Factors affecting claims \u00b6 The amount received in a claim may not be the amount anticipated by the contract owner. He must fully understand the effect of withdrawals, sales charges, guarantees, and allocations. 6.4.3.1 Maturity and death benefit guarantee \u00b6 The amount received at maturity or death can exceed the guaranteed amount when the market value of the contract is higher than the guarantee. If withdrawals are made from the contract, guarantees are adjusted downward in proportion to the account balance. The timing of the maturity guarantee can also be affected when reset is used. 6.4.3.2 Allocations \u00b6 When a segregated fund generates interest, dividends, or capital gains that income remains in the fund and is reflected in its unit value. This investment income and these capital gains or losses are allocated to investors annually. Note that an allocation attributes capital gains/losses; they are not received by the investor as cash. An allocation increases or decreases the adjusted cost base (ACB) of a non-registered investment. Consequently, this income is not taxed again upon withdrawal.","title":"Chapter 6 Segregated Found Contract"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_6_Segregated_Found_Contract/#chapter-6-segregated-found-contract","text":"","title":"CHAPTER 6: Segregated Found Contract"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_6_Segregated_Found_Contract/#61-contracts","text":"Contracts are legal documents that bind their parties to specified terms and conditions.

Their signatures confirm their agreement with the information. The agent must also provide specific information for the application to be processed. An exception is made to the requirement for the contract owner to sign the application when the contract owner is represented by a power of attorney (POA) for property. An agent may find a POA appointed for a client who is ill, mentally incapable or absent from the country for a prolonged period of time. The individual with the POA can complete and sign the application on behalf of the contract owner. However, he may not have rights to name the beneficiary.

If an account must be transferred from one form to another due to attained age, the insurer handles the change. The contract owner is set up with the proper account and the same fund. There may be a minimum value required to open an account and for different forms of account. The investor is informed of the unit value for each deposit.

A short-term trading fee is a charge against the value of the fund (e.g., 2%. Information about the amount of the fee is disclosed in Fund Facts). A scheduled switch is one set up on a regular basis, usually monthly or quarterly. There is no need for the client to make the switch request. Fees are not charged when switches are scheduled.

Policies are contracts that form a legal relationship between the client and the insurer. Certain terms in the contract called \u201cgeneral contract provisions\u201d can apply to all policies while other terms will be specific to the type of policy issued. A contract for a payout annuity is a commitment for a specified term or the life of the annuitant. The contract is final once it is issued; no changes can be made except to change the person named as beneficiary. The annuity rate that applies to the premium or premiums deposited by the investor applies for the duration of the annuity (unless the annuity is variable or indexed). If an annuity rate has been quoted and used in an illustration of the income to be paid by the contract for an immediate annuity, that rate may be guaranteed for a period by the insurer. A payout annuity application specifies that income payments are made based on: The annuity rate in effect; The type of annuity chosen; The frequency of payment. The accumulation annuity contract has provisions for: How interest is calculated and paid on the premium; Minimum and maximum withdrawal limits; How the contract is terminated. Amendments and addendums can be attached to a contract. An amendment may be used to waive a contract provision, or to correct an error or omission. 7.2 Investor Requirements \u00b6 The investor must: Assist the agent by providing all required information for the application form to be completed; Fund the contract. Each form of contract also has specific requirements: The payout annuity contract requires the investor to select a schedule for payment with details of the financial institution and account where payments are to be made; The accumulation annuity contract requires its owner to make choices that centre on its term for investment. 7.2.1 Application form \u00b6 There are significant differences between the application forms of insurers issuing annuities: Some incorporate all required information in the application itself; Other applications appear to rely on the agent to complete additional forms that must be attached with the application. Applications for the two types of annuities (payout and accumulation) are very different, and each insurer uses wording specific to its particular product. The agent and investor complete an annuity application together. The application may be provided online by the insurer or in a printed format. The application should be completed with the investor in one sitting. The agent must not take away a partially completed application to fill in the missing details on his own. Every application needs to be carefully reviewed before meeting with the investor, as it is being completed, and after it has been signed and is ready for submitting to the insurer. A mistake could be made while completing the application: When an application is in print form, a change can be made to correct an error, and both the investor and the agent initial the change as near to the changed information as possible. This is evidence that both parties acknowledge and agree to the change; A change to an online application can be made by deleting the incorrect information and inputting that which is correct. Consequently, the online application must be read with careful attention to detail before electronic transmission. Like an IVIC, an annuity application could be completed by a person who has power of attorney (POA) for property for another. Legal guidance is required if the person acting in the role of POA decides to name a beneficiary. Neither the agent nor the investor can modify, cancel, or waive any question on the application. Doing so can void the application. An application is not finalized until it is accepted by the insurer. As with the application for a segregated fund, a reason-why letter is prepared and reviewed with the client when the application is submitted. This letter does not confirm that the policy has been issued; it paraphrases what the agent has learned from the proposed client, confirms what was discussed and when and sets out the plan of action. The letter must be easy to understand and brief. After the agent has reviewed the letter with the client to ensure its accuracy, he should make a copy for his client file and the client. 7.2.1.1 Registered or non-registered annuity \u00b6 A contract may be issued for a registered or non-registered annuity. The registered contract is subject to rules set by the Income Tax Act (ITA) for registered accounts which include: The contract owner and annuitant must be the same person; The age at which income may be paid from the account; Requirement for a minimum withdrawal; Withholding tax on withdrawals; What happens to the account if the account owner dies. All withdrawals from registered accounts must be declared for tax purposes in the year in which they are made. A non-registered account is not subject to Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) rules for contributions, withdrawals, or tax deferral. A non-registered annuity may be taxed in a prescribed or accrual (non-prescribed) form. The prescribed form is preferred because the interest component of each payment is level over the life of the annuity. However, the many criteria for a prescribed annuity must be satisfied. 7.2.1.2 Naming annuitant and beneficiary \u00b6 The owner names his choice for annuitant and, if applicable, primary beneficiary and contingent beneficiary in the application. The agent must note the following: The owner and annuitant must be the same person if the annuity is registered or funded with registered savings; Two annuitants must be named in a joint annuity: the annuitant and the joint annuitant (also called the \u201cco-annuitant\u201d); A beneficiary must be named in the application except if the annuity is a life annuity with no guarantee period; When some or all of the premium is derived from a locked-in pension, all or part of the death benefit may become payable to the spouse instead of the beneficiary. In this case, the spouse\u2019s information must be provided unless the spouse has waived his rights to the benefit in a spousal waiver form. The beneficiary can be designated as revocable or irrevocable. The owner must understand the restrictions on the policy when an irrevocable beneficiary is named. For example, the irrevocable beneficiary cannot be changed without his consent. A contingent beneficiary can also be named in the application. He becomes the beneficiary if the primary beneficiary has died before the annuitant(s). A contingent beneficiary is always revocable. 7.2.1.3 Owner identification requirements \u00b6 The owner of an annuity contract is held to the same identification requirements as the owner of a segregated fund contract (See Section 6.2.1.4) Identification requirements do not apply when: An immediate or deferred annuity is funded by a transfer from a registered pension plan or proceeds of a group life insurance policy; The contract is registered. The owner of an annuity contract must also provide evidence of the age of each annuitant. If the owner is a legal entity, its identity must be confirmed by specific documentation. 7.2.2 Funding the contract \u00b6 Funding for the contract is received as cash (or equivalent) deposit or transfer of existing savings. Sources of funds include direct deposits from accounts and transfers made from both registered and non-registered savings: Personal savings or chequing account; Bonds; Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs); Tax-free savings accounts (TFSAs); Stocks, mutual funds, and segregated funds. A registered account can be funded by the transfer of funds from an RRSP at the same or another financial institution. A transfer is not considered a new contribution of funds. Registered funds from the following accounts may also be transferred to the registered annuity contract: Registered pension plan (RPP) contributions to a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) or recognized participation amount from a defined benefit pension plan (DBPP); Registered retirement income fund (RRIF); Locked-in retirement account (LIRA); Life income fund (LIF) or locked-in retirement income fund (LRIF); Deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP); Prescribed retirement income fund (PRIF); Restricted life income fund (RLIF). Example Louise, 62, receives a severance package from her employer including a cheque for $45,000. Instead of seeking another job, Louise decides to retire. She decides to buy an immediate life annuity, with a 25-year guarantee period, which will provide income right away. Louise has significant RRSP contribution room due to unused contribution room in previous years. With the help of her agent, Louise sets up a registered annuity with the $45,000 she received after having deposited this amount in an RRSP. This RRSP contribution is tax deductible. The payments she will receive as annuitant of the policy will be fully taxable in her hands. Example Sam, aged 62, is tired of playing the stock market and decides to stabilize his invested money in an accumulation annuity. His money is held in an RRSP at an investment broker. In his annuity application, he specifies the money held by the broker should be transferred into a registered annuity. This is not considered a new contribution, so there are no tax implications. Sam can continue to deposit to the account up to the authorized contribution limit, and these subsequent contributions are tax deductible. All payments Sam eventually receives from the annuity after it is converted to a payout annuity, comprising both the amount transferred and the amounts subsequently deposited, are fully taxable in his hands. 7.3 Agent Services and Requirements \u00b6 Once the contract has been delivered, the agent should view the service he can provide to contract owners as an ongoing activity, to both ensure changes are accommodated in the contract as necessary and to be alert for other product sales opportunities. One of the options available to all owners of an RRSP is to convert the value of their plan on maturity to a term to age 90 annuity or life annuity to continue tax deferral. Annuities are gaining ground as an RRSP maturity option due to their dependability as a source of guaranteed income. Annuities have no need for account management or ongoing decision-making as there is with a RRIF account. Also, a client with more than one RRSP that is maturing may be best served by conversion of one RRSP to an annuity and conversion of another RRSP to a RRIF to continue tax deferral. 7.3.1 Contract delivery \u00b6 Contracts may be delivered in person by the agent, mail or courier. 7.3.2 Ongoing service requirements \u00b6 Servicing the annuity contract centres on ensuring the beneficiary designation remains true to the owner\u2019s intention. An accumulation annuity may involve the agents with taking deposits and managing maturity of the contract to determine whether conversion to a payout annuity would be appropriate. 7.3.2.1 Change of beneficiary \u00b6 The contract owner can name whom he likes as beneficiary providing the beneficiary is revocable and there are no restrictions on the contract because it has been funded by a transfer of locked-in funds from a registered pension plan. A beneficiary may be replaced by another because the contract owner changes in mind or because the named beneficiary has died. A change of beneficiary form is completed by the contract owner and signed to effect the change. When it is submitted, all previous beneficiary designations are revoked. The completed form must be sent immediately to the insurer. 7.3.2.2 Handling deposits \u00b6 Deposits may be received by the agent as cash, a cheque, or bank draft. All deposits must be handled securely and forwarded to the insurer without delay. Cash deposits may be a transaction that falls under anti-money laundering legislation (Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act). The agent should provide a receipt to the client for any cash he receives as a deposit. Cheques and bank drafts are made payable to the insurer. If the contract has been assigned a policy number, it should appear on the cheque. 7.4 Claims \u00b6 A claim is made to receive some or all of the funds held in a contract. The person who makes the claim is known as the claimant. 7.4.1 Claims process \u00b6 The agent may provide the necessary claim form or information on: How to obtain the claim form; Documentation that must accompany the claim; Where the claim form must be sent for processing. A claim form must be complete and include the claimant\u2019s signature for processing to begin. A claims\u2019 representative issues payment for the claim in a cheque or cheques, or transfers funds as requested. 7.4.2 Types of claims \u00b6 Payout and accumulation annuities may see a claim on the death of the annuitant if a beneficiary is entitled to proceeds. A claim may be made by the contract owner for withdrawal or surrender of a term annuity or an accumulation annuity. 7.4.2.1 Death claims \u00b6 Table 7.1 summarizes who makes a death claim in annuity contracts when an annuitant dies. TABLE 7.1 Claimant for annuity death claims TYPE OF ANNUITY CLAIMANT Term annuity, prior to end of term Beneficiary Life annuity, no guaranteed period A claim cannot be made Life annuity, with a guaranteed period Beneficiary (during guaranteed period; no claim may be made after the end of the guaranteed period). Joint and last survivor annuity, death of first annuitant, no guarantee period Surviving annuitant Joint and last survivor annuity, death of second annuitant, no guarantee period A claim cannot be made Joint and last survivor annuity, death of second annuitant, with a guarantee period Beneficiary (during guaranteed period; no claim may be made after the end of the guaranteed period). Annuity with return of premium rider Beneficiary Accumulation annuity Beneficiary Example Douglas has an RRSP that is maturing. He chooses a term annuity to age 90 as the option most suitable to his needs during retirement. He names his four children as equal beneficiaries of the contract. Douglas receives a monthly income from the annuity. When he dies at age 86, his children share equally the balance of the contract. If the primary beneficiary has died before the annuitant, a contingent beneficiary may receive proceeds. If no living beneficiary exists, the claim is then made by the executor of the estate of the annuitant and paid to the estate of the annuitant. In provinces where they exist, probate fees could then apply since the proceeds become part of the value of the estate. No probate fees apply when a named beneficiary of an annuity contract receives the proceeds of the contract. Example Catherine received a monthly annuity payment from a life annuity with a 25-year guarantee period purchased by her husband before he retired from his senior level executive position. He wanted to supplement her Old Age Security (OAS) benefit, so the annuity started when Catherine was 65. Since Catherine and her husband have no children, the annuity named Catherine\u2019s sister, Norma, as beneficiary. Catherine\u2019s husband died several years ago, and Norma died last year. Because Catherine suffers from advanced memory loss, she did not remember that she has an annuity and that Norma was its beneficiary, so she did not name another beneficiary. When Catherine died this year, there was no beneficiary named in the contract to receive the benefit of the guarantee. Consequently, the balance of the annuity guarantee was paid in a cash refund to Catherine\u2019s estate. 7.4.2.2 Transfer of annuitants in joint contract \u00b6 A joint and last survivor annuity contract names both a primary annuitant and a second, or co-annuitant. The primary annuitant receives payments from the annuity for his lifetime. After his death, the second annuitant receives payment for life from the annuity. The switch is initiated when proof of death of the primary annuitant is provided to the insurer. 7.4.2.3 Surrender and withdrawal claims \u00b6 An accumulation annuity permits withdrawals, subject to minimum and maximum amounts, and surrender. When the accumulation annuity is cashed in before its maturity date, a market value adjustment (MVA) may be made by the insurer, which penalizes the contract owner by reducing the sum he receives. The amount of reduction due to the MVA is based on the amount of time remaining in the term of a guaranteed investment after the withdrawal or surrender, the interest rate at the time the investment was made, the current interest rate, and fees. A term annuity may also be surrendered. When a contract is surrendered, a penalty will be charged by the insurer according to contract terms. A life annuity may not be surrendered once annuity payments have started. When a claim for surrender or withdrawal is made, it must be in a form acceptable to the insurer. 7.4.2.4 Power of attorney (POA) claims \u00b6 A person acting in the position of power of attorney (POA) for property may have a special form to complete as a \u201cthird party\u201d in respect of the account. 7.4.3 Factors affecting claims \u00b6 Taxes are always withheld by the insurer according to the rules set out by the Income Tax Act when a contract is surrendered or a withdrawal is made. The amount received from the claim and how it is paid will depend on whether a cash refund or instalment refund has been chosen. A claim cannot be made against a life annuity unless a guarantee exists. The beneficiary is entitled to the guaranteed portion of the contract. The beneficiary has no further claim after the guaranteed period ends. Example Tara, at age 66, purchased a life annuity, paying $3,000 a month, with a 20-year guarantee period, and named her adult son, Rob, as the beneficiary of the annuity. Tara died 10 years later. Rob, as the beneficiary of Tara\u2019s annuity, will keep getting $3,000 a month for 10 years (i.e., until the end of the 20-year guaranteed period).","title":"Chapter 7 Annuity Contract"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_7_Annuity_Contract/#chapter-7-annuity-contract","text":"","title":"Chapter 7: Annuity Contract"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_7_Annuity_Contract/#71-contract","text":"Life annuities and term annuities sold by insurers are insurance policies.

The accumulation annuity contract has provisions for: How interest is calculated and paid on the premium; Minimum and maximum withdrawal limits; How the contract is terminated. Amendments and addendums can be attached to a contract. An amendment may be used to waive a contract provision, or to correct an error or omission.","title":"7.1 Contract"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_7_Annuity_Contract/#72-investor-requirements","text":"The investor must: Assist the agent by providing all required information for the application form to be completed; Fund the contract.

Applications for the two types of annuities (payout and accumulation) are very different, and each insurer uses wording specific to its particular product. The agent and investor complete an annuity application together. The application may be provided online by the insurer or in a printed format. The application should be completed with the investor in one sitting. The agent must not take away a partially completed application to fill in the missing details on his own. Every application needs to be carefully reviewed before meeting with the investor, as it is being completed, and after it has been signed and is ready for submitting to the insurer. A mistake could be made while completing the application: When an application is in print form, a change can be made to correct an error, and both the investor and the agent initial the change as near to the changed information as possible. This is evidence that both parties acknowledge and agree to the change; A change to an online application can be made by deleting the incorrect information and inputting that which is correct. Consequently, the online application must be read with careful attention to detail before electronic transmission. Like an IVIC, an annuity application could be completed by a person who has power of attorney (POA) for property for another. Legal guidance is required if the person acting in the role of POA decides to name a beneficiary. Neither the agent nor the investor can modify, cancel, or waive any question on the application. Doing so can void the application. An application is not finalized until it is accepted by the insurer. As with the application for a segregated fund, a reason-why letter is prepared and reviewed with the client when the application is submitted. This letter does not confirm that the policy has been issued; it paraphrases what the agent has learned from the proposed client, confirms what was discussed and when and sets out the plan of action. The letter must be easy to understand and brief. After the agent has reviewed the letter with the client to ensure its accuracy, he should make a copy for his client file and the client.","title":"7.2.1 Application form"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_7_Annuity_Contract/#7211-registered-or-non-registered-annuity","text":"A contract may be issued for a registered or non-registered annuity.

A registered account can be funded by the transfer of funds from an RRSP at the same or another financial institution. A transfer is not considered a new contribution of funds.

He chooses a term annuity to age 90 as the option most suitable to his needs during retirement. He names his four children as equal beneficiaries of the contract. Douglas receives a monthly income from the annuity. When he dies at age 86, his children share equally the balance of the contract. If the primary beneficiary has died before the annuitant, a contingent beneficiary may receive proceeds. If no living beneficiary exists, the claim is then made by the executor of the estate of the annuitant and paid to the estate of the annuitant.

Since Catherine and her husband have no children, the annuity named Catherine\u2019s sister, Norma, as beneficiary. Catherine\u2019s husband died several years ago, and Norma died last year. Because Catherine suffers from advanced memory loss, she did not remember that she has an annuity and that Norma was its beneficiary, so she did not name another beneficiary.

The agent works with the client to achieve the savings and investment objectives of the group the client represents. The sponsor offering this type of plan is making a commitment to its group members. There are financial obligations for the sponsor and administrative costs incurred when a group plan is offered. To provide sound advice to a sponsor or administrator, the agent must be familiar with the following. 8.1 Group Plan Structure \u00b6 A group plan is comprised of its: Sponsor; Administrator; Members; and Insurer The agent must be aware of the rights and responsibilities of each. 8.1.1 Group plan sponsor \u00b6 The group plan sponsor (typically the employer) establishes and registers the group registered pension plan (RPP) with Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and provincial authorities. The applicable provincial pension benefits legislation outlines the requirements for the group registered pension plan. This includes compliance with filing certain reports, the possible need for an auditor\u2019s report, actuarial reports, and other reports as needed by the jurisdiction in which the group plan is registered. On the other hand, some group pension plans are regulated on a federal level and are not subject to provincial legislation. Federally regulated pension plans are provided to employees who work in an industry that is federally regulated (i.e., banking). Group Retirement and Investment Plans Registration with CRA guarantees that the yearly maximum RRSP contribution limit is not surpassed since registered pension plan (RPP) contributions reduce the amount that can be paid to an RRSP. 8.1.1.1 Role of plan sponsor \u00b6 The sponsor\u2019s role is to: Design the pension plan according to its needs, yet within the sponsor\u2019s financial limitations; Set the benefit structure for members; Establish, amend, or terminate the plan; Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for reporting; Address funding shortfalls or surpluses. Final decisions about a group plan are the responsibility of the sponsor. However, the administrators and life insurance agent should guide the sponsor in his decisions. 8.1.1.2 Funding commitment by plan sponsor \u00b6 A sponsor takes on the financial commitment to fund the group plan as: A joint contributor with the group members; or Alone for the group members. When the sponsor and the group member both contribute to a plan, it is said to have contributory funding. Contributory plans include: Defined benefit pension plans (DBPPs); Defined contribution pension plans (DCPPs); Group registered retirement savings plans (GRRSPs); and Pooled registered pension plan (PRPPs). When the sponsor alone contributes to a plan, the plan is non-contributory: A deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP) is non-contributory; Other plans may also be non-contributory if the sponsor does not require employee contributions. Group member contributions are made through payroll deduction when a plan is contributory. Thus, the contribution is made before take-home pay is received. Contributory plans may be structured so that the sponsor offers a matching formula in which the sponsor bases its contribution on the amount of the contribution made by the group member. The sponsor can match a dollar-for-dollar contribution or a different percentage. The matching formula can be structured to: Increase over time: The matching contribution increases the longer the employee works for the employer. This can decrease employee turnover, and employee loyalty is rewarded. Reward employees based on their value to the sponsor: The matching contribution can vary for different categories of employees. Therefore, the most valuable employees are more highly rewarded for their service. Create loyalty: The matching contribution may apply after an employee has worked through a defined waiting period. This helps to retain employees and discourage new hires from seeking other employment opportunities. If matching contributions are not a condition of an employment contract or collective bargaining agreement, they can be altered or ended at any time The plan\u2019s vesting provisions also affect funding requirements for the sponsor. Vesting shows who owns the contributions of the sponsor to an employee's plan. During the vesting period, an employee who changes jobs only retains the contributions he made to his group plan\u2014not the sponsor contributions. Nonetheless, when the vesting period ends, the sponsor contributions become the property of the employee. In some cases, vesting is immediate and the employee retains both his and his employer\u2019s contributions when he leaves. Thus, a shorter vesting period is more expensive for the plan sponsor because his contributions could leave with the departing employee after the briefer period of time. Vesting periods are determined by each jurisdiction. Typically, two years is considered average\u2014but vesting may be immediate or as long as three years. Example Natalie begins her new job on September 1. Her employer plan, a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP), has a six-month waiting period. On March 1, her plan begins with a contribution made by Natalie, deducted from her payroll and a 100% matching contribution by her employer. The plan has a one-year vesting period. If Natalie changes employers before the end of the vesting period, she will retain the contributions she made to the plan. Her employer\u2019s contributions will be retained by the employer. However, if she leaves after one year, Natalie will retain both her contributions and those made by her employer. Natalie may be able to transfer her pension plan savings to her new employer. A locked-in retirement account (LIRA) is another transfer option available to her. If she decides on transferring to a LIRA, she can be in charge of the savings and will have investment options of her choosing, instead of being restricted to the limited options of the group plan. 8.1.2 Group pension plan administrator \u00b6 The plan administrator is appointed by the group pension plan sponsor. In Qu\u00e9bec, group plans with more than 25 members must be administered by a pension committee. Often, the sponsor is also the administrator. When the employer is also the plan administrator, the employer must take into account the plan\u2019s beneficiaries\u2019 best interests. The pension plan administrator has both a financial and administrative role. This role is performed by human resources, an accounting, or a third party. When a third party is used, it is often a firm that specializes in employee benefits and services. For a DCPP, the administrator may be the plan sponsor, a board of trustees, a financial institution (for a simplified pension plan) or a pension committee as defined by pension benefits standards legislation. 8.1.2.1 Role of group pension plan administrator \u00b6 The administrator is responsible for overall administration of the pension plan including: Management of the plan; Establishing a written statement of investment policy; Investing the fund assets in accordance with that policy; Creating and distributing other plan documents; and Acting in accordance with applicable legislation. The administrator\u2019s primary task is to administer the plan in line with the Act that governs the plan and its regulations. The administrator has a fiduciary duty to plan members: He must act truthfully, in good faith and the best interest of members, former members, and others in the plan; The administrator must also use the care, attentiveness, and skill when dealing with another person\u2019s property. The administrator: Ensures contributions are made by plan members; Describes the benefits of the group pension plan to job applicants and reinforces those benefits to members of the group; Enrolls new members and withdraws members who quit the company, or retire; Provides information; Initiates claims and processes withdrawals; and Makes changes as required. The administrator is also responsible for: Measuring employee satisfaction with the plan; Monitoring industry trends, governance guidelines, and legislative changes to keep the sponsor apprised of new developments; Suggesting potential plan and investment recommendations; Assisting with plan sponsor governance activities; and Reporting to the sponsor. 8.1.2.2 Data provided by group pension plan administrator \u00b6 The agent receives the data regarding the group\u2019s composition from the plan administrator to enable an application to be completed. This information is protected by privacy legislation and must be strictly guarded. The group plan administrator guarantees that all the required information is supplied to group members regarding the plan and their membership in the plan through the pension statement provided to them on a regular basis. The pension statement details can include: Type of plan; Amount deposited to the plan; Accumulated earnings; Account balance of the member; Investment allocation; Net return on the account for the period covered by the statement; Current years of service; Projected pension payable; Normal retirement date; Earliest retirement date at which an unreduced pension may be received; and Beneficiary details. The statement also states that all projections are estimates based on information provided by the sponsor. The actual terms of the pension plan should also be outlined in official by-laws. When a group plan member discontinues his participation in the group, the administrator must give him a written statement with information regarding: Details about the balance of funds (i.e., total funds available, in the member\u2019s account); Details about the pension benefits payable to the member; Options for transfer or withdrawal; Deadline for choosing an option. 8.2 Group Retirement and Investment Plans \u00b6 Group plans provide investment and retirement savings. These retirement and investment plans are associated mainly with employers even though they are available to multiple types of groups. The employees are the group members. A group plan for savings and investment, in particular to assist with retirement, is a valuable employment advantage. This is particularly true when the employer contributes to a plan on the employees\u2019 behalf. What are the benefits of the group pension plan? Employee pension savings grow faster and larger due to employer contributions; The value of a plan can be received by a beneficiary in the event of death of the plan owner; Payroll deductions\u2014saving occurs by removing the contribution immediately from earnings and then issuing the balance as take-home pay; and Creditor protection of savings, except when the account is a tax-free savings account (TFSA); Tax benefits\u2014group pension plan membership allows a group member to receive the pension income tax credit (at age 65 and older). This permits the pensioner to split pension income with his spouse, which in turn reduces income tax; A group plan is customized to the needs, wishes, and financial circumstances of its sponsor. The agent helps the sponsor to identify available options and create the plan that best meets objectives in the present and future. When there is already a plan in place, the agent should examine it to determine if it is in line with objectives and needs. From this, the agent should make a recommendation that reflects present conditions. 8.2.1 Existing plan \u00b6 An existing pension plan may become unsuitable for its sponsor. It may not attract the talent the company seeks, especially if a competing firm has a better group plan on offer. Instead of replacing a plan, there may also be good reasons to supplement one plan with another. For instance, providing a DCPP to all group members plus a DPSP that is based on company profitability for senior executives. The agent must evaluate and compare the existing plan against other similar plans to determine whether the plan\u2019s benefits are still in line with the objectives of its sponsor and members. Some principal factors of an existing plan that are analyzed are: Suitability of plan to sponsor objective; Cost of plan to sponsor; Investment options and their suitability for members; Rate of member participation; Compliance with regulatory requirements; and Support to members by the plan provider, such as a website customized for the specific plan that makes it easy for members to monitor and change investments. 8.2.2 Plans available \u00b6 Pension plans are either: A single employer plan: A pension plan for a person who works for one employer. A multi-employer pension plan (MEPP). Covers employees who work for two or more employers not associated with one another. Typically, a MEPP is found in unionized work environments, and contributions to a MEPP are made on a set contribution basis as stated in collective bargaining. Note that MPP rules differ between jurisdictions. This chapter only covers single-employer pension plans. Note: Agents should thoroughly familiarize themselves with the MEPP rules that apply in the jurisdiction where they work when there is a large unionized workforce. Some group savings and investing plans are only obtainable through a sponsor (such as DBPPs). Other plans are obtainable both through sponsors and to individuals who are not enrolled in group plans (such as TFSAs) Group plans are in place to supplement, not as a replacement for personal savings. Contributions to group plans may lessen RRSP contribution room. However, members should be encouraged to build savings outside their group plans for the future and take advantage of tax deferral on savings. A sponsor may put in place a single group plan or multiple group plans. For instance, a DCPP could be joined with a GRRSP or a DPSP to assist the employer to draw and keep top talent. A group plan member is enrolled in an accumulation plan (CAP) when he is offered to choose from two or more investment options within the plan. DBPPs are not CAPs because the member does not have to make any investment choices. DCPPs, PRPPs, GRRSPs, TFSAs, and DPSPs are all capital accumulation plans. Guidelines outline the rights and responsibilities of the plan sponsor, service providers, and members when the plan is a CAP. These guidelines are standards in place to ensure that members of a CAP receive the information and support they need to make appropriate investment choices. As discussed previously regarding their contribution to individual savings, these same plans must be considered from the sponsor\u2019s point-of-view: Defined benefit pension plan (DBPP); Defined contribution pension plan (DCPP); Group registered retirement savings plan (GRRSP); Deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP); Group tax-free savings account (TFSA); Pooled registered pension plan (PRPP); Groups may also be offered a non-registered investment account. The following group plans convert registered savings into a pension income stream for group members: Group life income fund (LIF) for savings created in a DCPP; Group registered retirement income fund (RRIF) for savings created in a GRRSP. A group member receives retirement income when the savings he has accumulated in his group plan are transitioned into a plan that pays a pension. One exception to this is the DBPP in which the pension is paid by the plan directly. Other plans may function similarly by accumulating savings. However, at retirement, many administrators entail their members to take the contributions\u2019 value in a lump sum. To receive a pension, those funds are transferred to a LIF or an annuity; both make payments and in this way, a personal pension is created. There are other pension plans that an agent may come across such as an Individual Pension Plan (IPP) or a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). However, these plans are not covered in this manual. 8.2.2.1 Defined benefit pension plan (DBPP) \u00b6 The defined benefit pension plan is a form of registered pension plan (RPP) that pays a known sum to its members at retirement. The pension income is typically determined by: Employment income; and Years of service. Contributions may be made by the sponsor alone (as noted previously, in a non-contributory plan) or by the sponsor and group plan member (a contributory plan). The sponsor is fully responsible for ensuring that funding is adequate to provide the promised pension at retirement. If contributions are insufficient or investment performance has not met expectations, the sponsor must make additional contributions to cover the shortfall. Sometimes, a sponsor is unable to meet its financial commitment to its pension plan. Such a plan is described as \u201cunderfunded.\u201d If the sponsor is insolvent it cannot be forced to fully fund a plan. In such a case, the pensioner-members receive a pension less than promised. A pension plan may also have a value (due to contributions and investment returns) with a greater value than its payment obligations. This is referred to as a \u201cpension surplus.\u201d Sponsors are discouraged from building surpluses, both by taxation of the surplus and because regulators or the courts can oblige a company to use a surplus to improve pension benefits. A defined benefit pension plan may be terminated by its sponsor or converted to a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP). A \u201ccombination\u201d or \u201chybrid pension plan\u201d refers to when a DCPP is offered in addition to a DBPP. Members are required to make contributions to the combination place. They can choose to increase their pension by making voluntary contributions to their DCPP. The group plan member has no investment choices to make when he is enrolled in a DBPP. All investment decisions are made by the sponsor and/or administrator. Sponsor contributions are a tax-deductible expense and are not a taxable benefit to the plan member. When income begins in retirement, it is paid as a life annuity for the member and his spouse, although the pension received by the spouse is typically a reduced amount. To match increases in the cost of living, a sponsor may choose to index payments. Indexing payments affects plan pricing for the sponsor. DBPPs were once the most common form of pension plan. This is no longer the case because some employers have recognized the significant ongoing financial commitment to the corporation created by pension contributions. This expense has been exacerbated by lower pension fund returns coupled with increasing lifespans. The low returns in the funds and pension income that is paid for a longer period of time mean that sponsors are being required to make up shortfalls by special contributions between pension fund value and obligations. Many have taken advantage of their right to switch their DBPP to another form of pension that is less expensive, such as a DCPP. Example Lifespans in Canada are on the rise, and this creates pressure on the sponsors of DBPPs who are committed to providing a pension for life for their plan members. For instance, the Ontario Teacher\u2019s Pension Plan is a well-funded DBP that provides generous benefits to its members, teachers in Ontario. It reported that, in 1990, the plan had 13 pensioners aged 100 or more. In 2019, there were 135. In 1990, the Plan expected a pensioner to receive his pension for 25 years. In 2019, the expected years on pension were 32. This illustrates the increasing financial pressure on a plan as a result of longer lifespans. 8.2.2.2 Defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) \u00b6 A defined contribution pension plan is also called a money purchase plan (MPP). A DCPP does not create the same financial burden on its sponsor as a DBPP because no set pension income is promised to members of a DCPP, so the sponsor is not responsible if a shortfall occurs. The members\u2019 pension is a result of: Amount of contributions made; How long contributions are made; Investment choice; and Performance of selected investments. Due to their reduced financial obligation for the sponsor, DCPPs are gaining market share over DBPPs. More sponsors are choosing to introduce a DCPP over a DBPP. Some DBPPs are being converted to DCPPs. The role of the DCPP sponsor is to: Set up a plan; Make their specified contribution to the plan; and Ensure continuing compliance with regulators. The DCPP administrator is responsible for the following: Educating all plan members about the plan\u2019s details. Providing members with investment information to make informed investment choices. The DCPP plan outlines the sponsor\u2019s minimum financial obligation, as a percentage of member income, for each plan member. There is no obligation to increase contributions over time. Sponsors can structure a DCPP to: Make participation optional; Require members to increase contributions over time; Restrict investment options available. Sponsor contributions are a tax-deductible expense and are not a taxable benefit to the plan member. The investments that will be made available to plan members are chosen by the sponsor or administrator. The sponsor or administrator may select the options for all members in particular circumstances. The investment options may include: Segregated funds; Mutual funds\u2014such as target-date funds (a form of mutual fund that becomes increasingly conservative as the date on which the funds are needed draws closer); and Guaranteed investment accounts. A member who monitors and manages his investments on an active basis may find the DCPP very advantageous because he can: Access available investment options; Switch among investments according to his needs and investment performance; and Tailor investment risk to his individual risk tolerance. Note that some plan members may find the investment choices difficult to grasp, leading to delayed decisions or a failure to even make decisions. The onus for investing to achieve their retirement savings goal is ultimately up to the group member despite the assistance provided by the sponsor or administrator. 8.2.2.3 Group life income fund (LIF) \u00b6 A group member with a DCPP is required to transfer his savings to an account that requires minimum withdrawals when he decides to receive his retirement income. The group member\u2019s choices are restricted because the group member\u2019s savings are locked-in. This limits his choices to income-paying accounts that accept locked-in funds such as group life income funds (LIFs). The LIF can be set up by: A person who transfers their pension savings; or The sponsor on a group basis\u2014a group LIF allows continuity for the plan member and lower administration fees than LIFs chosen on an individual basis. LIFs limit the maximum that can be withdrawn and require minimum yearly withdrawals. LIFs are available in all provinces. Provinces often refer to LIFs under different names; The percentages for minimum and maximum withdrawals vary between provinces. The sponsor can present the group LIF as: An additional employment benefit; A great benefit for employees intimidated by the possibility of going-it-alone when retirement arrives; and A way to decide what to do with their pension savings. 8.2.2.4 Group registered retirement savings plan (GRRSP) \u00b6 A group registered retirement savings plan is a savings plan in which contributions are made by sponsors and members. A GRRSP is fundamentally the same as an individual RRSP. Total yearly contributions to a group RRSP are restricted to the individual\u2019s RRSP deduction limit for the year (as provided by Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) in the latest Notice of Assessment). Example Reginald works as an assembler for an electronics manufacturer and earns $60,000 a year. He participates in the company\u2019s GRRSP\u2014both the employer and Reginald contribute 5% of his earnings to the plan. Total contributions to the GRRSP are $6,000 ((60,000 \u00d7 5%) \u00d7 2). Since Reginald\u2019s income was the same last year (i.e., $60,000) this year\u2019s RRSP deduction limit is $10,800 ( $60,000 \u00d7 18%). As Reginald\u2019s contribution to the company GRRSP was $6,000 for the year, he can contribute up to $4,800 ( $10,800 \u2013 $6,000) to his personal RRSP. A GRRSP does not usually allow the purchase of individual securities (i.e., stocks). GRRSPs have lower fees than an individual RRSP. Contributions made by the individual and the sponsor to the GRRSP vest immediately. Since their contributions will have vested whenever an employee leaves and become the property of the employee, a GRRSP can be costly for sponsors who have a high rate of staff turnover. The sponsor of a GRRSP incurs additional costs because their contributions are seen as additional salary paid to members. Payroll charges, such as Employment Insurance, are incurred on their contributions to the group plan. No financial commitment is made by GRRSP sponsors regarding an eventual pension for members. Members control their investments and contributions. They are ultimately responsible for creating their pension. Contributions are made through payroll deduction, making saving typically easier for members. Contributions made by the employer are taxable as income to the employee and are tax-deductible by the employer. The GRRSP sponsor\u2019s role is to collect and remit plan members\u2019 contributions. The sponsor does not have any other additional commitments to the plan. For this reason, GRRSPs may appeal to organizations with restricted resources available for plan administration. At plan maturity (i.e., the year in which the account owner turns 71 at the latest), savings accumulated in a GRRSP must be transferred into: A group or an individual RRIF; or An annuity, to continue tax deferral. 8.2.2.5 Deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP) \u00b6 A deferred profit sharing plan is solely funded by employer contributions. Contributions to the plan arise from profits. Years with lower profits may see the company suspend contributions. Consequently, a DPSP is most suitable for organizations with stable profitability to ensure that contributions to the group plan can be made on a continual basis. Employer contributions and fees are tax deductible for the business and are not a taxable benefit to plan members. On federal and provincial government plans, employer contributions are not subject to payroll taxes. A tangible advantage of this plan is that contributions are tied to business profitability. Therefore, it can be used as a way to motivate employee performance. Note that the following employees cannot be DPSP members: Employees who own 10% or more of the shares of the company; and Employees related to the employer or a specified shareholder. Members can make partial withdrawals at any time. On the other hand, a plan sponsor can choose to limit withdrawals while the member is employed. The members choose from the available investment options chosen by the sponsor. The sponsor does not commit to providing a future pension. A DPSP is often used in combination with a GRRSP to which only members contribute. Employee contributions to the GRRSP are matched by employer contributions to the DPSP. DPSP contributions create a pension adjustment for members and thus reduce RRSP contribution room. This is also possible with a DCPP. The money saved in a DPSP can be transferred to a group or an individual RRIF, or an annuity, to continue tax deferral. Example Mark, a life insurance agent, has set up a meeting with a technology company to review their group savings and investment plan. The company set up their group plan, a DCPP, a few years ago, believing that the plan provided a way for the company to attract some of the best talent in their business, video gaming, without creating financial pressure on the company. However, since that plan was implemented, the company has grown astronomically. It is enormously profitable and expects revenues and profitability to continue to grow. There is no problem hiring; the company is sought out by applicants due to the strength of its product line and commitment to ongoing development. The objective of the company is changing from using a group plan to attract employees to using a group plan to reward employees. Retirement income is not top of mind for employees right now since their average age is 36. Example (Cont.) Mark proposes a DPSP for the company. The DPSP can easily be funded from corporate profits and it aligns well with the philosophy of this younger workforce who strongly believe company profits should be shared with those who help create those profits. Mark illustrates the benefits of the DPSP in comparison to the DCPP and any disadvantages. If the company proceeds, it will continue to offer its DCPP plan since the DCPP continues to provide dependability in case the fortunes of the company change, and the DPSP will start once it has been properly registered and a contract issued to the sponsor. 8.2.2.6 Group registered retirement income fund (RRIF) \u00b6 The sponsor may set up the group registered retirement income fund (RRIF) on behalf of the member to transition registered savings (in a GRRSP or DPSP) into pension income. A group RRIF accepts transfers directly from the GRRSP or DPSP and offers its members the same features as RRIFs available to individuals. There is no maximum to the amount a member may withdraw; however, the plan requires a minimum annual withdrawal. The final date in which savings in the GRRSP or DPSP can be rolled into the RRIF is the end of the year when the plan member turns 71. It is most appropriate to set up a RRIF when retirement income is needed. This is due to the obligatory annual minimum withdrawals, with the exception of the first year. However, an individual may set up a RRIF at any age. Withdrawals from a RRIF are fully taxable as income 8.2.2.7 Group tax-free savings account (TFSA) \u00b6 The group tax-free savings account provides: No tax deductions on contributions; No need for tax deferral; No taxation on withdrawals. Like other group plans: Sponsors are not required to contribute; all contributions are considered income; Sponsors are not responsible for providing a pension income to group members; A choice of investments is available. The group TFSA restricts contributions in the same that individual TFSAs are restricted. Each taxpayer is allotted an annual contribution limit (the dollar amount of contribution permitted for the year plus any unused contribution room from previous years). That sum is available for his group plan contribution, his individual plan contribution, or a combination of both. In other words, one limit for the total of all contributions. The annual limit cannot be exceeded without stiff penalties. A significant TFSA advantage is that contribution room is independent of other plans. Thus, the maximum contribution can be made to a TFSA and an RRSP. Typically, members benefit from lower investment fees in the group plan compared to individual plans. Contributions of the TFSA are not locked-in. Therefore, compared with other group plans, group plan members are provided with the flexibility to make tax-free withdrawals at any time. Example Darleen is the owner of a small, prestigious real estate firm that serves a niche market in a wealthy suburb. Her employees, all real estate agents, are at either end of the usual working age: either they are in their mid-to-late 60s or their mid-to-late 20s. They all earn significant six-figure incomes every year and have enjoyed high earnings for the past number of years. Darleen\u2019s financial success is a result of her agents\u2019 success, and she wants a group plan that will recognize employees\u2019 lengthy service without creating a significant tax burden for them. She knows that they have all made maximum RRSP contributions and have no available contribution room. They all pay tax at the highest marginal tax rate. Darleen needs to retain her long-standing employees. She knows from experience that the younger ones are not particularly loyal, but the older employees are. None of them plan to retire in the foreseeable future. A group TFSA does not have a maximum age for contributions so, on this basis, is a good fit for Darleen\u2019s older employees. Darleen creates a group TFSA for her more experienced employees on the basis of their years of service: those who have worked for ten years or more for Darleen are eligible to join. Darleen contributes the annual maximum to each employee\u2019s plan and is quite happy to bear the cost of contributions plus additional payroll taxes. The agents can make withdrawals from the account, whenever they wish, on a tax-free basis. This approach is very tax efficient for the members of the group plan. 8.2.2.8 Pooled registered pension plan (PRPP) \u00b6 The pooled registered pension plan is a new group pension savings plan intended for individuals who: Do not have employer-provided pension plans; or Are self-employed. Licensed PRPP Administrators, who include some large life insurance companies, provide individuals access to the plan. PRPPs are available on a federal level. They may be made available in all Canadian provinces\u2014each province must enact its own PRPP legislation before the plan can be offered. Qu\u00e9bec has adopted a matching plan, the voluntary retirement savings plan (VRSP). The PRPP provides smaller companies with a pension plan for employees without the compliance obligations of other group plans. Plan members benefit from: Lower administration costs (than with individual savings options); and Portability\u2014as members change jobs, the PRPP follows them. Employers and employees may both contribute to the plan; contribution limits are the same as individual RRSPs. There is no commitment made for a future pension. Contributions made by the employer are not included in the member\u2019s income. Contributions are not tax deductible for the member. 8.3 Group Plan Investment Options \u00b6 Members of group plans pay lower investing fees in comparison to individual investors; this allows more of their savings to work as investments. The plan sponsor selects the investment options available to group members. The group members choose from these available investment options. The management expense ratio (MER) is less than what an individual would pay when the group investment is a segregated fund. Example Ten years ago Janet\u2019s contribution to her DCPP was $4,000 for the year. She invested in the most growth-oriented segregated fund she could identify. The fund earned 10% annually and, because it was offered through a group plan, the MER was just 1% per year (net return of 9%, i.e., 10% \u2013 1% MER). After 10 years, Janet\u2019s initial investment was worth $9,469.45 ( $4,000 \u00d7 1.0910). If Janet had made the same investment outside the group plan, the MER charged would have been 2% per year (net return of 8%, i.e., 10% \u2013 2% MER). After 10 years, Janet\u2019s initial investment would be worth $8,635.70 ( $4,000 \u00d7 1.0810). Therefore, in 10 years, Janet was able to increase the value of her initial investment by $833.75 ( $9,469.45 \u2013 $8,635.70) due to the lower management fees charged to the group. 8.3.1 Segregated funds for groups \u00b6 Segregated funds are an investment option made available to members of pension plans, except those enrolled in a DBPP. 8.3.1.1 Types of funds available \u00b6 There is a significant amount of choice regarding types of funds available. The segregated funds available to group members in a customized group plan are picked, often with the help of the agent, by the sponsor or administrator. The sponsor or administrator ensures that group members can select funds that offer capital preservation, growth, or income alone or in combination. 8.3.1.2 Advantages and disadvantages of group segregated funds \u00b6 Segregated funds available to group members have particular characteristics such as: No sales charges; No switch fees; Lower MER; No maturity guarantee or death benefit guarantee. The absence of these guarantees raises the risk of investment loss for the group member. 8.3.2 Annuities for groups \u00b6 Annuities for groups are provided for: The group itself; Group members; and Retiring group members. 8.3.2.1 Types of annuities available \u00b6 Sponsors that offer DBPPs face substantial risk in funding their pension responsibilities in the future. With the help of actuaries, they must predict the amount of funds they should set aside in their pension fund for future pension payments. A way to mitigate that risk is for the sponsor to purchase annuities from an insurer in a \u201cpension buy-in.\u201d How does the pension buy-in work? An insurer sells annuities to the pension plan sponsor that have guaranteed payout rates that match the sponsor\u2019s pension obligation; The insurer then becomes the provider of the pension benefit; Therefore, the insurer assumes the risk of funding the future pension from the sponsor; The benefits promised to retirees are unaltered. Companies who go out of business are still required to meet their pension obligations. Therefore, the pension buy-in can be useful for companies that wind up their pension plans because they go out of business. Their retired group members will still receive their pensions as expected from the insurer. GRRSP members may be provided with an accumulation annuity for their savings\u2014the annuity pays guaranteed interest for a set term or a date stated by the investor. DBPP members have a life annuity option when their contribution ends at retirement. GRRSP and DPSP members may select a term annuity or a life annuity. Life annuities may be available as a joint and last survivor annuity and offered with or without a guarantee period. 8.3.2.2 Advantages and disadvantages of group annuities \u00b6 Group annuities provide the dependability of income, security, stability, and peace of mind. Group annuities have no flexibility for withdrawals, and they cannot be ended once payments initiate. Pension payments are linked to the annuity rate at the time of purchase \u2013 since payments will not increase if interest rates rise, the annuities therefore carry interest rate risk and inflation risk. 8.4 Group Plan Recommendation \u00b6 The agent must diligently put together group plan recommendations. The agent should consider: Member demographics; Member skill level and expertise; Member education; Member loyalty to the employer (measured by employee turnover). The agent needs to understand overall group goals when establishing a savings and investment plan as well as the factors motivating a group to change from an existing plan. The agent has a disclosure commitment to his client, the sponsor. The agent must notify the sponsor of the insurers that he places business with, predominantly the firm that is being recommended for the sponsor\u2019s policy. In Qu\u00e9bec, an agent who is bound by an exclusive contract with an insurer must disclose this fact to his sponsor-customer. The agent must notify the sponsor of any existing financing arrangements in place between the insurer and the agents. These arrangements can be viewed as a conflict of interest. Otherwise: The sponsor must be provided with the basic information regarding whether the agent is compensated by commission or a fee, and if a bonus or travel incentive exists; Specific dollar amounts must be provided if the sponsor asks for such details; The agent must also attain written approval from the sponsor if he receives an increase in compensation following the completion of the sale. The agent must be prepared with executive-level presentations of his recommendations that address: Plan specifications; Plan and investment recommendations; Pension credits and adjustments. The plan will specify when or under what conditions a group member is entitled to receive a full or partial pension. This has a direct bearing on the sponsor\u2019s cost for the plan. The DBPP may state a set age (i.e., 65) or a required number of years of employment (called service)\u2014or a combination the two\u2014that must be satisfied before the full pension can be paid. The generic formula of age plus service is called a qualifying factor. It is more commonly known by the actual number associated with a plan, such \u201cthe 85 factor.\u201d Note that it does not have to be the number 85; at one time it was known as \u201cthe 90 factor.\u201d It could just as easily be \u201cthe 75 factor.\u201d The employee adds together his age and qualifying years of employment. For example, an employee who is 55 and has 30 years of employment with the sponsor meets an 85 (55 + 30) factor. If his pension required the 85 factor to be satisfied in order to qualify for a full pension, then this employee could retire with a full pension at age 55. A plan may also indicate a minimum age at which the full pension can be received. A partial pension may be paid if the full factor cannot be satisfied\u2014either because the employee does not have enough years of service or because he is too young. The plan document will outline the conditions for paying the partial pension. 8.4.1 Review of plan specifications \u00b6 What questions must be addressed in a recommendation and final decision? They include: Funding : Will there be a sponsor funding commitment, and if so, how much? Will contributions be uniform across all group members? When will vesting occur? Costs : What are the costs of each type of plan to the sponsor, including contributions and administration? How will the sponsor determine the age at which a full retirement pension will be paid? Sponsor characteristics : Is the sponsor anticipating significant growth in its workforce? How does this impact the group plan? Group members : Is it more important to retain some members than others? How can the sponsor ensure members participate? Is the sponsor prepared for its commitment to educate members when the plan falls under CAP guidelines? Administration : Who will the administrator be? 8.4.2 Recommendation for a plan and its investments \u00b6 Developing a recommendation requires the agent needs to comprehend the composition of the group in order to understand whose needs will be served and whether needs are short term or long term. For example, if the group is comprised of members for whom average member age is young, then a plan that provides retirement benefits alone may not be the best fit for that sponsor or its members. A GRRSP addresses retirement income but also provides benefits such as the Home Buyers\u2019 Plan and the Lifelong Learning Plan (LLP). A group TFSA permits withdrawals; this flexibility can be very attractive to those with short-term cash requirements. A DPSP can have an immediate effect on employee morale and retention when employees receive deposits to their plan from their employer. When the administrator and agent have reached their conclusions, the agent develops his recommendation for the most suitable type of plan and its investments with the group specialists at the insurer or insurers he represents. Group specialists are experts in group plan structure and delivery. They also keep informed of changes in legislation and compliance requirements. The sponsor must be prepared for its pension funding obligation and the effect that this has on profitability and shareholder expectations. 8.4.3 Pension credits and adjustments \u00b6 Pension credits are created in plans except in GRRSPs, PRPPs, and group TFSAs. The pension credit is a measure of the value of the benefit the member earned during the calendar year. The method an employer uses to calculate pension credits depends on the type of plan and its provisions. Pension credits for DBPPs, DCPPs, and DPSPs are calculated to determine a member\u2019s pension adjustment (PA) for the year. The PA reduces the amount that a member can contribute to an RRSP or a PRPP in the following year. Therefore, an RRSP or PRPP maximum contribution for a DBPP, DCPP, or DPSP member is: Contribution based on previous year\u2019s earned income (to annual maximum) - pension adjustment = this year\u2019s contribution limit Example Ahmad\u2019s maximum contribution limit for his RRSP this year is 18% of his previous year\u2019s earned income. His earned income for the previous year is $48,000, so his maximum RRSP contribution is $8,640 ( $48,000 \u00d7 18%). His pension adjustment for last year was $3,300 due to the contributions made to his DCPP at work. Therefore, he can contribute $5,340 ( $8,640 \u2013 $3,300) to his RRSP this year. Contribution room to an RRSP and PRPP can be increased by a pension adjustment reversal (PAR). If too much has been taken as a pension adjustment (PA) in a year - for instance, due to the plan member retiring or being terminated during the year - then the PA is recalculated. The difference between the full and the reduced PA is the PAR. A sponsor may increase benefits of a plan by retroactively increasing the benefit formula: This creates a past service pension adjustment (PSPA) for the member; A PSPA reduces RRSP contribution room; The administrator must calculate and report PSPAs. 8.5 Group Plan Documents \u00b6 Many documents must be provided to the pension authority in the jurisdiction in which the plan is being registered by the plan sponsor. Like all forms that the agent has a role in completing, those required to establish a group account must be filled out accurately and submitted in a timely manner to the insurer. The insurer that manages the pension for the sponsor provides a regular financial report to the sponsor. The report informs the sponsor about investment income and benefits paid to members. It also provides information on the allocation of funds among investment options and the members. 8.5.1 Application \u00b6 A group application is completed first by the administrator on behalf of the group. The application goes through underwriting by the insurer. The contract is then prepared, naming the sponsor or the administrator as contract owner or holder. Once the application for the group is approved group members can apply on their own behalf as they become qualified to join the plan. Members may not enroll until their waiting period has been completed. All members entitled to participate in the group plan by plan design are accepted. For instance, a plan could be set up so that all employees who have worked for the employer for six months are entitled to join the pension plan and are automatically enrolled. 8.5.1.1 Member forms \u00b6 Forms to be completed by members are provided through their group administrator or a website that provides secure member account access. Membership enrollment is the first form for a member to complete. Members receive a certificate of membership that details the many aspects of their plan. It includes an identification number. At the time of enrollment, members may have forms to name, or change, a beneficiary or provide a waiver of a joint and last survivor pension, a waiver of a preretirement death benefit. A member may also temporarily leave the plan due to disability or maternity leave. A leave of absence form is provided to accommodate a suspension of contributions for reasons specified by the plan. Using this form also means the member does not need to satisfy another waiting period to rejoin the plan after he returns to work. At retirement, the plan member must provide a notification of intended retirement before retirement actually occurs. Income begins at the selected date if plan requirements for minimum age or age plus service have been met. 8.5.2 Account transfer \u00b6 Members with locked-in pension contributions may be required to transfer the value of their pension plan when they no longer work for the plan sponsor, due to retirement or a change in employers. The administrator facilitates transfers according to the instructions of the member. 8.5.2.1 Transfer options \u00b6 The sponsor follows the instructions of the plan member when he leaves the plan due to a change in employment or retirement. Options available for transfer depend on the type of plan and whether the plan member wishes to continue savings or to begin receiving income. Whether the income starts partly depends on age at the time of transfer, since withdrawals may not be possible before a specified age. There are many conditions that must be carefully considered by the group member when a group plan-to-plan transfer is contemplated. An agreement transfer between DBPPs allows a member of a DBPP, who quits one plan to transfer the commuted value of his pension rights into the pension plan of the new employer and be recognized for years of service under the new plan. The terms of pension plans are not all the same. The value of one plan may not be equivalent to another plan, and a shortfall can arise. If so, the employee can contribute the sum needed to make up the shortfall in a lump sum within a specified deadline or pro-rate the amount of transfer. Plans may also differ as to when a pension is available. A group member would likely not want to transfer commuted value from one plan that permitted retirement on a full pension at age 62 to another plan, in which the full pension is provided at age 65. The member of a DCPP may be offered an entirely different set of investment options if he transfers to another pension plan. Even if he finds the new range of options unsuitable, the transfer cannot be undone. A transfer of accumulated funds to a locked-in retirement account (LIRA), or other self-administered plan, eliminates the problems associated with a group plan-to-plan switch. The account owner must be prepared to make investment decisions, from the universe of choices as he \u201cgoes it alone.\u201d For best results, he should be knowledgeable about the investments available to him and be prepared to monitor his account regularly. He takes on the responsibility of creating the equivalent of the pension income for himself and his spouse. Table 8.1 Plan administrator responsibility when a member leaves his employer or retires TYPE OF PLAN WHEN EMPLOYEE LEAVES HIS EMPLOYER WHEN EMPLOYEE RETIRES Defined benefit pension plan (DBPP) or Defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) Leave in the plan the member\u2019s pension rights or calculate the commuted value of DBPP pension or value of the DCPP and transfer to an option suitable for locked-in funds or to the new employer\u2019s group plan. Begin retirement DBPP pension payments, or transfer the commuted value of DBPP pension or value of the DCPP to an option suitable for locked-in funds. Group registered retirement savings plan (GRRSP) Transfer value to the employee\u2019s individual RRSP, RRIF, or group plan of a new employer. The plan may also be cashed out. Cash out the value of the plan, or transfer the value of the plan to a GRRIF or RRIF, or buy a term or life annuity. Deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP) Transfer value to the employee\u2019s individual RRSP, RRIF or group plan of a new employer, purchase an annuity (term or life annuity), or cash out the value of the plan. Cash out the plan, or transfer the value of the plan to an RRSP, GRRIF, RRIF or buy a term or life annuity. Group tax-free savings account (TFSA) Transfer value to the employee\u2019s individual TFSA or cash out the value of the plan. Transfer value to the employee\u2019s individual TFSA or cash out the plan. 8.6 Agent Service Requirements \u00b6 Agents may initiate the process of implementing a group savings and investment plan by identifying potential sponsors, and meeting with them to illustrate the advantages of such a plan. Throughout the entire group process of sales and service, the agent responds to the sponsor\u2019s needs and is the point of contact and source of group information for the insurer while a quote is being developed. 8.6.1 Review plan with sponsor \u00b6 The agent must seek regular input from the sponsor or administrator about the existing plan to retain and enhance the business relationship. Reviewing a recommendation that has been made and not acted upon can be important in building group business. 8.6.1.1 Annual review \u00b6 An annual review gives the agent the opportunity to reinforce the value of the plan and learn of changes about the sponsor. It is essential for the agent to stay informed of changes to group savings and investment products, and how those changes could affect the sponsor\u2019s plan. He should also maintain a high standard of knowledge about pension trends to discuss their impact with the sponsor. 8.6.1.2 Change in circumstances \u00b6 Just as important as providing information to a sponsor or administrator is the agent\u2019s service role in bringing information about a sponsor back to the insurer. The insurer needs to know about changes to the composition of a workforce (both growth and shrinkage), financial circumstances of the sponsor, change in administrators, and other relevant details. A sponsor may choose to wind up, or end its pension plan. This requires filing the necessary forms with the provincial pension regulator. The value of the pension plan is held in trust for its members and cannot be accessed by the sponsor. 8.7 Claims by Group Members \u00b6 A claim from a group member is initiated to receive the funds in the plan. To make a claim, a group member needs to provide the group name and certificate or identification number to the insurer. The appropriate claim form must be completed by the group member to enable the claim to be processed. If a group member dies, the spouse will be called upon for information to enable his claim to the pension proceeds. 8.7.1 Claims for exceptional circumstances \u00b6 Contributions to some group plans are the basis for locked-in savings. Withdrawals cannot usually be made by the group member when savings are locked-in. However, there are some exceptions to the locking-in rule that allow the savings to be accessed earlier than they would otherwise be available or in larger withdrawal amounts. They include when: Life expectancy of the contributor is shortened; Financial hardship is proven; The member is no longer a Canadian resident; The balance of the account is less than a specified sum; Funds are being transferred to a life income fund (LIF) or restricted life income fund (RLIF for federal pensions), and a partial withdrawal is available. Claims being made under any of these circumstances require that the necessary forms be completed by the group plan member.","title":"Chapter 8 Group Retirement and Investment Plans"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_8_Group_Retirement_and_Investment_Plans/#chapter-8-group-retirement-and-investment-plans","text":"","title":"Chapter 8: Group Retirement and Investment Plans"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_8_Group_Retirement_and_Investment_Plans/#80-group-retirement-and-investment-plans","text":"This chapter examines the agent\u2019s role in providing service to a client who is a group sponsor or administrator.

When the sponsor and the group member both contribute to a plan, it is said to have contributory funding. Contributory plans include: Defined benefit pension plans (DBPPs); Defined contribution pension plans (DCPPs); Group registered retirement savings plans (GRRSPs); and Pooled registered pension plan (PRPPs). When the sponsor alone contributes to a plan, the plan is non-contributory: A deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP) is non-contributory; Other plans may also be non-contributory if the sponsor does not require employee contributions. Group member contributions are made through payroll deduction when a plan is contributory. Thus, the contribution is made before take-home pay is received. Contributory plans may be structured so that the sponsor offers a matching formula in which the sponsor bases its contribution on the amount of the contribution made by the group member. The sponsor can match a dollar-for-dollar contribution or a different percentage. The matching formula can be structured to: Increase over time: The matching contribution increases the longer the employee works for the employer. This can decrease employee turnover, and employee loyalty is rewarded. Reward employees based on their value to the sponsor: The matching contribution can vary for different categories of employees. Therefore, the most valuable employees are more highly rewarded for their service. Create loyalty: The matching contribution may apply after an employee has worked through a defined waiting period. This helps to retain employees and discourage new hires from seeking other employment opportunities. If matching contributions are not a condition of an employment contract or collective bargaining agreement, they can be altered or ended at any time The plan\u2019s vesting provisions also affect funding requirements for the sponsor. Vesting shows who owns the contributions of the sponsor to an employee's plan. During the vesting period, an employee who changes jobs only retains the contributions he made to his group plan\u2014not the sponsor contributions. Nonetheless, when the vesting period ends, the sponsor contributions become the property of the employee. In some cases, vesting is immediate and the employee retains both his and his employer\u2019s contributions when he leaves. Thus, a shorter vesting period is more expensive for the plan sponsor because his contributions could leave with the departing employee after the briefer period of time. Vesting periods are determined by each jurisdiction. Typically, two years is considered average\u2014but vesting may be immediate or as long as three years. Example Natalie begins her new job on September 1. Her employer plan, a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP), has a six-month waiting period. On March 1, her plan begins with a contribution made by Natalie, deducted from her payroll and a 100% matching contribution by her employer. The plan has a one-year vesting period. If Natalie changes employers before the end of the vesting period, she will retain the contributions she made to the plan. Her employer\u2019s contributions will be retained by the employer. However, if she leaves after one year, Natalie will retain both her contributions and those made by her employer. Natalie may be able to transfer her pension plan savings to her new employer. A locked-in retirement account (LIRA) is another transfer option available to her. If she decides on transferring to a LIRA, she can be in charge of the savings and will have investment options of her choosing, instead of being restricted to the limited options of the group plan.","title":"8.1.1.2 Funding commitment by plan sponsor"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_8_Group_Retirement_and_Investment_Plans/#812-group-pension-plan-administrator","text":"The plan administrator is appointed by the group pension plan sponsor.

A multi-employer pension plan (MEPP). Covers employees who work for two or more employers not associated with one another. Typically, a MEPP is found in unionized work environments, and contributions to a MEPP are made on a set contribution basis as stated in collective bargaining. Note that MPP rules differ between jurisdictions. This chapter only covers single-employer pension plans. Note: Agents should thoroughly familiarize themselves with the MEPP rules that apply in the jurisdiction where they work when there is a large unionized workforce. Some group savings and investing plans are only obtainable through a sponsor (such as DBPPs). Other plans are obtainable both through sponsors and to individuals who are not enrolled in group plans (such as TFSAs) Group plans are in place to supplement, not as a replacement for personal savings. Contributions to group plans may lessen RRSP contribution room. However, members should be encouraged to build savings outside their group plans for the future and take advantage of tax deferral on savings. A sponsor may put in place a single group plan or multiple group plans. For instance, a DCPP could be joined with a GRRSP or a DPSP to assist the employer to draw and keep top talent. A group plan member is enrolled in an accumulation plan (CAP) when he is offered to choose from two or more investment options within the plan. DBPPs are not CAPs because the member does not have to make any investment choices. DCPPs, PRPPs, GRRSPs, TFSAs, and DPSPs are all capital accumulation plans. Guidelines outline the rights and responsibilities of the plan sponsor, service providers, and members when the plan is a CAP. These guidelines are standards in place to ensure that members of a CAP receive the information and support they need to make appropriate investment choices. As discussed previously regarding their contribution to individual savings, these same plans must be considered from the sponsor\u2019s point-of-view: Defined benefit pension plan (DBPP); Defined contribution pension plan (DCPP); Group registered retirement savings plan (GRRSP); Deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP); Group tax-free savings account (TFSA); Pooled registered pension plan (PRPP); Groups may also be offered a non-registered investment account. The following group plans convert registered savings into a pension income stream for group members: Group life income fund (LIF) for savings created in a DCPP; Group registered retirement income fund (RRIF) for savings created in a GRRSP. A group member receives retirement income when the savings he has accumulated in his group plan are transitioned into a plan that pays a pension. One exception to this is the DBPP in which the pension is paid by the plan directly. Other plans may function similarly by accumulating savings. However, at retirement, many administrators entail their members to take the contributions\u2019 value in a lump sum. To receive a pension, those funds are transferred to a LIF or an annuity; both make payments and in this way, a personal pension is created. There are other pension plans that an agent may come across such as an Individual Pension Plan (IPP) or a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). However, these plans are not covered in this manual.","title":"8.2.2 Plans available"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_8_Group_Retirement_and_Investment_Plans/#8221-defined-benefit-pension-plan-dbpp","text":"The defined benefit pension plan is a form of registered pension plan (RPP) that pays a known sum to its members at retirement. The pension income is typically determined by: Employment income; and Years of service. Contributions may be made by the sponsor alone (as noted previously, in a non-contributory plan) or by the sponsor and group plan member (a contributory plan). The sponsor is fully responsible for ensuring that funding is adequate to provide the promised pension at retirement. If contributions are insufficient or investment performance has not met expectations, the sponsor must make additional contributions to cover the shortfall. Sometimes, a sponsor is unable to meet its financial commitment to its pension plan. Such a plan is described as \u201cunderfunded.\u201d If the sponsor is insolvent it cannot be forced to fully fund a plan. In such a case, the pensioner-members receive a pension less than promised. A pension plan may also have a value (due to contributions and investment returns) with a greater value than its payment obligations. This is referred to as a \u201cpension surplus.\u201d Sponsors are discouraged from building surpluses, both by taxation of the surplus and because regulators or the courts can oblige a company to use a surplus to improve pension benefits. A defined benefit pension plan may be terminated by its sponsor or converted to a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP). A \u201ccombination\u201d or \u201chybrid pension plan\u201d refers to when a DCPP is offered in addition to a DBPP. Members are required to make contributions to the combination place. They can choose to increase their pension by making voluntary contributions to their DCPP. The group plan member has no investment choices to make when he is enrolled in a DBPP. All investment decisions are made by the sponsor and/or administrator. Sponsor contributions are a tax-deductible expense and are not a taxable benefit to the plan member. When income begins in retirement, it is paid as a life annuity for the member and his spouse, although the pension received by the spouse is typically a reduced amount. To match increases in the cost of living, a sponsor may choose to index payments. Indexing payments affects plan pricing for the sponsor. DBPPs were once the most common form of pension plan. This is no longer the case because some employers have recognized the significant ongoing financial commitment to the corporation created by pension contributions. This expense has been exacerbated by lower pension fund returns coupled with increasing lifespans. The low returns in the funds and pension income that is paid for a longer period of time mean that sponsors are being required to make up shortfalls by special contributions between pension fund value and obligations. Many have taken advantage of their right to switch their DBPP to another form of pension that is less expensive, such as a DCPP. Example Lifespans in Canada are on the rise, and this creates pressure on the sponsors of DBPPs who are committed to providing a pension for life for their plan members. For instance, the Ontario Teacher\u2019s Pension Plan is a well-funded DBP that provides generous benefits to its members, teachers in Ontario. It reported that, in 1990, the plan had 13 pensioners aged 100 or more. In 2019, there were 135. In 1990, the Plan expected a pensioner to receive his pension for 25 years. In 2019, the expected years on pension were 32. This illustrates the increasing financial pressure on a plan as a result of longer lifespans.","title":"8.2.2.1 Defined benefit pension plan (DBPP)"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_8_Group_Retirement_and_Investment_Plans/#8222-defined-contribution-pension-plan-dcpp","text":"A defined contribution pension plan is also called a money purchase plan (MPP). A DCPP does not create the same financial burden on its sponsor as a DBPP because no set pension income is promised to members of a DCPP, so the sponsor is not responsible if a shortfall occurs. The members\u2019 pension is a result of: Amount of contributions made; How long contributions are made; Investment choice; and Performance of selected investments. Due to their reduced financial obligation for the sponsor, DCPPs are gaining market share over DBPPs. More sponsors are choosing to introduce a DCPP over a DBPP. Some DBPPs are being converted to DCPPs. The role of the DCPP sponsor is to: Set up a plan; Make their specified contribution to the plan; and Ensure continuing compliance with regulators. The DCPP administrator is responsible for the following: Educating all plan members about the plan\u2019s details. Providing members with investment information to make informed investment choices. The DCPP plan outlines the sponsor\u2019s minimum financial obligation, as a percentage of member income, for each plan member. There is no obligation to increase contributions over time. Sponsors can structure a DCPP to: Make participation optional; Require members to increase contributions over time; Restrict investment options available. Sponsor contributions are a tax-deductible expense and are not a taxable benefit to the plan member. The investments that will be made available to plan members are chosen by the sponsor or administrator. The sponsor or administrator may select the options for all members in particular circumstances. The investment options may include: Segregated funds; Mutual funds\u2014such as target-date funds (a form of mutual fund that becomes increasingly conservative as the date on which the funds are needed draws closer); and Guaranteed investment accounts. A member who monitors and manages his investments on an active basis may find the DCPP very advantageous because he can: Access available investment options; Switch among investments according to his needs and investment performance; and Tailor investment risk to his individual risk tolerance. Note that some plan members may find the investment choices difficult to grasp, leading to delayed decisions or a failure to even make decisions. The onus for investing to achieve their retirement savings goal is ultimately up to the group member despite the assistance provided by the sponsor or administrator.","title":"8.2.2.2 Defined contribution pension plan (DCPP)"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_8_Group_Retirement_and_Investment_Plans/#8223-group-life-income-fund-lif","text":"A group member with a DCPP is required to transfer his savings to an account that requires minimum withdrawals when he decides to receive his retirement income.

A GRRSP is fundamentally the same as an individual RRSP. Total yearly contributions to a group RRSP are restricted to the individual\u2019s RRSP deduction limit for the year (as provided by Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) in the latest Notice of Assessment). Example Reginald works as an assembler for an electronics manufacturer and earns $60,000 a year. He participates in the company\u2019s GRRSP\u2014both the employer and Reginald contribute 5% of his earnings to the plan. Total contributions to the GRRSP are $6,000 ((60,000 \u00d7 5%) \u00d7 2). Since Reginald\u2019s income was the same last year (i.e., $60,000) this year\u2019s RRSP deduction limit is $10,800 ( $60,000 \u00d7 18%). As Reginald\u2019s contribution to the company GRRSP was $6,000 for the year, he can contribute up to $4,800 ( $10,800 \u2013 $6,000) to his personal RRSP. A GRRSP does not usually allow the purchase of individual securities (i.e., stocks). GRRSPs have lower fees than an individual RRSP. Contributions made by the individual and the sponsor to the GRRSP vest immediately. Since their contributions will have vested whenever an employee leaves and become the property of the employee, a GRRSP can be costly for sponsors who have a high rate of staff turnover. The sponsor of a GRRSP incurs additional costs because their contributions are seen as additional salary paid to members. Payroll charges, such as Employment Insurance, are incurred on their contributions to the group plan. No financial commitment is made by GRRSP sponsors regarding an eventual pension for members. Members control their investments and contributions. They are ultimately responsible for creating their pension. Contributions are made through payroll deduction, making saving typically easier for members. Contributions made by the employer are taxable as income to the employee and are tax-deductible by the employer. The GRRSP sponsor\u2019s role is to collect and remit plan members\u2019 contributions. The sponsor does not have any other additional commitments to the plan. For this reason, GRRSPs may appeal to organizations with restricted resources available for plan administration. At plan maturity (i.e., the year in which the account owner turns 71 at the latest), savings accumulated in a GRRSP must be transferred into: A group or an individual RRIF; or An annuity, to continue tax deferral.","title":"8.2.2.4 Group registered retirement savings plan (GRRSP)"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_8_Group_Retirement_and_Investment_Plans/#8225-deferred-profit-sharing-plan-dpsp","text":"A deferred profit sharing plan is solely funded by employer contributions. Contributions to the plan arise from profits. Years with lower profits may see the company suspend contributions. Consequently, a DPSP is most suitable for organizations with stable profitability to ensure that contributions to the group plan can be made on a continual basis. Employer contributions and fees are tax deductible for the business and are not a taxable benefit to plan members. On federal and provincial government plans, employer contributions are not subject to payroll taxes. A tangible advantage of this plan is that contributions are tied to business profitability. Therefore, it can be used as a way to motivate employee performance. Note that the following employees cannot be DPSP members: Employees who own 10% or more of the shares of the company; and Employees related to the employer or a specified shareholder. Members can make partial withdrawals at any time. On the other hand, a plan sponsor can choose to limit withdrawals while the member is employed. The members choose from the available investment options chosen by the sponsor. The sponsor does not commit to providing a future pension. A DPSP is often used in combination with a GRRSP to which only members contribute. Employee contributions to the GRRSP are matched by employer contributions to the DPSP. DPSP contributions create a pension adjustment for members and thus reduce RRSP contribution room. This is also possible with a DCPP. The money saved in a DPSP can be transferred to a group or an individual RRIF, or an annuity, to continue tax deferral. Example Mark, a life insurance agent, has set up a meeting with a technology company to review their group savings and investment plan. The company set up their group plan, a DCPP, a few years ago, believing that the plan provided a way for the company to attract some of the best talent in their business, video gaming, without creating financial pressure on the company. However, since that plan was implemented, the company has grown astronomically. It is enormously profitable and expects revenues and profitability to continue to grow. There is no problem hiring; the company is sought out by applicants due to the strength of its product line and commitment to ongoing development. The objective of the company is changing from using a group plan to attract employees to using a group plan to reward employees. Retirement income is not top of mind for employees right now since their average age is 36. Example (Cont.) Mark proposes a DPSP for the company. The DPSP can easily be funded from corporate profits and it aligns well with the philosophy of this younger workforce who strongly believe company profits should be shared with those who help create those profits. Mark illustrates the benefits of the DPSP in comparison to the DCPP and any disadvantages. If the company proceeds, it will continue to offer its DCPP plan since the DCPP continues to provide dependability in case the fortunes of the company change, and the DPSP will start once it has been properly registered and a contract issued to the sponsor.","title":"8.2.2.5 Deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP)"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_8_Group_Retirement_and_Investment_Plans/#8226-group-registered-retirement-income-fund-rrif","text":"The sponsor may set up the group registered retirement income fund (RRIF) on behalf of the member to transition registered savings (in a GRRSP or DPSP) into pension income.

There is no maximum to the amount a member may withdraw; however, the plan requires a minimum annual withdrawal. The final date in which savings in the GRRSP or DPSP can be rolled into the RRIF is the end of the year when the plan member turns 71. It is most appropriate to set up a RRIF when retirement income is needed. This is due to the obligatory annual minimum withdrawals, with the exception of the first year.

Like other group plans: Sponsors are not required to contribute; all contributions are considered income; Sponsors are not responsible for providing a pension income to group members; A choice of investments is available. The group TFSA restricts contributions in the same that individual TFSAs are restricted. Each taxpayer is allotted an annual contribution limit (the dollar amount of contribution permitted for the year plus any unused contribution room from previous years). That sum is available for his group plan contribution, his individual plan contribution, or a combination of both. In other words, one limit for the total of all contributions. The annual limit cannot be exceeded without stiff penalties. A significant TFSA advantage is that contribution room is independent of other plans. Thus, the maximum contribution can be made to a TFSA and an RRSP. Typically, members benefit from lower investment fees in the group plan compared to individual plans. Contributions of the TFSA are not locked-in. Therefore, compared with other group plans, group plan members are provided with the flexibility to make tax-free withdrawals at any time. Example Darleen is the owner of a small, prestigious real estate firm that serves a niche market in a wealthy suburb. Her employees, all real estate agents, are at either end of the usual working age: either they are in their mid-to-late 60s or their mid-to-late 20s. They all earn significant six-figure incomes every year and have enjoyed high earnings for the past number of years. Darleen\u2019s financial success is a result of her agents\u2019 success, and she wants a group plan that will recognize employees\u2019 lengthy service without creating a significant tax burden for them. She knows that they have all made maximum RRSP contributions and have no available contribution room. They all pay tax at the highest marginal tax rate. Darleen needs to retain her long-standing employees. She knows from experience that the younger ones are not particularly loyal, but the older employees are. None of them plan to retire in the foreseeable future. A group TFSA does not have a maximum age for contributions so, on this basis, is a good fit for Darleen\u2019s older employees. Darleen creates a group TFSA for her more experienced employees on the basis of their years of service: those who have worked for ten years or more for Darleen are eligible to join.

The agent has a disclosure commitment to his client, the sponsor. The agent must notify the sponsor of the insurers that he places business with, predominantly the firm that is being recommended for the sponsor\u2019s policy. In Qu\u00e9bec, an agent who is bound by an exclusive contract with an insurer must disclose this fact to his sponsor-customer. The agent must notify the sponsor of any existing financing arrangements in place between the insurer and the agents. These arrangements can be viewed as a conflict of interest. Otherwise: The sponsor must be provided with the basic information regarding whether the agent is compensated by commission or a fee, and if a bonus or travel incentive exists; Specific dollar amounts must be provided if the sponsor asks for such details; The agent must also attain written approval from the sponsor if he receives an increase in compensation following the completion of the sale. The agent must be prepared with executive-level presentations of his recommendations that address: Plan specifications; Plan and investment recommendations; Pension credits and adjustments. The plan will specify when or under what conditions a group member is entitled to receive a full or partial pension. This has a direct bearing on the sponsor\u2019s cost for the plan.

The pension credit is a measure of the value of the benefit the member earned during the calendar year. The method an employer uses to calculate pension credits depends on the type of plan and its provisions. Pension credits for DBPPs, DCPPs, and DPSPs are calculated to determine a member\u2019s pension adjustment (PA) for the year. The PA reduces the amount that a member can contribute to an RRSP or a PRPP in the following year. Therefore, an RRSP or PRPP maximum contribution for a DBPP, DCPP, or DPSP member is: Contribution based on previous year\u2019s earned income (to annual maximum) - pension adjustment = this year\u2019s contribution limit Example Ahmad\u2019s maximum contribution limit for his RRSP this year is 18% of his previous year\u2019s earned income. His earned income for the previous year is $48,000, so his maximum RRSP contribution is $8,640 ( $48,000 \u00d7 18%). His pension adjustment for last year was $3,300 due to the contributions made to his DCPP at work. Therefore, he can contribute $5,340 ( $8,640 \u2013 $3,300) to his RRSP this year. Contribution room to an RRSP and PRPP can be increased by a pension adjustment reversal (PAR). If too much has been taken as a pension adjustment (PA) in a year - for instance, due to the plan member retiring or being terminated during the year - then the PA is recalculated. The difference between the full and the reduced PA is the PAR. A sponsor may increase benefits of a plan by retroactively increasing the benefit formula: This creates a past service pension adjustment (PSPA) for the member; A PSPA reduces RRSP contribution room; The administrator must calculate and report PSPAs.","title":"8.4.3 Pension credits and adjustments"},{"location":"segregated_funds/Chapter_8_Group_Retirement_and_Investment_Plans/#85-group-plan-documents","text":"Many documents must be provided to the pension authority in the jurisdiction in which the plan is being registered by the plan sponsor.

Whether the income starts partly depends on age at the time of transfer, since withdrawals may not be possible before a specified age. There are many conditions that must be carefully considered by the group member when a group plan-to-plan transfer is contemplated. An agreement transfer between DBPPs allows a member of a DBPP, who quits one plan to transfer the commuted value of his pension rights into the pension plan of the new employer and be recognized for years of service under the new plan. The terms of pension plans are not all the same. The value of one plan may not be equivalent to another plan, and a shortfall can arise. If so, the employee can contribute the sum needed to make up the shortfall in a lump sum within a specified deadline or pro-rate the amount of transfer. Plans may also differ as to when a pension is available. A group member would likely not want to transfer commuted value from one plan that permitted retirement on a full pension at age 62 to another plan, in which the full pension is provided at age 65. The member of a DCPP may be offered an entirely different set of investment options if he transfers to another pension plan. Even if he finds the new range of options unsuitable, the transfer cannot be undone. A transfer of accumulated funds to a locked-in retirement account (LIRA), or other self-administered plan, eliminates the problems associated with a group plan-to-plan switch. The account owner must be prepared to make investment decisions, from the universe of choices as he \u201cgoes it alone.\u201d For best results, he should be knowledgeable about the investments available to him and be prepared to monitor his account regularly.

However, it is essential that agents recognize that this chapter will not make them an authority on all matters pertaining to tax. At times, they will need to call on the expertise of an accountant to better serve their clients. 1.1 Taxation and The Practice of Life Insurance Agents \u00b6 In Canada, taxes are mandatory and levied on individuals, trusts and corporations by three levels of government: Federal; Provincial; Municipal. Governments use tax revenue to pay for such things as: Old Age Security (OAS) on the federal level; Health care and education on the provincial level; and Police and fire departments on the municipal level. 1.2 Canadian Tax System \u00b6 Federal and provincial governments collect income taxes and also raise money through what are collectively known as commodity taxes. These will each be addressed below. 1.2.1 Personal income tax \u00b6 Personal income is the tax levied on the total income of individuals net of deductions and credits. It is based on an individual\u2019s taxable income. Taxable income includes: Salaries and wages; Commissions; Rental Income; Net income from unincorporated businesses (for example, self-employment income); Investment returns such as interest, dividends and capital gains; and Certain benefits. 1.2.2 Federal income taxes \u00b6 Federal income taxes are based on \u201cgraduated\u201d tax rates. This means that the percentage of taxes paid increases as taxable income increases. Thus, an individual with a higher income will have a higher tax rate than an individual with a lower income. Currently, the top federal tax rate is 29%. Corporations pay either a 10.5% or 15% federal tax rate. With the exception of Qu\u00e9bec, which has a separate provincial tax return, the federal tax return for residents of the other provinces and territories includes provincial and territorial returns. The main criteria for filing a return are: Does the individual owe unpaid taxes? Is the individual required to contribute to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or the Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP)? Does the individual have taxable capital gains? - Source: Canada Revenue Agency. Canadian income tax rates for individuals \u2013 current and previous years. [online]. Revised February 19, 2019.

Example Simon has a taxable income of $175,000. According to the federal tax tables, Simon (a resident of a province other than Qu\u00e9bec) will pay $31,114 on the first $150,473 ( $7,280 + $9,949 + $13,885). To determine the amount of additional tax he needs to pay, he calculates: $175,000 \u2013 $150,473 = $24,527 He multiplies $24,527 by 29% to determine the tax on his taxable income over $150,473 (that is $7,113). He then adds the amounts of $7,113 and $31,114 to determine his total federal tax of $38,227. 1.2.3 Provincial income taxes \u00b6 Individuals also have to pay provincial income taxes. The criteria may vary from province to province, but they are generally asked to provide information from their federal returns including: Taxable income; Net income; Dividend income; Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP) contributions; Employment Insurance (EI) premiums; Medical expenses; and Donations and gifts. The provincial forms are included with the Income tax package, except for Qu\u00e9bec, which has its own. Provincial income tax rates vary from province to province. The provinces have also graduated tax rates for individuals. Source: Canada Revenue Agency. Canadian income tax rates for individuals \u2013 current and previous years. [online].

PEI also charges a 10% surtax on provincial tax exceeding $12,500. Yukon surtax was eliminated in 2015. 1.2.4 Commodity taxes \u00b6 Commodity taxes include: GST (goods and services tax), PST (provincial sales tax), and in provinces which combine the two, the HST (harmonized sales tax). HST is not charged on all purchases. Items as basic foods, prescription drugs, and insurance premiums are exempt from HST. HST combines GST and PST, and only exists in some provinces. In Qu\u00e9bec, the Qu\u00e9bec Sales Tax (QST) follows the same rules as GST. The QST is not harmonized and is a separate tax. Excise tax are charged on such things as fuel-ineffcient vehiclies, air conditioners designed for use in automoblies and gasoline. They also include excise duties on alcohol and tobacco products. Up-to-date information on GST, HST and PST can be found on the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) website. While insurance premiums are exempt from HST, some provinces can charge a premium tax on of certain types of insurance including group insurance. These will be covered in chapter 3. 1.2.5 Withholding taxes \u00b6 Withholding taxes are a prepayment of taxes owing. 1.2.5.1 Domestic withholding tax \u00b6 When an employee earns a salary, the employer typically \u201cwithholds\u201d a portion of taxes the employee would normally owe, and submits that amount to the government on behalf of the employee. Withholding taxes also apply to items such as RRSP withdrawals: 10% (5% for Qu\u00e9bec*) on withdrawals $5,000 or less; 20% (10% for Qu\u00e9bec*) on withdrawals from $5,001 to $15,000; 30% (15% for Qu\u00e9bec*) on withdrawals greater than $15,000. *In Qu\u00e9bec, there is an additional amount of 15% that will be withheld by financial institutions and insurance companies. This amount will be paid to Revenu Qu\u00e9bec. Example Jean-Marc, a resident of Qu\u00e9bec, withdrew $20,000 from his RRSP. Based on the amount he withdrew from his RRSP, the 15% rate for Qu\u00e9bec would apply, so the tax would withhold 15% of $20,000 = $3,000. Therefore, Jean-Marc will receive $20,000 - $3,000 = $17,000. According to Jean-Marc\u2019s overall income, if the amount withheld is too high/low, any amount will be determined when he files his tax return that year. 1.2.5.2 Foreign withholding tax \u00b6 Individuals may be subject to foreign withholding tax if they receive dividends from shares of foreign corporations. As a result of treaties, signatory countries waive or significantly reduce the withholding tax paid on income earned on assets held within registered savings or income plans (i.e., RRSPs, RRIFs). There is no mechanism for the refund of withholding taxes pertaining to dividends on foreign securities held in a tax-free savings account (TFSA). Example Chris owns shares in several U.S. dividend-paying companies. He knows that there will be a default withholding tax rate of 30%. If he files the right form, he will be eligible for a preferential rate of 15%. He may minimize the Canadian taxes otherwise owing on this U.S. dividend income by claiming a foreign tax credit when he files his Canadian tax return. 1.2.5.3 Withholding taxes on assets owned by non-residents \u00b6 Administered on assets owned by non-residents or payments received by non-resident. Includes items such as annuity payments and insurance policies. 1.3 Definition of a self-assessed Tax System \u00b6 Canada has a \u201cself-assessed\u201d tax system \u2013 Canadians report their own income and file their own taxes accordingly. A self-assessed system doesn\u2019t mean that income tax payment is optional, but that individuals are the ones filling their tax returns, not the government Any taxes owing are due by the tax return filing deadline date. As such, taxpayers should send payment for any taxes owing to Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) when filing their tax return. Within a couple of weeks of filing, a notice of assessment is sent to the taxpayer confirming either an amount owing or a refund. If there is a refund owing by the CRA, payment will be made either by cheque or a direct deposit to the tax payer\u2019s account. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) regularly audits or inspects a number of individual and corporate tax returns in order to verify legitimacy. Some audits or inspections are performed at random, others may be due to a suspicious or excessive claim. The CRA can audit up to three years after the notice of assessment is sent (corporations other than Canadian-controlled private corporations and mutual fund trusts up to four years). No time limit for fraud and a blatant disregard of tax rules. Individuals are required to retain all tax-related information for 6 years. For example, an individual who files taxes in 2015 should retain those records until at least 2021, in case he or she is audited in a subsequent year. 1.3.1 Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) audits \u00b6 Each year the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) audits or inspects a number of individual and corporate income tax returns, HST/GST returns as well as excise tax, duties and payroll records. Most taxpayers earn salaries, wages or are pensioners. Their incomes are easily verified by comparing the information they file with the CRA with the information employers and financial institutions provide. Taxpayers who are in compliance should not be concerned about such reviews. The CRA will generally take more care to review individuals who have business or professional income, as well as corporations and trusts. 1.3.1.1 Types of Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) Audits \u00b6 According to the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA), there are four ways of selecting files for audit: - Source: Canada Revenue Agency. Audits. [online]. Revised September 5, 2018. [Consulted May 15, 2019]. http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/gncy/lrt/lrn-mr-eng.html If the CRA selects a return for an audit, an auditor will review the individual\u2019s, corporation\u2019s or trust\u2019s return, information the CRA has on file, such as the taxpayer\u2019s returns and financial statements and it may request specific records from the individual. When the CRA completes the audit the auditor will issue a notice of assessment or reassessment if there are adjustments to the return. If a taxpayer disagrees with the notice of a reassessment, they can try to resolve the issues that led to a reassessment at a CRA tax services office. If the taxpayer has no success at the tax services office level, a notice of objection can be prepared. This will lead to a review by the CRA\u2019s Appeals office. Beyond that appeal may be made to the courts. 1.3.1.2 Statutory limits on audits \u00b6 The normal reassessment period for most taxpayers is three years after the CRA sends its notice of assessment. The exceptions are mutual fund trusts and corporations other than Canadian-controlled private corporations for which the normal assessment period is four years. After this period, the CRA is barred from commencing an audit. Similarly, a taxpayer cannot ask to have a file reopened to claim a refund. In the event of fraud, gross negligence or a conscious disregard of tax rules, there is no time limit. 1.3.2 Retention of records \u00b6 The Income Tax Act requires that taxpayers keep all records to verify information contained in filed tax returns for a period of six years from the end of the taxation year relating to the records. 1.4 General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) \u00b6 GAAR is intended to prevent individuals and corporations from engaging in transactions that have no other purpose than to provide an inappropriate tax benefit. The CRA definition of tax benefit under the Income Tax Act is: \u201ca reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax or other amount payable under this Act or an increase in a refund of tax or other amount under this Act\u201d. The CRA discourages and prevents excessive tax avoidance through several strategies: Regular reviews for potential tax avoidance issues; Monitoring current tax avoidance trends such as tax shelters; and New legislation from the Department of Finance aimed at preventing tax evasion and excessive tax avoidance. For more information on tax avoidance consult the page: Tax Avoidance on the CRA website at http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/gncy/lrt/vvw-eng.html . 1.5 Filing Tax Returns \u00b6 Both individuals and corporations must file taxes before the respective deadlines. Individuals who are U.S. citizens or hold a Green Card also must file a U.S. tax return. 1.5.1 Fiscal year and tax reporting year-end \u00b6 Individuals: File T1 tax returns based on a calendar year; Taxes are calculated (and tax returns are filed) on a calendar-year basis; Year end is always December 31; December 31 also applies to individuals who are self-employed (the CRA categorizes self-employment income as business, professional, commission, farming or fishing income). Corporations: The \u201cfiscal year\u201d is a corporation\u2019s reporting period. It is at most 12 months but can be shorter in a corporation\u2019s first year of operation; Can choose any date for the tax-year end; Tax return must be filed within 6 months exactly from the corporation\u2019s tax year end date; Members of partnerships generally use the December 31 reporting year to report their share of partnership income or losses on the T1 return. Source: Canada Revenue Agency. When to file your corporation income tax return. http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/crprtns/rtrn/whn/menu-eng.html . It should be noted that some flexibility was allowed in 2020 due to the global pandemic. 1.5.2 Canada and the United States (U.S.) \u00b6 In Canada, taxes are based on residency. In the U.S., taxes are based on citizenship. All U.S. citizens, regardless of where they live and the source of the income, are required to file a U.S. tax return. Many individuals live in one country but have income from another. Others may have dual citizenship or income from both countries. Tax treaties between Canada and U.S. reduce the possibility of double taxation on income earned. Canadians who have worked or lived in the U.S. and continue to hold assets in the form of retirement savings may need to withdraw these funds. This is a complex process with possible options to transfer to RRSPs. For example, Sam has lived and worked in Winnipeg for the past 20 years. He files his tax return every year before the tax filing deadline. Sam is also a U.S. citizen. Even though he has not worked in the U.S. for 20 years, he has to file a U.S. tax return to reporting the income earned in Canada. However, Sam can claim a tax credit on his U.S. tax return equivalent to income tax paid in Canada. The tax credit reduced the amount of U.S. income tax payable. 1.6 Types of Income \u00b6 A tax return has sections for: Total income; Net income; and Taxable income. 1.6.1 Total income \u00b6 Total income for each calendar year must be reported on a tax return, and includes: Employment and pension income; Disability and child care benefits; EI, CPP, OAS; Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) or Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) income; Tax-exempt payments include: Inheritances; Lottery winnings; Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) benefits; Strike pay; Life insurance death benefit. Note: For an exhaustive list consult the General Income Tax and Benefit Guide on the CRA website. 1.6.2 Net income \u00b6 Net income = total income - specific deductions Net income begins with total income and lists the items, expenses and contributions that are deducted from it. Common deductions include: RRSP or RPP contributions; Child care expenses; Disability support; Business investment loss; Moving expenses; Support payments excluding most child support payments; Carrrying charged and interest expenses Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions on self-employed earnings; Social benefits repayments. Required on provincial/territorial tax returns and is used for calculating child tax credit and GST/HST credit. 1.6.3 Taxable Income \u00b6 Taxable income is net income after additional specific deductions. Specific additional deductions include: Canadian Forces personnel and police deduction; Employee home relocation load deduction; Security options deduction; Other payments deduction; Limited partnership losses of other years; Non-capital losses of other years; Capital gains deduction; Northern residents deduction; and Additional deductions; Taxable income may be required on provincial/territorial tax form and is used for calculating federal tax. 1.7 Marginal and Average Tax Rates \u00b6 Marginal tax rates (MTR) is often described as the amount of taxes owing on an each additional dollar of income. Tax rates are divided into tax \u201cbrackets\u201d \u2013 as income increases, additional income is taxed at increasing rates. MTR = federal tax rate + provincial tax rate Example Margaret has taxable income of $80,000. The federal marginal tax rate for taxable income over $48,630, but not more than $97,069, is 20.5%. Margaret lives in Nova Scotia where the provincial marginal tax rate applicable on income between $59,180 and $93,000 is 16.67%. So her combined marginal tax rate is 20.5% + 16.67% or 37.17%. Average tax rate is the percentage of each dollar of income paid as tax. Average tax rate = tax paid / income earned An individual\u2019s average tax rate will always be less than or equal to his or her marginal tax rate. Example Cont. Margaret would pay $7,280 in federal tax on her first $48,535 of income and $6,450 (or 20.5% on the amount exceeding $48,535, i.e., $31,465) on the remainder for a total of $13,730. In addition she would pay provincial tax of $7,025 on her first $59,180 of income and $3,471 on the remaining $20,280 or taxable income for a total provincial tax of $10,495. Combined, her federal and provincial taxes will therefore total $24,225. Dividing this amount by her $80,000 taxable income gives an average tax rate of 30.3%. 1.8 Difference Between Deductions and Credits \u00b6 Deductions and credits are NOT the same, but both help to reduce the amount of tax an individual must pay. Deductions: Deductions reduce the income that is used for calculating taxes owing; One of the most common income tax deductions is the RRSP deduction; Every dollar contributed to an RRSP reduces net income accordingly. Credits: Federal and provincial tax credits reduce federal and provincial taxes owing. In other words, tax credits reduce tax payable. For example, each taxpayer claims $13,229 (2020) as a personal amount, while people 65 years of age or older with income below $38,508 claim an additional age amount of $7,637 (this amount is adjusted downward according to income). The federal non-refundable tax credit rate is 15%. Provinces also have a system of credits that reduce provincial tax. Refundable and non-refundable credits: Some credits are refundable. For example, GST/HST tax credit is a tax-free quarterly payment to low/modest income individuals/families; Most credits are non-refundable. Meaning that they cannot reduce tax payable below zero and if the credit cannot be used it will be lost. Some of the most common tax credits include: Labour sponsored funds tax credit is available at 15% of the contribution up to a maximum of $750; and Pension income tax credit is available up to a maximum of $2,000 for those reporting eligible pension, superannuation or annuity payments. 1.9 Tax Reporting in The Year of Death of a Person \u00b6 When someone dies, a legal representative is responsible for administering the estate of the deceased. They include specific responsibilities pertaining to the CRA and Services Canada - such as: Provide CRA with the deceased\u2019s date of death; Cease or transfer certain benefit payments (such as CPP); and Filing tax returns and making sure taxes owing are paid. For up-to-date information regarding tax reporting in the year of death, consult the CRA online document: What to do following a death: http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/rc4111/rc4111-13e.pdf 1.9.1 Rules that a legal representative must comply with following the death of a person \u00b6 A legal representative is responsible for administering the deceased\u2019s estate and carrying out the distribution of the estate assets as stated in the deceased\u2019s will. The legal representative must: Provide the CRA with the date of death of the deceased; Cease or transfer, in some cases, certain benefits the deceased was receiving. If someone dies between January 1 and October 31, their final tax return is due on April 30 of the following year. If someone dies between November 1 and December 31, the final tax return is due within 6 months of the date of death. If someone dies after December 31 but on or before the due date for the return, generally April 30, the due date for filing the deceased\u2019s and the surviving spouse or common-law partner's return is six months after the date of death. If the deceased was self-employed or was married to a person who is self-employed, slightly different due dates apply. The tax return of the surviving spouse who lived with the deceased has the same filing dates as the deceased rather than the April 30 th filing date. However, any tax owing must be paid by April 30 to avoid interest charges. The legal representative is responsible under the Income Tax Act for the following: Filing all required returns for the deceased; making sure all taxes owing are paid; letting the beneficiaries know which, if any, of the amounts they receive from the estate are taxable; and obtaining a clearance certificate to certify that all amounts owing to the CRA have been paid. Any fees paid to the legal representative or the administrator are reported on a T4 slip, unless included in that person\u2019s business income. For up-to-date information regarding tax reporting in the year of death, consult the CRA website and online document: Preparing Returns for Deceased Person 2013. 1.9.2 Definition of probate \u00b6 Probate is the process through which a will is certified to be the deceased\u2019s last valid will and through which an estate\u2019s executor, in turn, receives approval from a court to obtain and distribute assets. Whether a will must go through probate depends on specifics and varies among provinces. Probate fees (with the exception of Quebec) are administered based on the size of the estate \u2013 i.e., the fair market value (FMV) of the assets passing through the will. Probate fees vary considerably by province. Life insurance death benefits paid directly to a named beneficiary (i.e., the beneficiary is NOT the estate) are not subject to probate. Qu\u00e9bec does not require a notarial will to be probated. However, wills prepared by an attorney and witnessed must be probated. 1.9.3 Estate taxation \u00b6 A deceased individual\u2019s estate is taxed based on the principle of \u201cdeemed disposition\u201d. In other words, for tax purposes, taxes are administered as if the individual had sold all his or her assets on the day of death at fair market value. 1.9.3.1 Spousal deferrals \u00b6 \"Spouse\" means a married spouse, a common-law partner or a partner, including a same-sex partner. An exception to this is the \u201cspousal rollover\u201d provision that permits assets to be transferred to the surviving spouse at the adjusted cost base of the deceased and obtained at the same tax cost. Under the spousal rollover provision, the deceased will not be taxed on the asset. Ownership will roll over to the surviving spouse. Only upon the death of the surviving spouse will the tax liability be assessed and become owing. The adjusted cost base (ACB) refers to the cost of an asset for tax purposes. It is generally equal to the sum of the purchase price, plus expenses incurred to make the purchase, plus expenses incurred to sell the asset less the sum of any capital distribution received. Example Louis died with an RRSP valued at $300,000. Under CRA rules, his RRSP can be transferred directly to an RRSP registered in the name of his wife Nancy with no tax consequences. Similarly, his stock portfolio can be transferred to her with no reporting of capital gains for Louis. In the case of the stock portfolio, Nancy\u2019s adjusted cost base (ACB) is the deceased\u2019s ACB, so any taxes on gains may be deferred until her death or until she actually disposes of the portfolio. 1.9.3.2 Rollover to dependent children or grandchildren \u00b6 The fair market value of an RRSP is generally included in the deceased\u2019s income for the year of death. However, if an amount is paid from the RRSP to a financially dependent child or grandchild, the amount reported on the deceased\u2019s final return is reduced by that amount and a T4RSP slip is issued to the child or grandchild who then reports it as income. Financial dependence would require the child or grandchild to have income less than the personal amount. If the beneficiary is a dependant of the deceased due to mental or physical infirmity, the RRSP proceeds may be rolled over, tax-free, into an RRSP or a registered disability savings plan (RDSP) in the beneficiary\u2019s name up to his available RDSP contribution room. Finally, a dependent child, or grandchild, under the age of 18 is entitled to a rollover of the RRSP refund of premiums to an annuity for which the child is the sole beneficiary. The annuity must be for a number of years not exceeding 18 minus the age of the child at the time of its acquisition. 1.10 Understand How Individuals Are Taxed \u00b6 Employers deduct federal and provincial tax from each employee\u2019s gross income and submit to CRA on behalf of the employee. The amount deducted is a credit against the employee\u2019s taxes otherwise payable. If due to the impact of deductions and tax credits, the tax otherwise payable turns out to be less than the amount deducted the taxpayer will receive a refund when he or she files a tax return; Employers also deduct Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or, in Qu\u00e9bec, Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan (QPP), contributions and Employment Insurance (EI) premiums and, in Qu\u00e9bec, Qu\u00e9bec Parental Insurance Plan premiums. Deductions can also be made for employee contributions to an RRSP, registered pension plans (RPP), items such as retirement savings plan contributions, and taxable benefits including parking, cell phone and internet use; Telework deductions in connection with COVID-19: An employee can deduct from employment income home office rent and the cost of supplies that were consumed directly in the performance of the duties (\u201cHome Office Expenses\u201d), if these outlays by the em-ployee were required by a contract of employment. The principal condition for the deduction of expenses in respect of a work space at home, such as rent, util-ities and maintenance costs, is that the employee must principally perform (i.e. more than 50% of) his work from that work space for more than six months out of the year. To claim a deduction for Home Office Expenses, the employee must file a Form T2200 with the employee\u2019s personal tax return. In the context of COVID-19, an employer may reimburse an employee for the purchase of personal comput-er equipment up to $500, and such reimbursement will not be a taxable benefit for the employee. For up-to-date information on the Payroll Deductions Online Calculator (PDOC), payroll tables and TD1s, consult: http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/pyrll/tbls-eng.html . 1.10.1 Working on commission (Employment Commissions) \u00b6 Salaried employees typically have very few options available for deductions related to employment expenses. Commissioned employees (as opposed to salaried employees) are usually entitled to more deductions such as those related to motor vehicle and home office expenses. 1.10.2 Self-employed \u00b6 Self-employed individuals can deduct business expenses such as: Insurance premiums; Interest; Management and administration fees; Maintenance and repairs; Rent; Property taxes; Travel and fuel costs; Professional fees \u2013 for example, legal or accounting services; Salaries and wages; and Business-out-of-home costs. Example Cho runs a painting business out of his apartment where he uses one room as a studio which amounts to around 20% of his living space of his home. Therefore, he can deduct from his gross income 20% of his electricity, insurance, heat, maintenance, mortgage interest, property taxes and other expenses. If Cho purchases new painting tools or furniture for his studio, he can claim a deduction based on the type of asset. Special rules exist to determine the amounts which can be deducted each year based on the capital cost allowance class that the asset type falls under. 1.10.3 Business owners \u00b6 Owners of corporations can pay themselves in salary, or dividends (which may result in a more favourable tax treatment) or a combination of both. Example Brenda\u2019s corporation had $50,000 of profit after-tax last year. This money is now available to buy new equipment to expand the business. Had she been a sole proprietor, she would have had fewer funds after tax for expansion. Depending on which province the corporation operates in and assuming it is eligible for the small business deduction it will have a tax rate between 11% and 23%; the rate in several provinces is 15.5%. 1.10.4 Trusts \u00b6 Trusts are legal structures which are also subject to taxation. Types of trusts include: Testamentary trust: Created on the day a person dies. For example, Amos is a widower with two children ages 4 and 8. He changes his will to establish a testamentary trust with his children as beneficiaries and two of his brothers as trustees; Prior to 2016, testamentary trusts were taxed federally using the same graduated tax rates as individuals. However, following a change, for 2016 and subsequent years, this is limited to 36 months for estates, after which it will be subject to the top marginal rate. Graduated tax rates continue for trusts whose beneficiaries are eligible for the Disability Tax Credit. Inter vivos trust: Created during an individual\u2019s lifetime, taxed at the highest MTR at a rate of 33%. RRSP accounts and segregated funds are trusts held by a trustee (the institution that holds the assets) for the benefit of a beneficiary. REITs (Real Estate Income Trusts) hold real estate property for the benefit of unit holders. Mutual funds \u2013 most mutual funds are trusts (few are structured as corporations). For up-to-date information on Trusts consult Types of Trusts on the CRA website: http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/pyrll/tbls-eng.html . 1.10.5 Understanding how income taxes can be deferred or avoided \u00b6 Tax evasion is illegal. It can mean failing to report all income or making fictitious deductions. It is perfectly legal to avoid or defer some taxes (tax avoidance) through proper financial planning, taking advantage of government programs or using strategies to minimize the tax burden. Tax planning is an important part of financial planning to maximize tax reductions. TFSA, RRSP and RESP accounts are government-approved programs that provide tax-sheltered investment growth. The use of these programs would thus result in lower taxes. Example 1 Juan wants to start saving for retirement. By using an RRSP, he lowers the amount of income tax he pays in the current year. His income within the plan grows tax deferred, and he only has to pay tax when he withdraws funds or receives payments from an RRIF or a registered annuity. Individuals can contribute up to 18% of the previous year\u2019s earned income to a maximum of $27,230 (for 2020). Last year Juan had a salary income of $75,000. This amount is Juan\u2019s total earned income. His contribution room for this year is 18% of $75,000 or $13,500. He decides to open a plan and contributes $13,500. He will be able to deduct that amount from his income when he completes his tax return for the current year. This will reduce his taxable income by $13,500. Some investments are taxed more favourably than others. For example, an individual can invest in equities to enjoy the preferential tax treatment of capital gains. Example 2 Five years ago, Janine bought shares in a technology company for $10,000. The company has not paid dividends and the investment currently valued at $50,000. If Janine sells the shares now, she will pay tax on the taxable portion of her $40,000 capital gain, less transaction costs. Taxes can be deferred through the choice of investments. The tax an individual pays on interest, capital gains and dividends from Canadian public companies are different and vary by marginal tax rate and by province. Interest income is taxed in the year earned or accrued. Capital gains, however, are taxable on disposition. 1.11 When to Refer to a Tax Expert \u00b6 Life insurance agents should have a basic working level of taxation knowledge, but are NOT experts in all areas of taxation. There are many complex circumstances that require an advanced level of tax knowledge, where the agent should refer the client to a tax specialist such as a: Tax accountant; Tax lawyer. Example Alfred, Anthea, Roberto and Fatima are shareholders in a small advertising agency. Alfred is age 60, Anthea is age 40 while Roberto and Fatima are in their 30s. Their insurance agent recommends life insurance and disability insurance such that if one of the four should die or become disabled there will be funds available to buy out his or her interests. The agent has therefore brought accountants and a tax lawyer to advise, in the case of this agency, on whether the insurance should be owned by the corporation or by the individuals.","title":"Chapter 1 Taxation Framework"},{"location":"taxation/Chapter_1_Taxation_Framework/#chapter-1-taxation-framework","text":"Insurance agents should have a basic knowledge of the Canadian tax system to better serve their clients.

With the exception of Qu\u00e9bec, which has a separate provincial tax return, the federal tax return for residents of the other provinces and territories includes provincial and territorial returns.

It can mean failing to report all income or making fictitious deductions. It is perfectly legal to avoid or defer some taxes (tax avoidance) through proper financial planning, taking advantage of government programs or using strategies to minimize the tax burden. Tax planning is an important part of financial planning to maximize tax reductions. TFSA, RRSP and RESP accounts are government-approved programs that provide tax-sheltered investment growth. The use of these programs would thus result in lower taxes. Example 1 Juan wants to start saving for retirement. By using an RRSP, he lowers the amount of income tax he pays in the current year. His income within the plan grows tax deferred, and he only has to pay tax when he withdraws funds or receives payments from an RRIF or a registered annuity. Individuals can contribute up to 18% of the previous year\u2019s earned income to a maximum of $27,230 (for 2020). Last year Juan had a salary income of $75,000. This amount is Juan\u2019s total earned income. His contribution room for this year is 18% of $75,000 or $13,500. He decides to open a plan and contributes $13,500. He will be able to deduct that amount from his income when he completes his tax return for the current year. This will reduce his taxable income by $13,500. Some investments are taxed more favourably than others. For example, an individual can invest in equities to enjoy the preferential tax treatment of capital gains. Example 2 Five years ago, Janine bought shares in a technology company for $10,000. The company has not paid dividends and the investment currently valued at $50,000. If Janine sells the shares now, she will pay tax on the taxable portion of her $40,000 capital gain, less transaction costs. Taxes can be deferred through the choice of investments. The tax an individual pays on interest, capital gains and dividends from Canadian public companies are different and vary by marginal tax rate and by province.

However, if an individual has invested money in investment funds, buys and sells shares or property, they may receive investment income. 2.1 Taxation of Investment Income \u00b6 Investment returns are taxed in different ways, depending on how the returns are generated: Interest \u2013 100% inclusion (taxed the same as regular income); Capital gains \u2013 50% inclusion rates (only half the capital gain is taxed - this is called the taxable capital gain); For example, if an individual has $1,000 in capital gains, only $500 is subject to taxation (at the individual\u2019s MTR) and the other $500 is not; Dividends \u2013 dividends from Canadian corporations enjoy preferential tax treatment via the dividend tax credit. If investment income is earned in a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP), a registered pension plan (RPP) or a deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP) all income is taxable including the capital invested as the capital invested reduces the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income. If the investment is in a registered education savings plan (RESP), only the growth in the plan is fully taxable when the funds are withdrawn. This is because when the investment was made it would have been with after-tax dollars. Note that with registered plans the taxation of the income earned on the investment (the growth) is tax deferred until such time that it is withdrawn. Thus, the income does not have to be declared until it is withdrawn. Agents need to understand how investment income is taxed because it will help them develop insurance and investment strategies. 2.1.1 Accrued interest \u00b6 Interest income is fully taxable in the year that it is received. Some investments do not pay out the interest income annually but instead, let it accrue until maturity. Even though the interest income is not paid out, it is taxable annually, as though it had been paid, and must be reported. This is true for investments in all accounts except registered accounts, for which the taxation of income is tax-deferred until it is withdrawn. At such time, the income plus the principal invested is fully taxable. Example Madeleine bought a $5,000 three-year Canada Savings Bond that compounds interest rather than paying it annually. She received a tax slip for the $50.15 in interest the bond accrued last year. She must report this amount even though she did not receive it. She will not pay tax on that amount when it is paid to her at the bond\u2019s maturity. This way, there will not be any double taxation. 2.1.2 Dividend income from Canadian corporations \u00b6 Dividend income from Canadian corporations is taxed at a lower rate than interest income. In other words, they get a preferential tax treatment. Dividends are paid out to shareholders from the after-tax profits of a corporation. The amount paid to the shareholder has already been taxed in the hands of the corporation. The shareholder then needs to pay tax on the dividend. This leads to a situation of double taxation because the government has already collected corporate taxes on the amount. To mitigate this situation the government requires the taxpayer to report the gross-up amount of the dividend received. This is the taxable amount and reflects the amount of pre-tax income the corporation is presumed to have earned. The amount of the gross-up depends on whether the dividend is an eligible dividend, those received from public companies, or a non-eligible dividend, those received from private corporations. Eligible dividends such as those paid by public companies are \u201cgrossed-up\u201d by a higher amount (38%) than non-eligible dividends (sometimes called ordinary dividends) (15%). The taxable amount however is reduced by a federal dividend tax credit for eligible dividends (15.0198%) or ordinary dividends (9.0301%). The provinces each have varying dividend tax credits. Similar provincial tax credits are available for both eligible and non-eligible tax credits. The rates vary depending on the province. A dividend paid by a Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) from its small business deduction (SBD) income or investment income is an ordinary dividend and its treatment is slightly different. Example Douglas received a T5 tax statement from the company whose shares he owned, indicating: The actual dividends received were $7,870.00; The taxable dividends were $10,860.60; The federal dividend tax credit was $1,631.24. Douglas wanted to confirm that the dividends are in fact eligible dividends. To do so, he multiplied $7,870 by 138% and got $10,860.60. He multiplied that by 15.0198% and got $1,631.24. Douglas\u2019s federal marginal tax rate is 22%. He calculates that he will pay $2,389.33 in tax on the \u201cgrossed-up\u201d taxable dividend, which when reduced by the $1,631.24 dividend tax credit will amount to $758.09. As a result, he will have $7,111.91 after tax. 2.1.2.1 Other types of dividends \u00b6 In addition to the dividends discussed above, an agent may run into terms such as Capital Dividends and the Capital Dividend Account (CDA). The CDA is a theoretical tax account which a private corporation uses to keep track of the tax-free amounts it receives. Amounts received such as the tax-free death benefit from a life insurance policy where the corporation has been named a beneficiary, less the policy\u2019s ACB, or non-taxable portion of capital gains are credited to the CDA. The corporation can then distribute the amounts in the CDA to shareholders as tax-free capital dividends. Example Martina is president of a small corporation whose shares are owned by her children. The corporation is the beneficiary of a term insurance policy on her life. Martina dies and the proceeds of the policy are paid out to the corporation and applied to the capital dividend account. They are distributed tax-free to the shareholders. 2.1.3 Dividend income from foreign source \u00b6 Dividend income received from foreign sources does not receive the dividend tax credit. They are taxed the same way as interest income. 2.1.4 Withholding taxes on foreign income \u00b6 Investors who receive dividends from foreign corporations may have taxes withheld when paid. The amount of withholding tax depends on the foreign country. Tax treaties between Canada and most other countries help offset the tax liability on the dividend by way of a foreign tax credit, which credits the withholding tax already paid in the foreign country against the tax owing. As a result of these tax treaties, most countries waive withholding taxes on income paid from registered savings plans such as an RRSP or RRIF. However, there is no mechanism for refunding withholding taxes pertaining to investments in a TFSA. Investors should consider the potential impact of withholding taxes on dividends paying foreign investments in their TFSA. 2.1.5 Capital gains \u2013 Disposition of capital assets \u00b6 A capital gain occurs when an investor (individual or corporation) sells \u201ccapital property\u201d at a price higher than its adjusted cost base (ACB), resulting in a capital gain for tax purposes. A sale of a capital property may also result in a capital loss if the property is sold for a value less than its ACB. Currently, 50% of capital gains are taxable (i.e., capital gains have a 50% \u201cinclusion rate\u201d). Taxable capital gain = 50% \u00d7 (proceeds of disposition - ACB) For example, if an investor purchases shares in a corporation for $5,000 and later sells those shares for $8,000, then the investor has a $3,000 capital gain and a taxable capital gain of only $1,500. If the investor was in a 30% MTR, the taxes owing on the $3,000 capital gain would be $450 (30% of the taxable capital gain of $1,500). Capital property is any property held outside of a registered account which the taxpayer invests with the view of making income. Capital property includes cottages, rental properties, building and equipment used in a business, stocks and bonds, mutual funds, segregated funds, etc., held outside a tax deferral account. Please note that a capital gain is triggered by a sale of the capital property. While the capital property is being held by the owner, no capital gain is triggered although the capital property might be appreciating in value. Accrued capital gains are not taxed annually. Only realized capital gain on the disposition of a capital property is subject to tax. Hence, investment in capital property may provide a means of tax deferral to an investor. A capital property need not be sold, to trigger a capital gains tax. A deemed sale occurs if an individual exchanges one property for another; gifts a property; if the property is stolen or destroyed; a person emigrates from Canada; and upon the death of the property owner. Personal property The disposition of personal property does not trigger a capital gain or loss. Personal property is a property owned by a person and used for his or her sole pleasure without intention of making any income on the property such as a boat or an automobile; household furniture; clothing; etc. The CRA assumes that each of these properties has an ACB of $1,000 and holds that most personal property depreciates over time. Example Andreas holds a garage sale to sell CDs, videos, clothing, toys and a table and chair set. She does not need to report her income from the garage sale. Listed personal property - The exceptions to this rule are listed as personal property and include prints, etchings, drawings, paintings, sculptures, or other works of art; jewellery; rare folios, manuscripts or books; stamps; coins. - Net gains (and losses) on these must be reported on tax returns, although losses on listed personal property may only be deducted against gains from listed personal property. 2.1.6 Rules pertaining to capital losses \u00b6 Similarly, a capital loss occurs when an investor sells a capital property for a price less than its ACB. Example If an investor purchases shares in a corporation for $5,000 and paid a commission of $150. The investor\u2019s ACB is therefore, $5,150. The investor later sells those shares for $3,000, after commissions. The investor has a capital loss of $2,150. His allowable capital loss is $1,075. Capital losses also have a 50% inclusion rate \u2013 this portion is called the \u201callowable\u201d capital loss. 2.1.6.1 Offsets, carry forwards, and carry backs \u00b6 Allowable capital losses must be applied against taxable capital gains for the current year to offset all or part of the gain. If loss still remains, it becomes the taxpayer\u2019s net capital loss, which is the difference between the allowable capital loss and taxable capital gain for that year. A taxpayer can carry back the net capital loss to reduce or eliminate capital gains in any of the three immediately prior tax years or carry the loss forward into a future year. When carrying forward net capital losses from previous years to be used in a current year, the taxpayer needs to be cautious of the fact that the capital gains inclusion rate may have changed and thus would need to make an adjustment. In the Notice of Assessment, CRA provides the adjusted net capital losses that are carried forward and which may be applied against capital gains in the current year. When carrying back net capital losses, no adjustments are needed. At death, capital losses may be applied against all sources of income of the deceased and not just to capital gains. 2.1.6.2 Superficial losses \u00b6 Active investors in the stock markets regularly review their trades for the year and toward the end of the year they sell off some of their investments that are trading below their cost so they can use the losses to offset capital gains earned during the year, thereby reducing their taxes. In some cases, the investor may want to buy back the investments that were sold at a loss. If the investor buys back the investments that they sold for a loss immediately, the loss from the disposition will be deemed a superficial loss, and the investor will not be able to use the loss to offset capital gains for that year. A \u201csuperficial loss\u201d occurs when an investor sells capital property at a loss, and: The investor (or a person affiliated to the investor) buys or has the right to buy, the same or identical property (called substituted property) within a 61-day time frame \u2013 from 30 days before the sale to 30 days after the sale; and The investor still owns or has a right to buy, the substituted property 30 days after the sale. If the investor is the individual acquiring the substituted property, the investor can usually add the superficial loss amount to the ACB of the substituted property, thus, either reducing capital gains or increasing the capital loss when the substituted property is sold. 2.1.7 Tax deferral \u00b6 Because of the time-value of money, it is quite often efficient to defer taxation as much as possible. A good example of this is the use of RRSP. Unlike accrued interest (which is taxed annually), increases or declines in the value of an investment, known a \u201cpaper\u201d or \u201cunrealized\u201d gains and losses are not reported for tax purposes until the year in which the asset is actually sold or \u201cdeemed\u201d sold; at the time of sale there is a \u201crealized\u201d or \u201cactual\u201d gain or loss. Example An investor buys a stock for $10 in year 1, and it rises in value to $15 in year 2, and then it rises to $20 in year 3 at which point the investor sells it. In this case, there is no tax consequence in year 2 (at which point there is an \u201cunrealized\u201d gain of $5), but there is a realized capital gain of $10 in year 3 which must be reported. 2.1.8 Tax-free capital gains \u00b6 There are exceptions to the taxation of capital gains. Some capital gains are tax-free. A notable example is the tax exemption given to capital gains on the individual\u2019s or family unit\u2019s principal residence. 2.1.8.1 Tax-free gains on principal residence \u00b6 Capital gains on a principal residence are tax-free in Canada. Only one principal residence can be owned at a time per family unit, which includes spouse and children under 18 years of age. The principal residence can include a house, condominium, cottage, houseboat, mobile home, trailer, and an apartment unit in an apartment building or duplex. 2.1.9 Valuation Day rules, 1982 changes and 1994 capital gains elections and implications \u00b6 Prior to December 31, 1971, capital gains were not taxed in Canada. This changed after 1971. An ACB for publicly traded shares was established using the fair market value as on December 22, 1971, and for other assets the ACB was the fair market value as on December 31, 1971. However, a principal residence would remain exempt from taxation. At that time, the principal residence exemption was given on a per individual basis. This meant that couples could own two principal residences and utilize the exemption, provided they were not jointly owned. This ended in 1982 when the rules changed to one principal residence at a time per family unit. As a result of the change, a couple could now only own one principal residence. Couples were advised to determine the fair market value of the homes as on December 31, 1981, to have a base against which to measure future gains. The rules changed again in 1994 when the federal government eliminated the lifetime capital gains exemption (LCGE) of $100,000. Many individuals with second residences applied any unused exemption to their second residences to raise the ACB. From an insurance perspective, many families who own a second residence and want to pass it on to their children and/or grandchildren use life insurance to pay the tax on taxable capital gains at death. 2.1.10 Small business exemption and farm exemption \u00b6 There is an LCGE applicable to qualified small business corporation shares, working farms and qualified fishing property. The purpose of the exemption is to make it easier for people to pass their businesses, farm or fishing properties on to the next generation. Qualified farm or fishing properties (QFFP) disposed of after April 20, 2015, are eligible for an additional deduction., effectively increasing the lifetime capital gains exemption (LCGE) to $1 million for QFFP. Indexed to inflation since 2014, the LCGE for small businesses (non farm or fishing) is $883,384 (in 2020), which means a capital gains deduction of up to $ 441,692. 2.1.11 Taxation of rental income \u00b6 Rental income is taxable. Some of the costs associated with maintaining a rental property are tax deductible, such as: Legal, accounting and other professional fees; Maintenance, upkeep and repairs; Office expenses; Insurance; and Property taxes. If the rented space is within the taxpayer\u2019s home certain expenses such as property tax would be limited to a reasonable percentage based on the number of rooms or square footage area rented out. Net rental income is considered earned income for the purpose of RRSP contributions. 2.1.12 Exceptions (an adventure or concern in the nature of trade) \u00b6 The CRA\u2019s position is that if an individual does something that produces a profit on a regular basis, it is not considered a capital gain but income. The phrase the CRA uses is \u201ccarrying on a trade or business notwithstanding that these activities may be quite separate and apart from his ordinary occupation\u201d. An example is that if a dentist who habitually buys and sells real estate. In some circumstances, this rule can also apply to buying and selling securities. Example Karen quit her job to become a day trader. Last year she had more than 500 trades. She had profits for some and losses for others. Overall she had a net profit of $125,000 after transaction costs. Because this is her full-time occupation, the CRA is likely to take the view that Karen is in \u201can adventure or concern in the nature of trade\u201d and the $125,000 is business income (against which she can deduct office and similar expenses) and not capital gains. 2.2 Corporate Structure and Taxation \u00b6 Many small businesses are structured as a corporation. When a business owner incorporates the business, it is a separate entity, legally and for tax purposes. Advantages of incorporation include: Limited liability; Opportunities for income splitting through a share structure; Ability to retain income in the corporation and invested by the corporation; Lower tax rates for corporations than individuals. Disadvantages of incorporation include: Greater regulation; Record keeping; Higher legal costs; Accounting costs. 2.2.1 Flat tax rate \u00b6 Unlike individuals who have a graduated tax rate structure, corporations have a flat tax rate. For a Canadian-controlled private corporation, the federal tax rate is 9% (2020). Provincial tax rates range from nil to 4.5%. Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s small business tax rate is 5%. 2.2.2 Using a corporation to meet income splitting demands \u00b6 Corporations can pay dividends from after-tax profits to their shareholders. The share structure of a corporation can be tailored to provide income splitting amongst shareholders. For example, a spouse within a lower marginal tax rate could subscribe to shares in a company run by the other spouse. Because the spouse is in a lower marginal tax rate, they would pay minimal tax on dividends received on the shares. 2.2.3 Holding companies \u00b6 An agent may have clients who have investment in holding companies, with the holding company being used alongside an operating company and holding the shares of the operating company. Like with other corporations, this arrangement has cost implications in the form of filing financial statements and corporate tax returns. These costs can be significant relative to the income earned. These holding companies that were popular at one time due to tax deferrals are now falling out of favour due to changes in tax rates over the years. 2.3 Taxation of Trusts \u00b6 Mutual funds and segregated funds are structured as trusts and avoid taxation by \u201cflowing through\u201d all interest, capital gains, and dividends to unitholders (the investors that own the funds). The rule is that either the trust pays the tax on the income, or the income is flowed through to individual investors, who pay the tax. These funds flow through net interest income, eligible dividends, and foreign dividends to the investors. Mutual funds flow through net capital gains and, in the case of segregated funds, through capital gains and capital losses. The funds issue the relevant tax slips to investors. 2.4 Arm\u2019s Length and Non-Arm\u2019s Length Transactions \u00b6 \u201cArm\u2019s length\u201d transactions occur between parties that are non-related while a non-arm\u2019s length transaction takes place between related parties. The Income Tax Act (ITA) states that related persons shall be deemed not to act at arm\u2019s length with each other regardless of how they conduct business. Related persons include blood relationships or relationships through marriage. The ITA also states that a corporation owned by a person will be related to another person including a corporation, in which the person has a controlling interest. Hence, a corporation will be related to a person if that: Person controls the corporation; Person is a member of a related group that controls the corporation; Person is related to a person as described. This leads to various corporate dealings that would not be considered arms-length transactions. These definitions are important because special tax rules apply to transactions between related persons such as between spouses or between a corporation and its president. For example, an interest-free loan given by a corporation to its president will be considered a taxable benefit to the president. If the company charges the president the prescribed interest rate for the loan, no taxable benefit would arise. The prescribed interest rate for shareholders is published quarterly by CRA. Currently, it is around 1%. 2.5 Spousal and Common-Law Relations \u00b6 Married couples and common-law couples have property rights that vary from province to province. A province may consider that married spouses have equal interests in the family residence even if the residence is owned and was paid for by one of the spouses. The same may not apply to common-law spouses. In contrast, in common-law situations, that same province may hold that only the registered owner of the family home has the property rights. 2.5.1 Rights on relationship breakdown \u00b6 Property accumulated during the marriage or relationship will be divided equally among the divorcing and separating spouses, subject to any prenuptial or post-nuptial agreement. Property acquired prior to the relationship generally remains with that person, as do any inheritances and insurance benefits received. Tax experts usually advise the couple on the most tax-efficient way to achieve the division of assets. 2.5.2 Tax implications on relationship breakdown \u00b6 The tax implications can be complicated, especially if it involves spousal support and child support payments. An agent should refer a client to tax and legal specialists to speak on these matters. Generally, spousal payments are tax deductible to the payor and taxable as income to the recipient spouse. Payments for child support are not tax deductible nor are they taxable. If equalization payments are required, a special transfer of RRSP, RRIF or pension assets can be made using form T2220. Note that agents should refer a client to tax and legal specialists to speak on these matters. 2.5.3 Tax implications on death \u00b6 Assets owned by a deceased spouse generally can be transferred to the surviving spouse without tax implications. The surviving spouse will assume the deceased spouse\u2019s ACB for the transferred assets. The surviving spouse would be able to transfer the deceased spouse\u2019s RRSP or RRIF as a tax-free refund of premiums to their RRSP or RRIF, or buy a registered annuity. Proceeds of a life insurance policy with the surviving spouse as a beneficiary will be received tax-free, as would any beneficiary. 2.6 Income Attribution Rules \u00b6 Income splitting is a method of reducing overall taxes paid by a family unit by transferring income from a higher marginal tax rate family member to a family member that has a lower marginal tax rate. CRA has implemented \u201cincome attribution rules\u201d to prevent income splitting between spouses and other family members. Where attribution rules apply for property given to a family member, the first generation income earned on that property is attributed back and taxed in the hands of the giving family member. Any second generation income (income earned on reinvested income) is taxed in the hands of the recipient income earner. 2.6.1 Between spouses \u00b6 The attribution rules pertain to zero interest loans, transfers of property and gifts which could be used as an investment. Example Ethel (whose federal marginal tax rate is 29%) lends $100,000 to her spouse Fred (whose federal marginal tax rate is 15%) to invest in the stock market. The loan is not documented, and no interest is charged. Under attribution rules, any income earned must be taxed as Ethel\u2019s since she has the higher federal marginal tax rate. The attribution rules would not apply, however, if Ethel were to lend funds to Fred to start up a business. In that case, any gains or losses would be Fred\u2019s. However, attribution rules will not apply if the spouse making the loan charges the other spouse interest at rates at least equal to the prescribed rates, and provided the interest is collected by January 30 each year and reported as income on the lender\u2019s tax return. Example George lends his wife Loretta $100,000 for investment purposes. He charges her 1% interest, the CRA prescribed rate at the time. He collects that interest and reports it on his tax return. Loretta must declare any interest, dividends or capital gains received from the investments on her tax return. 2.6.2 Between parents and minor children or grandchildren \u00b6 Parents or grandparents can give monetary gifts to children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews. If these funds are invested, attribution rules apply, but in a manner different than that applicable to spouses. Any interest or dividends earned by the children are attributed back to the parents or grandparents. Capital gains or losses are not attributed back and are taxed in the hands of the child or grandchild. Example Irving buys $10,000 worth of bank shares and gifts them to his minor granddaughter Ellen. The shares pay about $400 in dividends each year. Irving is responsible for reporting the dividend as his income. Any capital gains triggered when the shares are sold are Ellen\u2019s and, therefore, are reported on her tax return. 2.6.3 Between parents and adult children and grandchildren \u00b6 Any monetary gifts given to adult children or grandchildren by parents or grandparents are theirs and no attribution rules apply to gifts. However if zero interest loans are involved, attribution rules do apply to income splitting between adult children or grandchildren and parents (or grandparents). Again, charging an interest rate of at least the prescribed rates prevents the application of attribution rules. 2.6.4 Tax treatment of income stemming from below-market loans to spouses \u00b6 The exemption to the attribution rules is dependent on the loan to the spouse having interest charged at the market rate or the prescribed rate. The prescribed rate is tied to Treasury bill rates. The prescribed rate is currently 1% (third quarter 2020), but has been higher in the past and is subject to revision by CRA on a quarterly basis.","title":"Chapter 2 Investment Income"},{"location":"taxation/Chapter_2_Investment_Income/#chapter-2-investment-income","text":"Employment income is the primary source of total income for most individuals.

If investment income is earned in a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP), a registered pension plan (RPP) or a deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP) all income is taxable including the capital invested as the capital invested reduces the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income. If the investment is in a registered education savings plan (RESP), only the growth in the plan is fully taxable when the funds are withdrawn. This is because when the investment was made it would have been with after-tax dollars.

The corporation is the beneficiary of a term insurance policy on her life. Martina dies and the proceeds of the policy are paid out to the corporation and applied to the capital dividend account. They are distributed tax-free to the shareholders.","title":"2.1.2.1 Other types of dividends"},{"location":"taxation/Chapter_2_Investment_Income/#213-dividend-income-from-foreign-source","text":"Dividend income received from foreign sources does not receive the dividend tax credit.

Tax treaties between Canada and most other countries help offset the tax liability on the dividend by way of a foreign tax credit, which credits the withholding tax already paid in the foreign country against the tax owing. As a result of these tax treaties, most countries waive withholding taxes on income paid from registered savings plans such as an RRSP or RRIF. However, there is no mechanism for refunding withholding taxes pertaining to investments in a TFSA.

A sale of a capital property may also result in a capital loss if the property is sold for a value less than its ACB. Currently, 50% of capital gains are taxable (i.e., capital gains have a 50% \u201cinclusion rate\u201d). Taxable capital gain = 50% \u00d7 (proceeds of disposition - ACB) For example, if an investor purchases shares in a corporation for $5,000 and later sells those shares for $8,000, then the investor has a $3,000 capital gain and a taxable capital gain of only $1,500. If the investor was in a 30% MTR, the taxes owing on the $3,000 capital gain would be $450 (30% of the taxable capital gain of $1,500). Capital property is any property held outside of a registered account which the taxpayer invests with the view of making income. Capital property includes cottages, rental properties, building and equipment used in a business, stocks and bonds, mutual funds, segregated funds, etc., held outside a tax deferral account. Please note that a capital gain is triggered by a sale of the capital property. While the capital property is being held by the owner, no capital gain is triggered although the capital property might be appreciating in value. Accrued capital gains are not taxed annually. Only realized capital gain on the disposition of a capital property is subject to tax. Hence, investment in capital property may provide a means of tax deferral to an investor. A capital property need not be sold, to trigger a capital gains tax. A deemed sale occurs if an individual exchanges one property for another; gifts a property; if the property is stolen or destroyed; a person emigrates from Canada; and upon the death of the property owner. Personal property The disposition of personal property does not trigger a capital gain or loss. Personal property is a property owned by a person and used for his or her sole pleasure without intention of making any income on the property such as a boat or an automobile; household furniture; clothing; etc. The CRA assumes that each of these properties has an ACB of $1,000 and holds that most personal property depreciates over time. Example Andreas holds a garage sale to sell CDs, videos, clothing, toys and a table and chair set. She does not need to report her income from the garage sale. Listed personal property - The exceptions to this rule are listed as personal property and include prints, etchings, drawings, paintings, sculptures, or other works of art; jewellery; rare folios, manuscripts or books; stamps; coins. - Net gains (and losses) on these must be reported on tax returns, although losses on listed personal property may only be deducted against gains from listed personal property.","title":"2.1.5 Capital gains \u2013 Disposition of capital assets"},{"location":"taxation/Chapter_2_Investment_Income/#216-rules-pertaining-to-capital-losses","text":"Similarly, a capital loss occurs when an investor sells a capital property for a price less than its ACB.

A taxpayer can carry back the net capital loss to reduce or eliminate capital gains in any of the three immediately prior tax years or carry the loss forward into a future year. When carrying forward net capital losses from previous years to be used in a current year, the taxpayer needs to be cautious of the fact that the capital gains inclusion rate may have changed and thus would need to make an adjustment. In the Notice of Assessment, CRA provides the adjusted net capital losses that are carried forward and which may be applied against capital gains in the current year.

Example Richard bought a $300,000 life insurance policy and named his wife, Suzanne, as the baneficiary. Richard has only had this policy for a few years. Even if he dies tomorrow and has only paid a fraction of the policy\u2019s premiums, Suzanne will still receive $300,000 tax free. If there is a delay in payment to a beneficiary and interest accrues, the interest (which is also payable to the beneficiary) is taxable, but the original death benefit is not taxable. Example When Richard died overseas, there was a delay in obtaining the documentation required by the insurer. After it had been obtained, the insurer paid the death benefit, plus $945 in interest. Suzanne was required to report the $945 as interest income. The beneficiary can choose to take the death benefit in a lump sum in the form of either: A lump sum (which ends the contract); or An annuity that results in a new contract. If there is a delay in the payment of the death benefit, any interest that accrues is taxable in the hands of the beneficiary or beneficiaries. Example As the beneficiary of her husband\u2019s life insurance policy, Martha chose to take the death benefit as a life annuity rather than as a lump sum. She will be taxed on the interest portion of the annuity payments. 3.2 Named Beneficiary \u00b6 The owner of a life insurance policy can choose to designate anyone as a beneficiary. Probate is the process of validating the will. Probate fees are charged by the courts for undergoing the validation process. Probate fees vary by province. Life insurance proceeds paid directly to a named beneficiary stay outside the estate and are not governed by the will, and are therefore not subject to probate fees (such as the Estate Administrator Tax). When the estate is named as the beneficiary, the proceeds will become a part of the deceased\u2019s estate and be distributed according to the will. As such, the proceeds will be subject to probate fees because it\u2019s a part of the deceased\u2019s estate assets. Example Michael had substantial debts when he died and few assets. The named beneficiary on his life insurance policy, was his wife, Renata. The insurer paid her the benefit. Michael\u2019s creditors, which included the Canada Revenue Agency, therefore had no claim on the amount paid. If Michael had named his estate as beneficiary, the insured amount would have been available to his creditors and subject to probate. 3.3 Premiums \u00b6 Depending on the type of insurance the premiums paid may or may not be tax-deductible. In the sections that follow, we will discuss the taxation of premiums for each of the following types of policies: Individual/Group Life Insurance; Individual/Group Health Insurance; and Individual/Group Disability Insurance. 3.3.1 Individual life insurance \u00b6 Individual life insurance proceeds are generally not tax deductible. An exception is in a business context, if the insurance is required as collateral for a loan, then the premiums may be deductible. The loan must be with a chartered bank, trust company or credit union and documented. Only the lower amount of the actual premium that is attributable to the loan (the \u201cnet cost of pure insurance\u201d (NCPI)) can be deducted. Example 1 Jenn bought a 10-year life insurance policy and pays her premiums monthly. She cannot deduct these premiums from income for tax purposes. Example 2 Saul personally guarantees his business line of credit at the bank where he does business. His bank requires that he have life insurance equal to the line of credit, with the benefit assigned to the bank. The term policy issued to Saul has $1,000,000 coverage. The loan amount Saul\u2019s business owed the bank last year was about $400,000. Given that the loan is for business purposes and from a financial institution, he can deduct 40% ( $400,000 \u00f7 $1,000,000) of the lesser amount of the premium and NCPI as a business expense. 3.3.2 Group life insurance \u00b6 Proceeds are received tax-free, provided: The employee pays the premiums with after-tax cash; or The employer pays the premiums that are then reported as a taxable benefit to the employee. Qu\u00e9bec is the exception where employer-paid premiums are taxable and must be reported on the provincial tax return of employees. Example Lana\u2019s employer pays the premiums on the company\u2019s group life insurance policy and reports the amount of the premium attributed to Lana as a taxable benefit on her T4 slip. Since Lana pays the premiums from after-tax income so the death benefit would be received tax-free. 3.3.3 Group health insurance \u00b6 Unlike group life premiums, group health premiums (such as a medical plan and dental plan) paid by the employer are: Tax deductible by the employer; and Not a taxable benefit to the employee. Qu\u00e9bec is the exception where the premiums are a taxable benefit and must be reported on the employee\u2019s provincial tax return and not the federal tax return. This is why the employment income reported on a T4 often differs from the one reported on the Relev\u00e9 1 for a Qu\u00e9bec resident. In all provinces, any portion of medical expenses that are prescribed (or eligible) under tax law and not covered by the policy can be claimed as medical expenses on that employee\u2019s tax return. 3.3.4 Individual health insurance \u00b6 Private health plan premiums can be claimed as eligible medical expenses. Example Karen\u2019s employer does not offer group health insurance coverage. Consequently, she arranged her own coverage online. She can claim the premiums she pays as eligible medical expenses. 3.3.5 Individual disability insurance \u00b6 The premiums paid on private disability policies are not tax deductible. The benefits received are also not taxable. Example Jonathan is self-employed. He takes out an individual disability insurance policy. He cannot deduct the premiums from income for tax purposes, but any benefits he receives will be tax-free. 3.3.6 Group disability insurance \u00b6 Group Insurance contracts can include: Long-term disability (LTD) benefits; Short-term disability (STD) benefits; or Both LTD and STD benefits. Premiums may be paid by either the employee or employer: If the employee pays the premiums, it is done with the employee's after-tax income. The benefits are received tax-free and not reported on the tax return (this is the most preferred and most common structure for LTD plans); If the employer pays the premiums, the premium is tax deductible by the employer and not a taxable benefit to the employee. The benefits received are taxable in the hands of the employee (this is the most preferred and most common structure for STD plans). 3.4 Life Insurance Policy Dispositions \u00b6 Although life insurance proceeds are received tax-free, there are other transactions related to life insurance policies that can have tax consequences. There are several transactions that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) generally considers to be a disposition for tax purposes. Therefore, any gains in the following situations would be taxable: Policy loans; Partial withdrawals; Surrenders; and Transfers to another party. Note that the Income Tax Act provides for an exception such that transfers between spouses have no tax consequences. A taxable policy gain is calculated as follows: Taxable policy gain = proceeds of disposition or cash surrender value (CSV) - adjusted cost base (ACB) Example Sandra decides to surrender her policy. The policy has a cash surrender value of $13,500 and an adjusted cost basis of $8,000. Sandra will therefore report taxable income of $5,500 = ( $13,500 \u2013 $8,000). 3.4.1 Adjusted cost base \u00b6 For tax purposes, the adjusted cost base (ACB) is the \u201ccost\u201d of a life insurance policy. Insurance companies will typically provide the ACB to the policyholder if required or requested. Very important for agents to know what affects the ACB and how to calculate the ACB. How the ACB is calculated depends on when the policy was last acquired. The rules regarding the ACB calculation changed in 1982, and the old rules still apply to policies that have been \u201clast acquired\u201d before the change. The NCPI calculation of the was modified in 2017 and that new calculation tends to decrease the NCPI. For policies last acquired after December 1, 1982, the ACB is calculated as follows: Adjusted cost base (ACB) = premium paid For grandfathered policies issued prior to December 2, 1982, the entire premium is considered to be the ACB. Adjusted cost base (ACB) = premiums paid - NCPI 3.5 Exempt or Non-Exempt Life Insurance Policies \u00b6 Permanent policies may be either exempt or non-exempt. Term policies have no CSV and, therefore, the distinction between exempt and non-exempt does not apply to term policies. The rules pertaining to exempt and non-exempt policies will change after 2015. 3.5.1 Exempt \u00b6 If a life insurance policy is exempt, the earnings on the cash value in the policy are not subject to taxation in the hands of the policyholder. Permanent life insurance policies acquired prior to December 2, 1982, are always exempt. If the policy is sold then the exemption no longer applies. Policies acquired after December 1, 1982, are exempt if they are purchased for the sole purpose of providing insurance and not as a means of investment. 3.5.2 Non-exempt \u00b6 A non-exempt policy is one that is last acquired after December 1, 1982, but fails to meet the Income Tax Act exemption requirements. For additional information on the Income Tax Act, consult the Justice Laws Website at: http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/ . Upon failing to meet the exemption requirements, earnings are taxable (annually) as regular income in the hands of the policyholder. On the policy\u2019s anniversary, the insurance company must conduct an exemption test. Recall from the previous section that, a policy is considered exempt, if the sole purpose of the death benefit is strictly for insurance purposes and not as a means of investment. Tax rules are changing (some changes came to effect in 2015) regarding exempt and non-exempt policies. This flux has a great impact on life insurance policies. Term policies do not have a cash surrender value (CSV) and as such the distinction between exempt and non-exempt does not apply to term policies. 3.5.3 Universal life policies \u00b6 When the cash accumulation limits permitted by tax laws are exceeded due to investment growth, the insurer transfers the excess funds to a side account in order for the policy to remain exempt. Only the income earned in the side account will be taxable. 3.6 Policy Loans \u00b6 If an insurance policy has a CSV, the policyholder can borrow up to the full amount of the CSV from the policy. This is known as a policy loan and can only be done if the policy allows for policy loans: Amounts up to the ACB can be borrowed tax-free; Amounts borrowed in excess of the ACB are taxable; and When the loan is repaid, the policyholder can claim a tax deduction up to the amount that was previously reported as income. Example Mario needs money for a home renovation. His insurance agent tells him he can borrow up to $9,000 from his policy (the CSV), but he will have to declare $4,000 as income because his ACB is $5,000. Mario borrows the money, and when he repays it the following year, he deducts the $4,000 from his taxable income. 3.7 Corporate Ownership of Life and Disability Insurance \u00b6 Corporations often purchase insurance on key executives and employees. Benefits received from these policies are tax-free. Premiums are usually not deducted from income. If the employee dies, the corporation receives the death benefit. 3.7.1 Tax implications of a person buying back a corporate policy \u00b6 If a corporation has life insurance on an employee, and the corporation sells or gifts the policy to the employee upon retirement, any policy gain will be taxable to the corporation. This applies only to permanent policies. Term policies have no CSV and, therefore, there would never be an associated policy gain nor any taxable consequences. Expert advice should be sought when there is a taxable benefit to the employee. Example When Yvette was hired by her employer five years ago, the company purchased a 10-year term policy on her life. The company merged with another and Yvette\u2019s position was redundant. As part of her severance package, the company assigned her the term policy. There is no policy gain for the company on the transfer of this term policy to Yvette. 3.7.2 Tax strategy based on the differential between corporate and personal tax rates \u00b6 In cases where the corporation is the beneficiary of the policy, if the insured dies the corporation receives the benefit. Corporations benefit from a lower tax than shareholders. Therefore, it is advantageous, for the corporation, rather than the shareholder to buy the life insurance policy. Example Bert has a combined federal and provincial marginal tax rate of 49.5%. The corporation he and his wife own has a combined federal and provincial marginal tax rate of 15.5%. Bert is not an employee of the firm. The premiums paid on a life insurance policy on Bert would not be deductible, either by the corporation or by Bert. Consequently, there are savings by having the corporation with its lower tax rate pay the premium. When Bert dies, the proceeds of the policy will flow through the company\u2019s Capital Dividend Account (CDA) to the shareholders on a tax-free basis. For example, to pay a $10,000 annual premium, the company would only have to access $11,834 of corporate profits while Bert would have to be paid $19,802 out of company profits to have the necessary $10,000 after-tax to pay the premium. 3.7.3 Capital Dividend Account (CDA) \u00b6 The Capital Dividend Account (CDA) is where a corporation receives and holds any tax-free amounts, such as life insurance proceeds. Any amount in the CDA can be paid out as tax-free capital dividends to shareholders. 3.7.4 Tax treatments of the benefit when the insured is an employee, shareholder, or both \u00b6 Corporations frequently pay disability and life insurance policy premiums for the employee or shareholder. The shareholder or employer would be the policyholder, the beneficiary or both. Premiums paid by a corporation are: Tax deductible by the employer and a taxable benefit for the employee; and Not tax deductible by the employer and taxable to the shareholder. Example Louise is employed as a financial controller for a corporation. She also owns 15% of the company\u2019s shares. Because of her ownership position any premiums paid on her behalf are not deductible and are added to her income as a taxable benefit. Consequently, she pays the premiums on her life insurance policy directly. 3.8 Policy Dividends \u00b6 Permanent whole life policies may pay dividends to policyholders. Note that policy dividends are not the same as corporate dividends. Policy dividends are tax-free when used to offset premiums or paid out as a death benefit. When policy dividends are paid out prior to death, they are taxable as income as they are considered to be proceeds of disposition. They are not entitled to the dividend tax credit as is the case with capital dividends. If the amount of the dividend exceeds the ACB in any given year, the excess would be treated as a disposition of the policy gain and is taxable in the hands of the policyholder. 3.9 Annuities and Segregated Funds \u00b6 A wide range of annuities are offered by insurance companies such as the individual variable insurance contracts (IVICs). IVICs are also referred to as annuity contracts and hold segregated funds. The taxation of the following annuities are explained in the sections below: Non-registered annuities contracts; Non-registered individual variable insurance contracts (IVICs); and Registered annuties contracts. 3.9.1 Non-registered annuities contracts \u00b6 Non-registered annuity contracts is taxable. How they are taxed depends on the structure and the type of income being paid. Both segregated funds and annuities may be registered or non-registered. For non-registered annuities, a portion of the payments is received tax-free as a return of capital, and a portion is received as interest income and is thus taxable; For registered annuities, all payments are fully taxable as regular income. 3.9.1.1 Accumulation annuities or guaranteed interest annuities \u00b6 Accumulation annuities or guaranteed interest annuities are savings products similar to guaranteed investment certificates (GIC) and term deposits offered by banks. They offer creditor protection and avoid probate when a beneficiary is named. Interest earned is taxable in the year received or accrued (even if not received). 3.9.1.2 Prescribed annuities \u00b6 Prescribed annuities offer a special tax advantage \u2013 the interest (taxable) and return of capital (non-taxable) portions are spread equally across all of the payments. With a non-prescribed annuity, the payments the holder receives would be more interest than principal in the early years of the term to maturity and less interest than principal near the end of the term. For two identical annuities, one qualifying as prescribed and the other one not, the total amounts of interest reported over the life of the annuity would be identical. What differs is that the holder of the prescribed annuity would report less taxable income in the early years and consequently pay less tax. Example Lola has an inheritance of $100,000 and wants annual annuity payments for 20 years. Annuity interest rates for that term are currently 3.15%. Her agent tells her that the annual payment on a 20-year prescribed annuity with a $100,000 deposit will be about $6,800, of which $1,800 is taxable. The interest that would accrue for the first year on a non-prescribed annuity would be $3,150 (3.15% \u00d7 $100,000). It would drop to approximately $1,800 by the eleventh year. Lola chooses the prescribed annuity and understands that the taxable portion each year will be a level $1,800 as shown in the following graph. Had she chosen the alternative non-prescribed annuity the taxable portion in the first year would be $3,150 declining each year after that. Lola decides that it is to her advantage to pay less tax now. Annual taxable interest from a prescribed annuity contract and a non-prescribed annuity contract 3.9.1.3 Structured settlement annuities \u00b6 A structured settlement annuity is an annuity purchased by a casualty insurer as a settlement of a personal injury lawsuit. The lump sum is paid to the insurance company who then issues a single premium annuity and makes the tax-free payments to the injured party. Example Rudolph became a paraplegic after a vehicle ran a red light and hit him. The driver\u2019s insurer and Rudolph\u2019s lawyer have agreed on a settlement. The casualty insurer will purchase the annuity that will be paid to Rudolph tax-free. 3.9.2 Non-registered individual variable insurance contracts (IVIC) holding segregated funds \u00b6 Switching between segregated funds triggers a disposition which can create capital gains or losses. Unlike mutual funds, segregated funds do not distribute investment earnings to policyholders. The income is retained in the fund and the policyholder\u2019s ACB is adjusted to reflect the retained earnings. The policyholder is still taxed on the earnings as though they had been paid out and received. Interest, dividends, or capital gains must be reported on the T3 slip by the insurer. 3.9.2.1 Dividend, interest, and capital gains distributions \u00b6 Unlike mutual funds, investors of segregated funds receive prorated investment returns. Returns are prorated based on the time an investor holds the units in the fund during the year. Example Massimo bought 1,000 units of XYZ Segregated Equity Fund on June 1. The fund declared a dividend distribution of $1 a unit at year end. Massimo\u2019s T3 will show an allocation of $583.33 reflecting that he owned the units for seven of the 12 months: $583.33 = ((7 \u00f7 12) \u00d7 $1 \u00d7 1,000 units). On the other hand, the income earned through mutual funds is not prorated based on time held. Example Had Massimo bought a comparable mutual fund, his T3 from the fund would show a $1,000 distribution whether he bought it on January 1, June 1 or the day before the distribution was declared. 3.9.2.2 Treatment of capital losses \u00b6 Any capital losses in a segregated fund flow through to the contract holder and are reported on the contract holder\u2019s T3. This is unlike mutual funds where capital losses are used to offset capital gains within the fund. Capital losses not used in the present year can be carried forward or applied to losses in the past three years. 3.9.2.3 Tax treatment of death benefit or maturity guarantee \u00b6 Segregated funds typically provide a guaranteed amount at maturity (generally 10 years) or at death. The contract holder is guaranteed a minimum of 75% or 100% of the amount invested in the contract. The tax treatment applicable to these guarantees are ambiguous and uncertain. The segregated fund information folder contains the position of the insurer regarding tax treatment. 3.9.3 Taxation of registered contracts \u00b6 There is no tax on income earned (e.g., in terms of interest, capital gains and dividends) in registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs), registered retirement income funds (RRIFs) or other registered contracts. When money is withdrawn from these products, all funds are treated as taxable income. Regarding Registered Education Savings Plans (RESP), there are no tax consequences regarding the withdrawals of RESP contributions that were made with after-tax income. All Income earned when withdrawn is taxable.","title":"Chapter 3 Taxation and Insurance"},{"location":"taxation/Chapter_3_Taxation_and_Insurance/#chapter-3-taxation-and-insurance","text":"This chapter looks into the taxation conditions of life and disability insurance products (including annuities and segregated funds) within Canada in terms of: Death benefits; Named beneficiary; Premium; Adjusted costs base; Life insurance policy dispositions; Exempt and non-exempt policies; Policy loans; Corporate ownership of life and disability insurance; Policy dividends; and Specifics of annuities and segregated funds.","title":"Chapter 3: Taxation and Insurance"},{"location":"taxation/Chapter_3_Taxation_and_Insurance/#31-death-benefits","text":"Life insurance benefits are tax-free.

Even if he dies tomorrow and has only paid a fraction of the policy\u2019s premiums, Suzanne will still receive $300,000 tax free. If there is a delay in payment to a beneficiary and interest accrues, the interest (which is also payable to the beneficiary) is taxable, but the original death benefit is not taxable. Example When Richard died overseas, there was a delay in obtaining the documentation required by the insurer. After it had been obtained, the insurer paid the death benefit, plus $945 in interest. Suzanne was required to report the $945 as interest income. The beneficiary can choose to take the death benefit in a lump sum in the form of either: A lump sum (which ends the contract); or An annuity that results in a new contract. If there is a delay in the payment of the death benefit, any interest that accrues is taxable in the hands of the beneficiary or beneficiaries. Example As the beneficiary of her husband\u2019s life insurance policy, Martha chose to take the death benefit as a life annuity rather than as a lump sum. She will be taxed on the interest portion of the annuity payments.","title":"3.1 Death Benefits"},{"location":"taxation/Chapter_3_Taxation_and_Insurance/#32-named-beneficiary","text":"The owner of a life insurance policy can choose to designate anyone as a beneficiary. Probate is the process of validating the will. Probate fees are charged by the courts for undergoing the validation process. Probate fees vary by province. Life insurance proceeds paid directly to a named beneficiary stay outside the estate and are not governed by the will, and are therefore not subject to probate fees (such as the Estate Administrator Tax). When the estate is named as the beneficiary, the proceeds will become a part of the deceased\u2019s estate and be distributed according to the will. As such, the proceeds will be subject to probate fees because it\u2019s a part of the deceased\u2019s estate assets. Example Michael had substantial debts when he died and few assets. The named beneficiary on his life insurance policy, was his wife, Renata. The insurer paid her the benefit. Michael\u2019s creditors, which included the Canada Revenue Agency, therefore had no claim on the amount paid.

Example 2 Saul personally guarantees his business line of credit at the bank where he does business. His bank requires that he have life insurance equal to the line of credit, with the benefit assigned to the bank. The term policy issued to Saul has $1,000,000 coverage.

For two identical annuities, one qualifying as prescribed and the other one not, the total amounts of interest reported over the life of the annuity would be identical. What differs is that the holder of the prescribed annuity would report less taxable income in the early years and consequently pay less tax.

These strategies are examined within four principal components: Life insurance strategies used to offset or likely reduce taxes payable at death; Taxable investment strategies implementing life insurance products for tax benefits; Leveraging strategies and borrowing in terms of deductible income; and Donation program tax shelters. 4.1 Estate Planning \u00b6 For tax purposes, a person is considered to have sold all assets at fair value on the date of death for proceeds equal to the fair market value. This is known as a \u201cdeemed disposition\u201d of assets. For someone who is married (or common law) there are some exceptions to the deemed disposition and subsequent taxation of assets at death. Certain assets such as an RRSP can be rolled over to a surviving spouse without triggering a taxable event. Under the Income Tax Act, the taxation of the asset would be deferred until the funds are withdrawn or upon the death of the surviving spouse. This tax deferral provision is known as a \u201cspousal rollover\u201d. 4.1.1 Capital gains \u00b6 Life insurance can be a great tool for providing funds necessary to cover tax liabilities that arise upon death. Particularly when the objective is to maintain ownership of the asset within the family for the benefit of survivors. Example 1 Ralph and Melinda own a cottage that will be left to their daughter Martha, as stated in their wills. They purchased the cottage several decades ago and estimate that the tax on the taxable capital gain on the property will be around $100,000. They purchased a second-to-die $100,000 permanent life insurance policy to provide this amount so the estate will have the funds to pay the tax. Example 2 Three brothers own equal shares in a successful landscaping company. They have an agreement in place whereby, if one of the brothers should die, the surviving brothers will purchase the shares from the estate of the deceased. Their insurance agent arranges for each to buy insurance on the others\u2019 lives in amounts adequate to buy the shares. 4.1.2 Income tax payable on the death of a registered plan owner \u00b6 An individual\u2019s largest financial assets are often a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) and an RRSP. The fair market value of the RRIF at the time of death is taxable as income in that year. Life insurance is often used to pay taxes owing from the RRIF, thus leaving the beneficiaries with the full value of the RRIF. Example Ethel, who is a widow, turned 71 last year and rolled her $500,000 RRSP into an RRIF at year end. Ethel wants to leave an estate for her children. Her major asset is her RRIF. She recognizes that when she dies the market value of her RRIF will be income for tax purposes and a major portion of its value will be payable as income tax. She also realizes that if she lives a long time, there will be very little value left in her RRIF to provide an estate. If the value of her RRIF was $500,000 at the time of death, all of it would be considered as income and, depending on her other income at the time of death, most if not all would be taxable income. Depending on the province in which she resides at the time of death, the tax owing could be as much as $249,000. Ethel\u2019s insurance agent determines that she can obtain $250,000 of term 100 insurance at an annual premium of $9,540; this will provide the funds required to pay the substantial taxes that will be owed after her death if she dies in the next few years. If there is little residual value in her RRIF when she dies, then the insurance proceeds will provide funds for her children.Ethel, therefore, decides to apply for $250,000 to cover the potential tax bill, and funeral and other final expenses. Ethel decides that a life insurance policy will meet her specific need to ensure an estate for her beneficiaries. 4.1.3 Estate taxes and probate fees \u00b6 There are no estate taxes in Canada when a taxpayer dies. However, the deceased may face U.S. estate taxes if any property was owned in the U.S. In such cases, it is advisable to work with taxation experts knowledgeable about U.S. tax law to determine U.S. taxes owing (if any). Probate fees apply to mutual funds and savings instruments (outside of Qu\u00e9bec). Probate fees do not apply to: Life insurance death benefits when beneficiaries are named; Insurance company investment products (i.e., annuities and segregated funds). 4.2 Leveraging to Make an Investment \u00b6 Leverage is the term used to describe borrowing money for the purpose of investment. The concept is to increase investor\u2019s equity and thus profit above what it would be without the use of the borrowed funds. Both investors and agents should know that the investors are responsible for repaying the interest on the loan as well as repaying the principal if the value of the investment diminishes. Interest on the loan is tax deductible. However, if the borrowed funds are used to contribute to an RRSP then the interest is not tax deductible. Agents should be familiar with: Leverage guidelines provided by the insurers whose products they sell; and The mutual fund dealer\u2019s guidelines pertaining to leverage, if licensed to sell mutual funds. Many insurers and mutual fund dealer\u2019s place restrictions on using leverage programs for people who are near or in retirement. 4.2.1 Borrowing to contribute to a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) \u00b6 One strategy for clients who do not have the cash to make an RRSP contribution is to borrow a portion, or all the funds necessary to make that contribution. This strategy is usually implemented during the first 60 days of the calendar year prior to the RRSP contribution deadline. The loan would be repaid by using the tax refund stemming from the contribution or from take-home earned income over the year. With this strategy, the interest paid on the borrowed funds is not tax deductible. 4.2.2 Borrowing to buy a non-registered investment \u00b6 When a loan is taken out for investment purposes the interest paid on that loan is generally tax-deductible when the investment is made in a non-registered account, provided the investments have the potential to generate income. Opening \u2018margin accounts\u2019 with investment dealers is a strategy often used by investors to borrow against equity in their accounts with set limits in place. The ratio of debt to equity must stay within defined limits. A decrease in the value of the equity (the investments) will require the borrower to put up additional capital or sell enough assets to generate cash in the account to maintain the required ratio. Interest on margin loans is also tax deductible provided the loan is used to buy additional investments. Some agents recommend that their clients borrow money to buy segregated funds in rising markets. Leveraging can make sense when the anticipated return on investment is greater than the cost of borrowing. For example, a loan at 3% and investment returns of 8%. Example Madeline paid $500 interest on her investment loan. Her marginal tax rate is 46%. Consequently, she deducts this amount as a business expense, reducing the tax payable by 46% \u00d7 $500 = $230. The after-tax cost is $270 ( $500 \u2013 $230). Agents should resolve whether or not a leveraged investment strategy is appropriate for a particular client\u2019s needs. The appropriateness of such a strategy should be determined on an individual case-by-case basis in terms of: The apparent risks involved; and The cyclical and sometimes volatile nature of the market. Factors that should be considered when determining suitability are: Does the client have the cash flow available to service the debt for an extended period of time if the investment declines? Is the client\u2019s tax bracket beneficial in terms of interest deductibility? What is the client\u2019s tolerance for risk? Agents need to keep in mind that in the past interest rates have been higher than in the present. And while interest rates may be currently low, they can become higher in future years. Higher interest rates can altogether lessen or defeat the benefits of implementing a leverage strategy for the client. Ideally, investors should have accessible income to pay the interest or cover a potential margin call. Also, when borrowing to invest in segregated funds, Agents should know that redeeming segregated fund units to pay interest lowers the maturity guarantee. 4.3 Using Insurance Products for Long-Term Income \u00b6 Prescribed annuities can provide for long-term income and are beneficial from a tax perspective because the original capital and interest are spread over fixed payments. An insured annuity is a combination of 2 products: life insurance and a life annuity. For risk-averse investors, this is often an alternative solution to Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs). The prescribed annuity provides tax-advantaged income, and the life insurance provides a death benefit upon death. Example Fred, who is 70, recently sold his home and business and has $500,000 available for investment. He is unwilling to risk his capital and wants to leave that amount to his children. He is aware that he can earn 2.5% by purchasing a five-year GIC,which will provide him with a $12,500 annual income, all of which will be taxable. Fred\u2019s insurance agent suggests an alternative. He recommends that Fred apply for $500,000 of term-to-100 life insurance which will cost him $20,652 a year. Once that is approved Fred can buy a prescribed life annuity for $500,000 which will provide him with annual income of $38,440 with the taxable portion at $1,562. The annuity payment less the cost of the insurance will leave him an income of $17,788 ( $38,440 \u2013 $20,652) which far exceeds the $12,500 income from the GIC. Moreover, only $1,526 of the annuity income is taxable compared with all of the $12,500 GIC income. Fred\u2019s major risk is that interest rates will rise in the coming years and he will not benefit from any rate increase. 4.4 Charitable Donations \u00b6 Registered charities often seek out insurance policy donations from their supporters. Donors to registered charities receive a federal and provincial charitable donations tax credit. The donor would be the life insured, and the organization would be the policyholder and beneficiary of the policy. As long as the premiums continued to be paid, the organization will receive the death benefit upon the death of the life insured. For the donor, the federal charitable tax credit is 15% on the first $200 and 33% on any amounts more than $200: The 33% credit applies if the individual\u2019s income falls within the highest range of the marginal tax rate. The provincial tax credit rates differ in each province; These tax credits are non-refundable; Qu\u00e9bec residents may experience reduced tax savings when individuals are entitled to a refundable federal tax abatement. For donations made after March 20, 2013, qualifying first-time donors may receive an additional federal tax credit of 25% on the first $1,000 of monetary donations. An individual may claim a tax credit for a donation up to 75% of net income: The donation limit is 100% of the net income in the year of death; Any unused amount can be carried back to the year prior to the year of death (the donation limit would be up to 100% of income in that year). 4.4.1 Assigning a new insurance policy to a charity \u00b6 A common strategy is to purchase a life insurance policy to provide a charitable donation to a registered charity upon death. To be entitled to the charitable tax credit (for the premiums paid on the life insurance policy), the policy must be assigned so that the charity is the holder and the beneficiary of the life insurance policy. Example Rifka has been donating $500 annually to the alumni fund of the university she attended and receives a tax credit receipt for that amount each year. A representative of the university suggested that she consider buying a life insurance policy and assigning it to the university. She agreed and purchased a term-100 life policy with an annual premium of $500 and a face amount of $50,000. She assigns the policy to the university and continues to pay the premium for which the university issues a charitable donation tax credit receipt equal to the premium. Assuming Rifka does not let the policy lapse, the insurance company will pay $50,000 to the university when she dies. 4.4.2 Assigning an existing policy to a charity \u00b6 Another common strategy is to donate an existing policy to a registered charity. In such cases, the charity will issue a charitable donation tax credit receipt for the cash surrender value (CSV) of the policy. Additional tax receipts will be issued any additional premiums paid by the donor. Note that if the policy CSV exceeds the policy\u2019s adjusted cost base (ACB), the policy gain will be taxable as income in the year the policy was donated to the registered charity. Example Lars has a permanent life insurance policy he no longer needs. The market value of the policy is $12,000. He calls the fund-raising office at his local hospital and speaks with the director who informs him that if he assigns the policy to the hospital, he will receive a tax credit receipt for the market value. Furthermore, if he continues to pay the premiums, he will receive tax credit receipts for these. 4.4.3 Naming a charity as beneficiary \u00b6 Another (less effective) strategy is for the life insurance policyholder to name a charity as the beneficiary of a policy. This is not as tax-efficient as the charity does not own the policy and, therefore, cannot issue receipts for the CSV or premiums paid. However, the charity will issue a donation receipt for the death benefit received to the deceased's estate. Example For example, Rosalind reviewed her finances and decided that she no longer needed the benefit from an insurance policy she had purchased decades earlier. She called the issuer who sent her a change of beneficiary form. SHe named the local animal shelter that is a registered charity, as the beneficiary. If she continues to pay the premiums to keep the policy in effect and does not change the beneficiary, when she dies the animal shelter will issue a charitable donation tax receipt to Rosalind\u2019s estate for the amount of the benefit it receives. Because the charity did not own the policy it could not issue charitable donation tax credit receipts for any of the premiums she paid. 4.4.4 Donating a segregated fund contract \u00b6 Special rules apply when publicly traded securities and insurance contracts holding segregated funds are donated to a registered charity. In normal circumstances upon the disposition of a security, 50% of a capital gain is taxable. However, when securities or segregated funds are donated to a registered charity, the capital gain inclusion rate is reduced to zero so that none of the capital gain is taxable. Example Jack redeems $100,000 of segregated funds that have an ACB of $50,000. He donates the money to a registered charity and receives a charitable tax credit receipt for $100,000. He pays tax on half his capital gains or $25,000. Jill, on the other hand, donates her $100,000 of segregated funds contract to a registered charity. While her ACB is also $50,000 her capital gains inclusion rate for the donation is zero, so she pays no tax on the capital gain and receives a charitable tax credit receipt for $100,000. For more information on segregated funds consult the Manulife Financial page, Charitable Giving at: https://repsourcepublic.manulife.com/ 4.4.5 Donation program tax shelters \u00b6 Donation program tax shelters are tax shelters and donation plans that offer unusually high returns, tax refunds or tax reductions in excess of the amount actually invested. The following is an example of what a tax shelter arrangement involving a charitable donation receipt look like: A promoter sells a tax shelter-like arrangement to individual taxpayers involving 10,000 pieces of art. Each taxpayer acquires one piece of art for its fair market value of $100. The valuator is aware of this information but agrees to appraise each art piece at $1,000. Concurrently, the promoter solicits a registered charity that agrees to accept the art as a charitable donation and issue a charitable donation receipt of the appraised value ( $1,000 per art piece). This charity immediately auctions off the art to the highest bidder, and the price paid reflects the $100 value per piece. A tax return specialist without any direct knowledge of the false statement, prepares the income tax return of a client who purchased a piece of art and donated it under this arrangement. The CRA reviews of the client's return and determines that it contains a false statement (the over-valuation of the property donated). Since the 1990s, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has continuously issued warnings about donation program tax shelters. In almost all cases, the tax donation credit issued for the donation will be disallowed, sometimes even retroactively, by the CRA. Advisors should proceed with a high degree of caution as many of such programs are offside with the CRA and could lead to trouble for both the advisor and the client. Agents should review the CRA documents on donation tax shelter schemes. In particular, the CRA publication, Canada Revenue Agency. Tax shelters. [online]. Revised December 12, 2013. [Cited August 1, 2014], states that \u201cthe CRA audits every mass-marketed tax shelter arrangement and no arrangement has been found to comply with the Income Tax Act\u201d. Agents need to know their employer policies and consequences regarding participation in these unauthorized activities.","title":"Chapter 4 Tax Strategies Using Life Insurance"},{"location":"taxation/Chapter_4_Tax_Strategies_Using_Life_Insurance/#chapter-4-tax-strategies-using-life-insurance","text":"Tax Strategies Using Life Insurance This chapter examines tax strategies that are implemented using life insurance.

Also, when borrowing to invest in segregated funds, Agents should know that redeeming segregated fund units to pay interest lowers the maturity guarantee.","title":"4.2.2 Borrowing to buy a non-registered investment"},{"location":"taxation/Chapter_4_Tax_Strategies_Using_Life_Insurance/#43-using-insurance-products-for-long-term-income","text":"Prescribed annuities can provide for long-term income and are beneficial from a tax perspective because the original capital and interest are spread over fixed payments. An insured annuity is a combination of 2 products: life insurance and a life annuity. For risk-averse investors, this is often an alternative solution to Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs). The prescribed annuity provides tax-advantaged income, and the life insurance provides a death benefit upon death. Example Fred, who is 70, recently sold his home and business and has $500,000 available for investment. He is unwilling to risk his capital and wants to leave that amount to his children. He is aware that he can earn 2.5% by purchasing a five-year GIC,which will provide him with a $12,500 annual income, all of which will be taxable. Fred\u2019s insurance agent suggests an alternative. He recommends that Fred apply for $500,000 of term-to-100 life insurance which will cost him $20,652 a year. Once that is approved Fred can buy a prescribed life annuity for $500,000 which will provide him with annual income of $38,440 with the taxable portion at $1,562. The annuity payment less the cost of the insurance will leave him an income of $17,788 ( $38,440 \u2013 $20,652) which far exceeds the $12,500 income from the GIC. Moreover, only $1,526 of the annuity income is taxable compared with all of the $12,500 GIC income. Fred\u2019s major risk is that interest rates will rise in the coming years and he will not benefit from any rate increase.","title":"4.3 Using Insurance Products for Long-Term Income"},{"location":"taxation/Chapter_4_Tax_Strategies_Using_Life_Insurance/#44-charitable-donations","text":"Registered charities often seek out insurance policy donations from their supporters. Donors to registered charities receive a federal and provincial charitable donations tax credit. The donor would be the life insured, and the organization would be the policyholder and beneficiary of the policy. As long as the premiums continued to be paid, the organization will receive the death benefit upon the death of the life insured. For the donor, the federal charitable tax credit is 15% on the first $200 and 33% on any amounts more than $200: The 33% credit applies if the individual\u2019s income falls within the highest range of the marginal tax rate. The provincial tax credit rates differ in each province; These tax credits are non-refundable; Qu\u00e9bec residents may experience reduced tax savings when individuals are entitled to a refundable federal tax abatement. For donations made after March 20, 2013, qualifying first-time donors may receive an additional federal tax credit of 25% on the first $1,000 of monetary donations. An individual may claim a tax credit for a donation up to 75% of net income: The donation limit is 100% of the net income in the year of death; Any unused amount can be carried back to the year prior to the year of death (the donation limit would be up to 100% of income in that year).","title":"4.4 Charitable Donations"},{"location":"taxation/Chapter_4_Tax_Strategies_Using_Life_Insurance/#441-assigning-a-new-insurance-policy-to-a-charity","text":"A common strategy is to purchase a life insurance policy to provide a charitable donation to a registered charity upon death. To be entitled to the charitable tax credit (for the premiums paid on the life insurance policy), the policy must be assigned so that the charity is the holder and the beneficiary of the life insurance policy. Example Rifka has been donating $500 annually to the alumni fund of the university she attended and receives a tax credit receipt for that amount each year. A representative of the university suggested that she consider buying a life insurance policy and assigning it to the university. She agreed and purchased a term-100 life policy with an annual premium of $500 and a face amount of $50,000. She assigns the policy to the university and continues to pay the premium for which the university issues a charitable donation tax credit receipt equal to the premium. Assuming Rifka does not let the policy lapse, the insurance company will pay $50,000 to the university when she dies.","title":"4.4.1 Assigning a new insurance policy to a charity"},{"location":"taxation/Chapter_4_Tax_Strategies_Using_Life_Insurance/#442-assigning-an-existing-policy-to-a-charity","text":"Another common strategy is to donate an existing policy to a registered charity. In such cases, the charity will issue a charitable donation tax credit receipt for the cash surrender value (CSV) of the policy. Additional tax receipts will be issued any additional premiums paid by the donor. Note that if the policy CSV exceeds the policy\u2019s adjusted cost base (ACB), the policy gain will be taxable as income in the year the policy was donated to the registered charity. Example Lars has a permanent life insurance policy he no longer needs. The market value of the policy is $12,000. He calls the fund-raising office at his local hospital and speaks with the director who informs him that if he assigns the policy to the hospital, he will receive a tax credit receipt for the market value. Furthermore, if he continues to pay the premiums, he will receive tax credit receipts for these.","title":"4.4.2 Assigning an existing policy to a charity"},{"location":"taxation/Chapter_4_Tax_Strategies_Using_Life_Insurance/#443-naming-a-charity-as-beneficiary","text":"Another (less effective) strategy is for the life insurance policyholder to name a charity as the beneficiary of a policy. This is not as tax-efficient as the charity does not own the policy and, therefore, cannot issue receipts for the CSV or premiums paid. However, the charity will issue a donation receipt for the death benefit received to the deceased's estate. Example For example, Rosalind reviewed her finances and decided that she no longer needed the benefit from an insurance policy she had purchased decades earlier. She called the issuer who sent her a change of beneficiary form. SHe named the local animal shelter that is a registered charity, as the beneficiary. If she continues to pay the premiums to keep the policy in effect and does not change the beneficiary, when she dies the animal shelter will issue a charitable donation tax receipt to Rosalind\u2019s estate for the amount of the benefit it receives. Because the charity did not own the policy it could not issue charitable donation tax credit receipts for any of the premiums she paid.","title":"4.4.3 Naming a charity as beneficiary"},{"location":"taxation/Chapter_4_Tax_Strategies_Using_Life_Insurance/#444-donating-a-segregated-fund-contract","text":"Special rules apply when publicly traded securities and insurance contracts holding segregated funds are donated to a registered charity. In normal circumstances upon the disposition of a security, 50% of a capital gain is taxable. However, when securities or segregated funds are donated to a registered charity, the capital gain inclusion rate is reduced to zero so that none of the capital gain is taxable. Example Jack redeems $100,000 of segregated funds that have an ACB of $50,000. He donates the money to a registered charity and receives a charitable tax credit receipt for $100,000. He pays tax on half his capital gains or $25,000. Jill, on the other hand, donates her $100,000 of segregated funds contract to a registered charity. While her ACB is also $50,000 her capital gains inclusion rate for the donation is zero, so she pays no tax on the capital gain and receives a charitable tax credit receipt for $100,000.

The following is an example of what a tax shelter arrangement involving a charitable donation receipt look like: A promoter sells a tax shelter-like arrangement to individual taxpayers involving 10,000 pieces of art. Each taxpayer acquires one piece of art for its fair market value of $100. The valuator is aware of this information but agrees to appraise each art piece at $1,000. Concurrently, the promoter solicits a registered charity that agrees to accept the art as a charitable donation and issue a charitable donation receipt of the appraised value ( $1,000 per art piece). This charity immediately auctions off the art to the highest bidder, and the price paid reflects the $100 value per piece. A tax return specialist without any direct knowledge of the false statement, prepares the income tax return of a client who purchased a piece of art and donated it under this arrangement. The CRA reviews of the client's return and determines that it contains a false statement (the over-valuation of the property donated). Since the 1990s, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has continuously issued warnings about donation program tax shelters. In almost all cases, the tax donation credit issued for the donation will be disallowed, sometimes even retroactively, by the CRA. Advisors should proceed with a high degree of caution as many of such programs are offside with the CRA and could lead to trouble for both the advisor and the client. Agents should review the CRA documents on donation tax shelter schemes. In particular, the CRA publication, Canada Revenue Agency. Tax shelters. [online]. Revised December 12, 2013. [Cited August 1, 2014], states that \u201cthe CRA audits every mass-marketed tax shelter arrangement and no arrangement has been found to comply with the Income Tax Act\u201d. Agents need to know their employer policies and consequences regarding participation in these unauthorized activities.","title":"4.4.5 Donation program tax shelters"}]}
