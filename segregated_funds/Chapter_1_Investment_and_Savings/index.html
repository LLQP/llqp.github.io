<ul>
<li>It is important to understand the basics of investing before focusing on segregated funds and annuities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="111-concept-of-investing">1.1.1 Concept of investing<a class="headerlink" href="#111-concept-of-investing" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>What is the basis for the concept of investing?</li>
<li>Investing can only begin when a individual has savings; savings can be encouraged by:<ul>
<li>Making savings an item in the budget by using effecctive ways like pre-authorized contribution (PAC) or pre-authorized deposit (PAD) to a savings or investment account;</li>
<li>Save at 10% of take-home pay;</li>
<li>Save exceptional payments - e.g: income-tax refunds and work bonus;</li>
<li>Set up savings buckets that can include retirement, holidays, or big-ticket items.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Investments may be:<ul>
<li>Guaranteed, in which some or all of the principal is guaranteed to be repaid to the investor;</li>
<li>For some kinds of investments, some growth may also be guaranteed;</li>
<li>Non-guaranteed, in which neither principal nor profit is guaranteed to be repaid;</li>
<li>Examples of guaranteed investments include Guaranteed Investment Certificates, and some bonds;</li>
<li>Examples of non-guaranteed investments include stocks, mutual funds, and real estate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Jean is 78 years old and relies on the returns from her investments to generate income to support her in retirement. Her investments, combined with her pensions, allow her to live comfortably. Jean feels that she cannot afford to risk her invested money in an investment that would not pay both her principal plus the stated return. Therefore, Jean chooses guaranteed investments to ensure that she will not experience losses.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="112-investment-basics">1.1.2 Investment basics<a class="headerlink" href="#112-investment-basics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Some investment fundamentals are essential to understand how investing works, how returns are generated for investors, and how investors manage risk.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1121-compounding-compound-interest">1.1.2.1 Compounding (compound interest)<a class="headerlink" href="#1121-compounding-compound-interest" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Compounding refers to earning interest on an investment. When the interest is paid, it is reinvested in the investment. The next interest payment is based on the principal and interest already received. As a result, the investor earns interest on interest.</li>
<li>This form of interest is called compound interest.</li>
<li>Withdrawals reduce the effect of compounding. To maximize compounding, all investment returns must be reinvested. As Table 1.1 shows, compound interest achieves escalated investment growth.</li>
<li>
<p>Table 1.1 Investment growth escalated by compound interest
<img alt="picture 99" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dekingtt/statics/images/2022-01-07-04-97.png" />  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since compounding works better over a longer time period, younger investors have an advantage. This is why advisors recommend that individuals start saving as early in life as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>Compounding can also work negatively. For example, costs, such as debt with unpaid balances where interest is charged, can also compound.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1122-investment-returns">1.1.2.2 Investment returns<a class="headerlink" href="#1122-investment-returns" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>All investments have one of three types of return:<ul>
<li>Investment returns can be positive and generate profits;</li>
<li>Returns can be neutral where an investor receives the original principal, but no profit;</li>
<li>Returns can be negative where the investor loses money on the investment—this is a risk of investing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The “rate of return” is expressed as a percentage of the principal or amount invested. This percentage can be positive or negative depending on the performance of the investment.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Salim invests $10,000 but receives $11,000 when he sells the investment. The $1,000 profit ( $11,000 – $10,000) is a 10% rate of return ( $1,000 ÷ $10,000).</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, investors may be informed of the expected rate of return on an investment before they invest. In others, it is impossible to tell investors what to expect because the return is unknown. This is a characteristic of a risky investment.</li>
<li>Investing involves a scale of risk which indicates the likelihood of the investor getting their principal repaid.</li>
<li>Investment risk can range from very low risk at the bottom of the scale to higher risks toward the top, with speculative risk at the very top.</li>
<li>The lower the risk, the greater the likelihood of receiving back all invested money.</li>
<li>
<p>Speculative investments carry the highest level of risk. It is highly unlikely that an investor with a speculative investment will get back all of his invested money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the plus side, speculative investments can generate higher returns (and a significant profit) than lower-risk investments.</p>
</li>
<li>The risk/return theory is: reward those who are prepared to take greater risk with greater returns. Those who are able to take less risk are not similarly rewarded: less risk = lower returns.</li>
<li>Returns are classified as nominal or real.</li>
<li>A nominal return is the “named” or stated rate of return, before considering inflation.<ul>
<li>For example, a 2% return advertised for a savings account is a nominal return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A real return incorporates inflation. Its formula is:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a>Nominal return - inflation = real return
</code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>If the annual nominal return on a Guaranteed Investment Certificate is 3% and the annual rate of inflation is 1.8%, then the real rate of return on the bond is 1.2% (3% – 1.8%).</p>
</div>
<h4 id="1123-asset-classes">1.1.2.3 Asset classes<a class="headerlink" href="#1123-asset-classes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Investments can have similar characteristics and be governed by similar laws and regulations. They are assigned to asset classes based on those similarities.</li>
<li>Asset classes fall into three main categories.<ul>
<li>Stocks (also called “equities”);</li>
<li>Bonds (also called “fixed income” or “debt”);</li>
<li>Cash (also called “money market instruments”).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two other classes are often added to the three main asset classes—real estate and commodities.</li>
<li>Each asset class has its own risk and return profile.<ul>
<li>Diversification mixes assets from the different asset classes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1124-diversification">1.1.2.4 Diversification<a class="headerlink" href="#1124-diversification" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Diversification is a strategy to manage risk. It spreads invested funds over the different asset classes. When asset classes and investments within those classes are combined, investing risk can be lowered, and the expected overall returns may be higher, than if all savings were put into one investment.</li>
<li>Economic conditions can vary by country. Diversification can be used to take advantage of favourable economic conditions with investments in other countries.</li>
<li>Segregated funds are a good fit for a diversified investment approach.</li>
<li>Segregated funds can be invested by their managers in a range of investments depending on the fund. For example, a segregated bond fund will invest in many different bonds that mature at different times, carry different risks, and pay out at different interest rates.</li>
<li>Mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) share similar diversification characteristics as segregated funds.</li>
<li>Since most investors lack the capital to self-diversify their holdings, investing in a fund-type investment helps them to achieve and benefit from adequate diversification.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1125-liquidity">1.1.2.5 Liquidity<a class="headerlink" href="#1125-liquidity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Investments can be termed as either “liquid” or “illiquid.”</li>
<li>Liquidity describes the ability to cash in, or sell, an investment quickly at or near its current market price</li>
<li>A liquid investment has the characteristics of liquidity. For example, a savings account is a liquid investment because some or all of its value can be quickly accessed for use.</li>
<li>An investment that does not have characteristics of liquidity is called “illiquid.” Real estate is often cited as an example of an illiquid investment, where the sale of a property may take some time to complete and can result in a price below market value.</li>
<li>Liquidity is essential in an emergency fund, in which a portion of earnings are set aside for emergency use, for example, to replace a sudden loss of income. The need will be for a timely sale at highest market value.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="113-time-value-of-money">1.1.3 Time value of money<a class="headerlink" href="#113-time-value-of-money" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The principle of time value of money is described in two ways:<ul>
<li>The present value of money (PV); and</li>
<li>The future value of money (FV).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Invested money has the potential to increase in value over time due to interest earned (or other returns). The difference in value between the same sums of money received at different times form the basis for the present and future value principles.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1131-present-value">1.1.3.1 Present value<a class="headerlink" href="#1131-present-value" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Present value (PV) is an important calculation in many financial planning activities.</li>
<li>PV works backwards from a future date. It is used to determine how much needs to be saved today to yield a specific amount in the future.</li>
<li>For example, knowing how much needs to be invested today for a retirement nest egg in 10 years’ time or calculating post-secondary education expenses.</li>
<li>Present value tells us that if $5,000 is needed at a future date, less than $5,000 needs to be saved today because today’s sum will earn interest and grow over time.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Joe’s daughter Sarah will be going to college in five years. He believes the cost of the first year’s tuition and living expenses will be $28,000. He has just been paid for a large contract he completed. He needs to do a PV calculation to tell him how much of that money to set aside now to have the $28,000 when it will be needed.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Present value can be calculated when the following are known:<ul>
<li>The future sum;</li>
<li>The future date when the sum is needed;</li>
<li>A specified interest rate between today and the future date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Financial calculators, available online, or in software provided by insurers, are used to calculate PV. PV is applied to both a sum of money and cash flows received over time.</li>
<li>
<p>The formula for PV is:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-1-1" name="__codelineno-1-1" href="#__codelineno-1-1"></a>PV = FV ÷ (1 + interest rate)ⁿ
</code></pre></div></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FV is the known future value and n is the number of time periods for the calculation (i.e., yearly, semi-annually, etc.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>

<ul>
<li>The future value (FV) calculation provides the value of a current investment at a future date, given the interest earned on the investment (i.e., how much should be put in savings or investments to be worth in x years’ time?).</li>
<li>Therefore, if a future retiree has a certain amount saved for retirement purposes, he can determine how much that amount will be worth at retirement with a future value calculation.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Both registered and non-registered accounts are available for the purpose of saving and investing. Registered accounts are individually registered in the owner’s name with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</li>
<li>Non-registered accounts are also available for savings and investing, and have flexibility for deposits and withdrawals (unlike registered accounts).</li>
<li>Registered accounts have specific features that align the account with its purpose. For example, a Registered Education Savings Plan offers government grants that help savings grow to usually help a child with post-secondary school costs.</li>
<li>Accounts serve different purposes:<ul>
<li>For retirement: Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), Registered Pension Plan (for group members), and the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA);</li>
<li>For education savings: Registered Education Savings Plan and the Tax-free Savings Account (TFSA);</li>
<li>For the disabled: Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) and the Tax-free Savings Account (TFSA).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note, the Tax-free Savings Account (TFSA) is a general savings account available for any purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These accounts hold the investment choices of the account owner.</p>
</li>
<li>For example, an RRSP could hold Guaranteed Investment Certificates, and segregated funds.</li>
<li>This means that investors can be dissatisfied with the investment choices in an account, but cannot be dissatisfied with the account type. If an investor is unsatisfied with the investments in their registered account, those investments can be removed and replaced with more suitable choices.</li>

<li>The guarantee provides that some or all of the principal will be paid back to the investor when the investment term ends;</li>
<li>Some profit may also be guaranteed to be paid to the investor;</li>
<li>Investors will know any factors of timing that may apply to their investment, that is they will know in advance when their invested money will be made available for their use;</li>

<li>Taxed at the highest rate (the same as income earned from working);</li>
<li>Foreign income including foreign dividends is taxed in the same manner as interest income.</li>

<li><strong>Dividends</strong>:<ul>
<li>Paid by companies from their earnings to their stock owners. Not all companies pay dividends, and there is no guarantee that a dividend will be paid;</li>

<li>Paid by or earned in the riskiest investments;</li>
<li>Taxed at a lower rate than interest, because only half of the gain is taxable;</li>
<li>When the investment loses value, the investor receives a capital loss. One half of the capital loss can be deducted from taxable capital gains on other investments. The loss must be used first against capital gains in the year the loss is incurred. However, if capital gains are unavailable or insufficient in that year, the capital loss may be applied against capital gains in any of the three previous years, or in any future year. Therefore, this reduces the amount of taxable capital gain and the tax to be paid on that gain.</li>

<ul>
<li>Segregated funds, also called Individual Variable Insurance Contracts (IVICs) and “seg” funds, are created and sold by life insurance companies and approved by regulators.</li>
<li>The inception date of a fund is the date on which it can first be offered to investors.</li>
<li>The assets in segregated funds are kept separate, or segregated, from other assets of the insurer. Insurers are required, by law, to set aside financial reserves so they can meet their contractual obligations for maturity and death benefit guarantees.</li>
<li>Many types of segregated funds are available, to suit different investment objectives.</li>
<li>With a segregated fund, investors deposit their savings to the fund (or funds) of their choice. The deposits create a pool of money, which is used by the segregated fund manager to acquire investments according to the type of fund they manage.<ul>
<li>For example, deposits to a bond fund are used by the segregated fund manager to buy a wide range of bonds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Segregated funds can be held in registered and non-registered accounts.</li>
<li>Segregated fund investors may face a sales fee when they invest. This charge is paid once. It may be charged up front as a front-end load (FEL) as a percentage of the sum invested or the sales fee may decline over years (called a deferred sales charge) until it is eliminated. It is charged as the percentage of the amount withdrawn if a partial or total withdrawal is made from the fund:<ul>

<ul>
<li>As a fund-type investment, segregated funds share some characteristics with other fund investments, such as mutual funds.</li>
<li>Segregated funds provide some unique features and benefits due to the fact that they are an insurance product and delivered through an insurance contract. These include:<ul>
<li>Possible creditor protection to their policy owner;</li>
<li>Beneficiaries are named;</li>
<li>Probate is bypassed.</li>
<li>Guarantees provide a benefit on death and at contract maturity;</li>
<li>Reset options;</li>
<li>Tax benefit when capital losses are incurred;</li>
<li>Assuris protection against insolvency of the insurer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some of the advantages segregated funds share with other fund investments are:<ul>
<li>There are a variety of funds;</li>
<li>Ease of investment;</li>
<li>Information readily available on funds before and after purchase;</li>
<li>Diversification provided;</li>
<li>Managed professionally;</li>
<li>Provides liquidity;</li>
<li>Ease of switching between funds;</li>
<li>Ease of redemption;</li>
<li>Ability to create an income stream from account value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Segregated fund disadvantages include:<ul>
<li>A minimum ten-year term-to-maturity for the investment contract;</li>
<li>Higher annual fees than other fund investments;</li>
<li>Possible age restrictions to entering a contract and deposits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some disadvantages segregated funds share with other fund investments are:<ul>
<li>Too many choices of funds and often little differentiation between choices;</li>
<li>Sales charges and ongoing fees charged as the MER.</li>

<ul>
<li>Only those who are life-licensed can sell segregated funds. Some segregated funds are sold by investment dealers but in that case, the dealers are acting as agents for the life insurers only.</li>
<li>A segregated fund investor:<ul>
<li>Acquires information about a segregated fund from his agent and an Information Folder provided by the insurer offering the fund;</li>
<li>Completes the application, usually with the assistance of the agent;</li>
<li>Receives the contract, provides a deposit, and signs the contract.</li>

<ul>
<li>Many types of segregated funds are offered.</li>
<li>To create segregated funds, fund managers may concentrate their investments in:<ul>
<li>Asset classes (described previously) alone or in combination.<ul>
<li>When assets are combined in one fund, a balanced fund is created.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Countries or geographical areas;</li>
<li>Other segregated funds:<ul>
<li>These are called funds of funds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All fund types are not created equal—for example, each fund that exclusively invests in stocks will hold shares of different companies. When funds hold the shares of the same companies, the amount of shares held by each fund will differ.</li>
<li>The reason so many types of funds are available is to provide a choice among levels of risk and rates of return.</li>

<ul>
<li>The word “return” has two separate meanings:</li>
<li><strong>Return describes performance.</strong><ul>
<li>When “return” is used in this way, it is stated as a percentage. That percentage is a measure of how the value has changed (up or down) since the return was last reported;</li>
<li>The percentage is arrived at by comparing growth against last-reported value;</li>
<li>The returns for segregated funds are posted monthly, every three months, year-to-date, one year, two years, five years, 10 years, and since inception.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Phil receives a statement about his segregated fund that shows his contract has a value of $10,000. The next statement shows his contract has a value of $11,000. Therefore, his return for the period has been 10% (1,000 ÷ 10,000).</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return describes the form in which growth is earned:</strong><ul>
<li>Note, these are described previously as interest, dividends, and capital gains;</li>
<li>Segregated funds can earn interest, dividends, and capital gains, which are reinvested in the fund as they are earned;</li>
<li>Registered account owners (that is, RRSP accounts) do not report returns on their annual income tax. When the time comes to make a withdrawal from their registered account, the sum investors receive is taxed at the same as income from interest, regardless of how it was actually earned (such as capital gains). This is true for taxable registered accounts (a tax-free savings account is an exception because it is not a taxable account);</li>
<li>Non-registered account owners receive the returns in the form they are earned, for example as a capital gain, and report them in that form for income tax each year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>There are two guarantees provided by segregated funds:</strong><ul>
<li>Maturity guarantee: This guarantees the investor will receive a minimum of 75% of his investment when the contract matures;<ul>
<li>If the market value is higher than 75%, the investor receives the market value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Death benefit guarantee: This guarantees the beneficiary of the contract will receive a minimum of 75% of the sum invested in the contract if the life insured dies while the contract is in force.<ul>
<li>If the market value is higher than 75%, the beneficiary receives the market value.</li>
</ul>

<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 1</p>
<p>June invests $10,000 in her segregated fund contract with a 75% maturity guarantee. When the contract matures, she will receive $7,500 ( $10,000 x 75%); or the market value if it is higher than $7,500.</p>

<p>Dane invests $10,000 in his segregated fund contract with a 75% death benefit guarantee. When he dies in year seven of the contract, it is worth $6,250. His beneficiary receives $7,500.</p>
<p>Together these guarantees limit losses. The investor knows that the maximum amount of loss they can experience is the difference between the sum invested and the guarantee amount.</p>

<ul>
<li>While the death benefit guarantee applies throughout the contract, the maturity guarantee applies only at maturity. Therefore, if the policy owner needed to terminate his policy before maturity, they would receive its market value only. This could be less or more than the sum invested.</li>
<li>The maturity guarantee may leave a non-guaranteed 25% gap between sum invested and sum guaranteed. This has the potential to deliver a 25% loss on the investment.</li>
<li>The investor must commit to the full 10-year contract to receive the maturity guarantee.</li>

<p>Assuris does not provide protection against market losses. Protection against a loss in the value of an investment is provided by the guarantees of certain investments, like the 75% segregated fund maturity guarantee.</p>

<h3 id="132-annuities">1.3.2 Annuities<a class="headerlink" href="#132-annuities" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An annuity is structured to repay a regular income over time. They are highly secure, widely available, and protected by Assuris.</li>
<li>An annuity contract is set up between the insurer and the investor. The investor names the annuitant, the person who receives the income payments.</li>
<li>Annuity payments are a combination the investor’s principal and interest paid by the insurer.</li>
<li>The annuitant may also be known as the “annuitant grantee” or “payee.”</li>
<li>The wording of different parties to a contract may differ from contract to contract. For this reason, it is very important to understand the definitions of an annuity contract.</li>
<li>The amount received by the annuitant is called an “annuity payment.” An annuity payment is usually set or “fixed” for its term; changing interest rates have no effect.</li>
<li>Several types of annuity do not have fixed annuity rates. Their payments are variable. Each guarantees a minimum payment. One form of variable annuity links to investment performance. Its payment will be the minimum payment plus any additional payment as a result of its investment performance. The other form of variable annuity, called an indexed annuity, links to the rate of inflation and increases payments in step with rising inflation. Therefore, its payment is a minimum payment adjusted for any increase in the inflation rate.</li>
<li>The contract is assigned an annuity rate, which determines how much income will be paid to the annuitant:<ul>
<li>Many factors contribute to the annuity rate. The primary factor is the interest rate in effect at the time that the annuity is purchased. Other factors that may affect the annuity payments include the age and gender of the annuitant, and the amount of money deposited to the annuity contract. Annuity rates vary between providers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Annuities can be either:<ul>
<li>Fixed—payments are guaranteed and will be received for the duration of the annuity; or</li>
<li>Not Fixed—payments are guaranteed at a minimum rate—they are “variable” and tied to the stock market, or “indexed” and tied to the rate of inflation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are two main types of annuities:<ul>
<li>Payout annuities: All annuities that pay an income are classified as payout annuities.<ul>
<li>This is what most people are referring to when an annuity is mentioned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accumulation annuities: In which savings accumulate over the term of the annuity to produce investment growth.<ul>
<li>On maturity, the investor has the choice of converting the accumulation annuity to a payout annuity.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The primary advantage of annuities is their guaranteed income stream, paid for the duration of the annuity contract (typically the lifetime of the annuitant):<ul>
<li>Investment management is taken from the hands of the investor. This simplifies annuity investment and makes annuities a good choice for investors who do not have investing expertise;</li>
<li>Annuities that are prescribed may offer some tax advantages, meaning less tax is payable in the early years of the contract;</li>
<li>Investor protection is available for insurance annuity contracts through Assuris.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The primary disadvantages of annuities are their lack of flexibility and interest rate risk:<ul>
<li>When annuity payments begin, no changes can be made to the contract. The investor will face penalties to make a withdrawal;</li>
<li>The interest rate is set in the contract. If interest rates rise—the annuity payment would increase if the annuity was purchased when higher rates were in effect—they will not be applied to an existing contract. The higher rate would only apply to contracts issued while that rate is in effect.</li>

<li>Annuities are available as either a “payout” annuity that pays an income or as an “accumulation” annuity which is used for savings. Payout annuities are the most common.</li>
<li>Payout annuities are available in three forms:<ul>
<li>A term annuity (also called a term certain annuity): payments are made over a specified period of time (the term);</li>
<li>A life annuity: payments are made for the lifetime of the annuitant;</li>
<li>A joint annuity (also called a joint and last survivor annuity): two lives are covered. Payment is made to one annuitant and on the death of that annuitant; payment is then made for the lifetime of the other annuitant.</li>

<ul>
<li>As noted above, the interest rate is set in the contract and there is no opportunity to change if interest rates go up.</li>
<li>Another risk is introduced because the set interest rate also sets income. For an annuitant who does not have an indexed annuity inflation risk may be experienced, in which costs of living increase over time but income stays the same. Inflation risk creates a loss of purchasing power for those on a set—or fixed—income. The longer the term of the annuity, the greater the impact of inflation.</li>

<li>Stocks are also called shares or equities.</li>
<li>They represent ownership in a corporation whether that corporation is privately owned or publicly traded.</li>
<li>Many indicators are used to predict whether stock prices will rise or fall. They may be macroeconomic—for example, based on the economic conditions of a region or country. Or they may be microeconomic—for example, based on a single product developed by a company.</li>
<li>Stock values also rise and fall according to investor sentiment.</li>
<li>Despite all the indicators available, no one knows for certain what will happen to the price of a stock. For this reason, they are considered risky investments:<ul>

<ul>
<li>Bonds are also called a debt investment, as they represent a debt between a borrower, who is the bond issuer, and a lender, who is the bond investor. Bonds are also called a fixed-income security.</li>
<li>Many segregated funds focus on bonds or include bonds as part of their portfolio. Therefore, it is important for life agents to understand how bonds work.</li>
<li>A bond is registered electronically when it is purchased. It consists of a face amount (the principal invested) and a coupon rate, which represents the interest paid by the bond.</li>
<li>A bond is like an IOU of a corporation or government. The investor loans the corporation or government money and receives the bond (IOU) in return.</li>
<li>Bonds are issued with a maturity date—as long as 30 years.</li>
<li>During this period, the corporation or government compensates the investor for the use of invested money by paying interest to the investor.</li>
<li>The maturity date is the date when the bond comes due for repayment by the issuer to the investor. On that date, the borrower (the issuer) repays the full principal amount to the investor.</li>
<li>An investor can sell a corporate or government bond before its maturity date to another investor.</li>
<li>An active market exists for buying and selling bonds called the secondary bond market.</li>
<li>Bonds can be held in self-directed registered accounts and non-registered accounts.</li>
<li>Bonds that are issued with a high credit rating can preserve and increase capital as well as provide a predictable stream of payments in the form of coupon or interest payments. A high credit rating indicates a low chance of the issuer defaulting on payments to investors.</li>

<ul>
<li>Why buy bonds?<ul>
<li>Bonds provide an income stream via their interest payments. They can also increase in value.</li>
<li>The bond market is vast—much larger than the stock market. This gives investors a wide range of bonds to choose from, and correspondingly, bonds are available across the risk spectrum. Investors choose among credit ratings, issuers, terms to maturity, and coupon rates (i.e., interest rates) to build a diversified portfolio aiming to get higher returns while reducing overall risk.</li>
<li>To maintain investor confidence, repayment of the face amount and interest payments are guaranteed for government bonds issued by many countries because the issuing government has government revenue at its disposal to meet its obligations.</li>
<li>Corporate bond issuers make a commitment to repay their investors for the same reason – they need investor confidence so they will be successful when they need to borrow more money via bonds in the future. There is a slightly greater chance that corporate bond payments will not be made since a corporation's fortunes can change quickly and a corporate issuer might not have the necessary capital at its disposal to repay investors.</li>
<li>Corporate bonds run the spectrum of risk and investors who are prepared to take a higher risk are rewarded with higher interest payments from the bond.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A disadvantage of bonds is that an investor must seek them out through a securities advisor, and little information is provided about price. This lack of transparency may mean that buyers overpay for a bond. Also, terminology used to describe prices and yields of bonds can be confusing to average investors.</li>

<ul>
<li>Before maturity, interest payments are made by the bond issuer, usually twice a year.</li>
<li>Interest may be fixed, floating, or payable at maturity.</li>
<li>On maturity, the face amount of the bond is repaid with any outstanding interest obligations. The amount paid is a result of the following factors:<ul>
<li>Maturity date: Bonds are issued as short-term (3 years or less to maturity), medium term (3 years to 10 years to maturity), or long-term (10 years or more);<ul>
<li>The longer the term, the higher the interest rate on the bond.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Credit quality: Bonds are rated based on the issuer's capacity to meet its financial obligations, whether that issuer is a government or a corporation. Bonds are rated according to the likelihood of repayment of face amount and payment of principal. The highest ranking bonds are called investment-grade bonds. They have an AAA rating. On the other end of the risk spectrum are bonds called high yield (because of they pay a high rate of interest) and junk bonds (because of their low rating, typically BB or lower). The return on investment-grade bonds is much lower than bonds with a higher risk of default.</li>
<li>Price: Bonds are issued at their face value, called par value. Interest rate changes will change the price of the bond in the bond market. Selling a bond above its face amount creates a capital gain. Selling below face value realizes a capital loss.</li>

<h3 id="137-mutual-funds">1.3.7 Mutual funds<a class="headerlink" href="#137-mutual-funds" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Mutual funds are created in two forms:<ul>
<li>An open-end fund issues units to its investors in proportion to the amount they have invested;</li>
<li>A closed-end fund has a fixed number of shares, which it issues to its investors. Closed-end funds are not described in this module.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The open-end mutual funds pool the deposits of investors. Just like with segregated funds, the mutual fund manager uses the pool of money to acquire investments according to the type of fund they manage.<ul>
<li>For example, money deposited to a bond fund is used by the mutual fund manager to buy a wide range of bonds;</li>
<li>There are thousands of mutual funds available for investment. The challenge for the investor and his financial advisor is to narrow down the choice to one fund, or perhaps several funds, that will be the most suitable for the investor's investment objectives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mutual-fund investors do not commit to a term for their investment. They may redeem their investment at any time and receive proceeds shortly after that.</li>
<li>Investors in a mutual fund pay three types of fees:<ul>
<li>The management expense ratio (MER), which is expressed as a percentage of the fund's assets, is paid to compensate the managers of the fund, operating expenses of the fund, and taxes;</li>
<li>The trading expense ratio (TER), which measures the trading costs of the fund, is also expressed in a percentage of assets. A higher TER is evidence of more frequent buying and selling of holdings by the portfolio manager.</li>
<li>A sales fee upon purchase (called a “front-end load”), or on a declining basis and paid when units of the fund are sold (called a “back-end load” or a “deferred sales charge” (DSC)). DSC is declines over a period of years until it is elilmintaed.</li>
<li>As of June 1, 2022, all provinces and territories except Ontario, will prohibit fund organizations from paying upfront sales commissions to dealers, eliminating DSC charges in those jurisdictions. The DSC will continue in Ontario.</li>
<li>Low-load funds are also sold where a lower fee is charged at redemption. No-load funds are also available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mutual fund managers for conventional mutual funds and exchange-traded funds use a standardized risk classification methodology.</li>
<li>Standardized risk classification methodology uses standard deviation as the risk indicator to determine a mutual fund’s investment risk level.</li>
<li>This new approach provides consistency across all fund risk assessments and allows investors to easily compare the investment risk levels of different mutual funds.
<img alt="picture 102" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dekingtt/statics/images/2022-01-07-04-788.png" />  </li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Using the standardized risk classification methodology, New Global Balanced Fund has a standard deviation of 10. This means the fund has a low to medium investment risk level.

<ul>
<li>What advantages are specific to mutual funds (and not shared with segregated funds)?<ul>
<li>The primary advantage of mutual funds compared to segregated funds is the lack of a 10-year term-to-maturity. This means an investor can easily enter and exit the investment without any penalty other than what must be paid as a sales charge.</li>
<li>Mutual funds also permit their investors to withdraw money regularly. This can create an income stream for the investor, who can set up a “systematic withdrawal plan” to provide a regular stream of income from the fund.</li>
<li>Mutual funds are also offered in the retail environment of banks, caisses populaires, and credit unions, which is a convenience factor not available to segregated fund investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the disadvantages of which investors should be aware are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mutual funds are not intended to be a short-term investment;</li>
<li>
<p>Tax complexities that arise in non-registered accounts require investors to monitor fund activity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trailing commissions, or trailer fees (also called “service fees”), are paid annually by the fund manager to sales agents. They are generally higher for funds sold with a front-end load, and for equity and balanced funds. The fee is a percentage (usually 0.25% to 1%) charged against the market value of the customer’s total assets;</p>
</li>
<li>A MER is charged by mutual funds for professional management services of the fund. This fee can erode returns significantly. The MER is calculated by annual operating expenses (which vary widely depending on the fund type) divided by the average dollar value of assets under administration.</li>
<li>Client Relationship Management 2 (CRM2): This is a recent innovation in mutual funds with regard to new rules for disclosure to clients.</li>

<li>ETFs trade the same way as shares on a stock exchange.</li>
<li>ETFs are available as an indexed form or as an actively managed form. The indexed form tracks an underlying index, like the Toronto Stock Exchange. The manager chooses investments which align with the investment objectives with an actively managed ETF.</li>
<li>There is typically a cost to ETF investors when they buy and sell their shares. This comes in the form of a sales commission which is similar to the fee charged when an investor trades stocks. Although some ETFs are available without a commission, firms that offer the “commission-free” ETFs will compensate for the absence of commissions in other ways. They may impose the purchase of a specified number of units or a dollar value per trade or require the investor to a sign up to their online investing platform.</li>
<li>Like mutual funds, an MER is also charged against ETF shares, however the MER is significantly lower than the MER of mutual funds or segregated funds. Also like mutual funds, a trading expense ratio (TER) is charged within the funds themselves for transaction costs. Active ETFs incur the highest TERs because more trading by management results in a higher total trading cost. Investors may also be charged a trailer fee by the financial advisor “managing” the ETF on their behalf.</li>

<li>Trading fees, such as commissions, are usually charged on buy and sell orders.</li>
<li>Low liquidity for infrequently traded ETFs or ETFs not traded in high volumes.</li>
<li>Complexity of the investment. ETFs are complex and successful ETF investing requires an understanding of indexing and how stock markets work.</li>
<li>The litmus test for investment suitability is the ability of the investor to describe how his money is invested, how growth is achieved, and the conditions under which his principal and returns are received. If an investor is unable to answer these questions about an ETF, then it may not be suitable for him.</li>

<li>ETFs are currently sold by ETF Facts. This document contains all the information the investor needs to base his buying decision and provides consistent disclosure about the investment, like Fund Facts does for mutual funds.

<li>Many types of ETFs are available, that track currencies, industries, style (such as growth, value or market capitalization), bonds, dividends or real estate in Canada or abroad — and there are also other, more exotic ETFs such as inverse ETFs, which moves in the opposite direction of an associated exchange or index.</li>
<li>Index-based ETFs track their target index in one of two ways.</li>
<li>A replicate index-based ETF holds every security in the target index because it invests 100 percent of its assets proportionately in all the securities in the target index.</li>
<li>A sample index-based ETF does not hold every security in the target index; instead the sponsor chooses a representative sample of securities in the target index in which to invest.</li>
<li>Actively managed ETFs have a benchmark index, used as a standard to monitor performance. They must disclose the identities and weightings of the component securities and other assets held by the ETF each business day on their publicly available websites. This provides a level of transparency unique among fund investments.</li>
<li>Managers have the ability to change sector allocations, time trades, or deviate from the index as they see fit.</li>

<li>The risk of the ETF is similar to the risk of its underlying index. Like mutual funds, they are classified by levels based on a range of standard deviation, which is a formula measuring returns. It demonstrates that the highest risk is experienced in those funds with the highest standard deviation.</li>
<li>Thus, ETFs have market risk and may have industry risk, currency risk, and liquidity risk.</li>

<ul>
<li>Real estate diversifies a portfolio.</li>
<li>Its primary advantages are the regular income it produces, the equity that builds in the property from mortgage payments, and ultimately the capital gain earned on the sale of the income property and benefit from the tax advantages on capital gains.</li>
<li>The primary disadvantages are the large sum needed to begin (including the payment for the land/property, commissions charged on real estate sales and property taxes), as many as tens of thousands of dollars are typically required for a down payment; and liquidity risk, as real estate can be difficult to sell quickly.</li>
<li>Real estate investors can also be exposed to interest rate risk if mortgage rates rise; and to market risk, when the overall market for real estate declines.</li>
<li>Another disadvantage is the ongoing expenses in the form of property maintenance, property tax, and landlord insurance. The property must be kept up to preserve the investment, and to meet obligations to renters. Tax must be paid to local authorities based on the value of the property, and insurance will be required to protect against claims that result from premises liability, fire, smoke, water damage, and vandalism. These expenses must be tracked over the entire period of ownership to reduce the capital gain on the property.</li>

<li>A real estate investor may experience interest rate risk on the mortgage for the property.

<h3 id="1311-group-plans">1.3.11 Group plans<a class="headerlink" href="#1311-group-plans" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Groups that offer savings and investment plans to their members include employers, associations, and fraternal organizations. Group plans are most often associated with employers. They participate as the subscriber or administrator of the plan. The subscriber/administrator contracts with a group plan provider, such as an insurer, in order to offer a plan to employees. The employees participate in the subscriber’s plan to accumulate savings for retirement. Participation by the employee may be mandatory or optional.</li>
<li>A group plan satisfies a very distinct objective for each of its two participants. An employer uses a plan, perhaps together with other company benefits, to attract and retains employees. A potential employee sees the group plan as a point of differentiation when weighing up a salary-plus-benefits package offered by the employer during hiring. Then, as an employee, the plan is a way to save money for retirement.</li>
<li>There are six fundamental types of group savings plans, and their features and characteristics are described later in this manual.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="13111-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-group-plans">1.3.11.1 Advantages and disadvantages of group plans<a class="headerlink" href="#13111-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-group-plans" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The members of a group plan receive assistance and encouragement to join their plan. In the case of employer-sponsored plans, the foremost advantages of joining are:</li>
<li>To receive the employer’s contribution to the individual plan;</li>
<li>Forced savings: for employer-sponsored plans, contributions are taken directly from gross income and, depending on the type of plan are not subject to payroll taxes:</li>
<li>Contributions made by an employer to a deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP) are fully tax-deductible to the employer and not subject to payroll taxes;</li>
<li>Contributions made by an employer to a defined contribution pension plan or defined benefit pension plans are fully tax-deductible to the employer.</li>
<li>Account fees are paid by the sponsor (in this case, the employer);</li>
<li>To get better potential rates of return than can be achieved in an individual plan;</li>
<li>To access to many investment tools and opportunities;</li>
<li>To receive an account/pension statement every year.</li>
<li>The disadvantages to members can be restricted investment choices and the inability to control plan changes made by the employer.</li>
<li>The group plan administrator enjoys separate advantages — primarily:</li>
<li>A significant employee benefit that can be used to attract top talent to the company;</li>
<li>Range of plans available tailored to the objectives and financial capability of the employer;</li>
<li>Tax deductibility of some of its contributions:<ul>
<li>Contributions made by an employer to a deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP) are fully tax-deductible to the employer and are not subject to payroll tax;</li>
<li>Contributions made by an employer to a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) or a define benefit pension plan (DBPP) are fully tax deductible to the employer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The ability to change the plan at will.</li>
<li>The main disadvantage to the sponsor of a defined benefit plan (DBP) is its obligation to provide a “promised” retirement pension to members. This obligation is not present for defined contribution plans, which assist the employee in building a pool of savings for retirement but do not promise any specific benefit in retirement.</li>
<li>Also, group registered retirement savings plan (GRRSP) contributions are subject to payroll tax.</li>

<ul>
<li>Details on these plans follow later in this module.</li>
<li>Plan overview:</li>
<li>Defined benefit pension plans (DBPP): unique because it is the only plan that pays an income during retirement that is known (i.e., defined) in advance to the group member;</li>
<li>Defined contribution pension plans (DCPP): Also known as the money purchase plan; the income paid during retirement is not known in advance because it is a result of member contributions and investment choices;</li>
<li>Group registered retirement savings plans (GRRSP): an RRSP for groups; each member’s income at retirement will be based on contributions and investment choices;</li>
<li>Deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP): profits of the employer are shared with employees to form plan contributions; each member’s income at retirement will be based on contributions and investment choices;</li>
<li>Tax-free savings account: a TFSA for groups to provide tax-free income; each member’s income at retirement will be based on contributions and investment choices;</li>
<li>Pooled registered pension plans (PRPP): a plan for small business employees and the self-employed to save for retirement; each member’s income at retirement will be based on contributions and investment choices. (Note that PRPP legislation varies from province to province.)</li>

<ul>
<li>Payments received from a group plan are taxed as interest income.</li>
<li>A defined benefit pension plan (DBPP) offers a guaranteed income in retirement but only if the plan is fully funded.</li>
<li>A fully funded plan is one in which the sponsor has made all the contributions to the plan for all plan members according to the actuarial obligation of the plan.</li>
<li>Some employers have pension shortfalls because they have not made the required contributions. This means their pension liabilities are greater than their ability to pay. Pensioners could receive less than the amount of pension promised to them.</li>

<li>Business conditions may worsen and funding the plan may be difficult, creating a shortfall.</li>

<ul>
<li>When a plan member (an employee) is responsible for making his own investment decisions, as he would in a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) or a group registered retirement savings plan (GRRSP), then he faces investment risks such as interest rate risk, inflation risk, and market risk.</li>
<li>The savings in a group plan are locked-in until retirement. This means that, unlike investing in an RRSP, there is no spending flexibility because withdrawals cannot be made before retirement. All provinces provide “unlocking” provisions in the event of financial hardship or other proven need, but the retiree must prove that the funds are needed. This is a good reason for an individual who is enrolled in a locked-in plan to also save in a plan that can provide immediate access to funds, such as an RRSP or a TFSA.</li>

<ul>
<li>Provinces and territories administer pensions through their financial institutions commissions or the government ministry responsible for the pension benefits act in their jurisdiction.</li>
<li>These acts protect the rights and benefits of plan members. Some jurisdictions provide a guaranteed minimum income to plan beneficiaries who experience shortfalls due to underfunding. For example, in Ontario, the Pension Benefits Guarantee Fund insures pensions up to $1,500/month.</li>

<h3 id="143-inflation-risk">1.4.3 Inflation risk<a class="headerlink" href="#143-inflation-risk" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Inflation risk is also known as purchasing power risk. Inflation is an increase in the cost of goods and services as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).</li>
<li>To calculate the real rate of return of an investment, inflation has to be factored in.</li>
<li>When the rate of return is lower than the rate of inflation, the investor suffers a loss in purchasing power. This means that the same amount of cash will be able to purchase fewer goods in the future due to the higher prices.</li>
<li>Inflation compounds year over year as prices are inflated over already inflated prices. This makes long-term investments especially vulnerable to inflation risk.</li>
<li>Investments that are most affected by inflation are those whose returns are tied to a specified rate of interest, such as cash in savings accounts, GICs, bonds, and money market funds. Annuities also experience inflation risk. Segregated funds that experience inflation risk are money market funds, and those invested in bonds.</li>
<li>To avoid or decrease inflation risk, the return on an investment must be at a minimum equal to the rate of inflation. Thus, the investors’ funds increase in proportion to inflation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Assume that the average rate of return on a one-year Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) on sale today is 2.20%. The inflation rate for this year is 1.8%. Therefore, if we assume the inflation rate will be the same for the next year, the real rate of return on the GIC is 0.4% (2.20% – 1.8%). The GIC is barely keeping ahead of inflation.</p>

<ul>
<li>If an investment that pays interest is locked into a fixed interest rate, then an investor cannot take advantage of higher interest rates if interest rates increase.</li>
<li>This is interest rate risk, inherent in all investments that pay fixed rates of interest.</li>
<li>Interest rate risk is experienced with inflation risk.</li>
<li>Interest rate risk occurs in bond pricing. The market value of a bond is less when interest rates rise. As interest rates rise, bond prices decline, and as interest rates fall, bond prices go up.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Assume that the interest earned on a three-year GIC is 3.00%. The interest rate that applies to GICs increases to 3.40% nine months after the GIC is purchased. The investor cannot benefit from the rise in interest rates. He is tied to the lowest rate for the balance of the term.</p>

<p>When the coronavirus pandemic started seriously impacting North America in March 2020, creating fear and uncertainty, there were negative effects on both the equity and bond markets. On March 12, 2020, the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index had its biggest single-day decline since 1940, losing 12.34%, a loss of 1,761.64 points. The bond market had already plummeted during February and early March, reaching its low point on March 9. Markets around the world all re-acted to the pandemic with huge declines.</p>
<p>For geopolitical reasons, the price of oil had already fallen 51.6% during the previous year. In February 2020, the price of Brent crude was US $55.66 per barrel; in March it was US $32.01.</p>
