<ul>
<li>The many advantages of segregated funds include the following:<ul>
<li>Guarantees;</li>
<li>Growth secured by reset;</li>
<li>Funding flexibility;</li>
<li>Guaranteed income;</li>
<li>Professional management;</li>
<li>Diversification;</li>
<li>Tax benefits;</li>
<li>Switches between funds;</li>
<li>Ability to withdraw funds;</li>
<li>Exemption from probate fees;</li>
<li>Investor protection;</li>
<li>Creditor protection;</li>
<li>Absence of medical underwriting; and</li>
<li>Right of rescission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These benefits will be discussed in the following pages.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="211-guarantees">2.1.1 Guarantees<a class="headerlink" href="#211-guarantees" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Segregated funds provide two guarantees that protect the investor from losing money on their principal:<ul>
<li>A maturity guarantee; and</li>
<li>A death benefit guarantee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The maturity guarantee is a minimum return to the investor of 75% of deposits providing the investor’s contract is in force until its maturity date, 10 years from when it began.</li>
<li>The death benefit guarantee applies throughout the entire term of the contract. It applies when the annuitant dies during the contract, and is equal to, at least, 75% of the sum deposited to the contract.</li>
<li>Withdrawals from the contract reduce the sum on which the guarantees are calculated, but the percentages (75%/75%) remain the same.</li>
<li>Segregated Funds</li>
<li>To best understand the guarantees, it is important to understand the roles of the parties to the contract.</li>
<li>There are three parties:<ul>
<li>The first party is the person whose money (the principal) is deposited to the contract. This is the policy owner. He makes the investment decisions pertaining to the contract. He may also make withdrawals. The policy owner receives the policy proceeds when the contract matures and, therefore, is the person who benefits from the maturity guarantee;</li>
<li>The second party to the contract is the annuitant. If the policy owner buys the segregated fund contract in an RRSP or a RRIF, he must be the annuitant of the policy. If the policyowner buys the contact in a non-registered, also called a taxable, account, the annuitant can be any person named by the policy owner;</li>
<li>The beneficiary is the third party to the contract. The policy owner names the beneficiary of the contract. When the annuitant dies, the beneficiary receives an amount that is equal to, at least, 75% of the initial deposit. Therefore, the beneficiary benefits from the death benefit guarantee.</li>
<li>Note: the policy owner is the person who owns the contract and pays the premiums or deposit. The annuitant is the person on whose life the contract is based — that is, when the annuitant dies during the contract, the death benefit is paid. The annuitant and the policy owner may, or may not, be the same person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some contracts are structured to offer 100% guarantees. Often these contracts are based on a longer term-to-maturity, such as 15 years. Some modern segregated funds extend the maturity date to age 100 of the policyowner.</li>
<li>Maturity and death benefit guarantees are always stated with the maturity guarantee first, followed by the death benefit guarantee. For example, when they are equal, the guarantees are stated as 75%/75%. When the maturity guarantee is less than the death benefit guarantee, the guarantees are stated as 75%/100%.</li>
<li>If the market value of the contract at maturity or death is less than the guarantee, the insurer makes up the difference so that the amount paid out is equal to the guarantee. This is often referred to as a “top-up.”</li>
<li>The life insurance agent assists the client in choosing the contract that is most suitable for the investor’s needs and objectives.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2111-maturity-guarantee">2.1.1.1 Maturity guarantee<a class="headerlink" href="#2111-maturity-guarantee" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The maturity guarantee applies on the maturity date of the contract;</li>
<li>The maturity date is usually 10 years, never less, from the time the first deposit (or premium) is paid to the insurer, although some contracts offer maturity dates longer than ten years. Contracts with longer terms to maturity typically offer a guarantee higher than 75%.</li>
<li>The maturity guarantee limits investment risk for the policyholder by establishing a minimum contract value payable at maturity, known as downside protection.</li>
<li>There is no maximum to what the value may be. This is called unlimited upside potential.</li>
<li>On maturity of the contract, the policy owner may:</li>
<li>Withdraw the value of the investment:<ul>
<li>If the market value is greater than the guarantee value, the policy owner receives the market value;</li>
<li>If the market value is less than the guarantee value, the policy owner receives the guarantee value;</li>
<li>When the market value is less than the guarantee value, the insurer “tops up” the market value to equal the value of the maturity guarantee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extend the contract and leave the investment in place:<ul>
<li>A “top-up” by the insurer is attributed to the account to bring its value up to the level of the maturity guarantee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the contract is surrendered before the maturity date:<ul>
<li>It does not receive the benefit of maturity guarantees;</li>
<li>The policy owner receives the market value of the units minus any sales charge that may apply. The market value of the units may be greater than, equal to or less than the value of the units when the deposit was made. There is no guarantee regarding their value;</li>
<li>The maturity guarantee is reduced by withdrawals made during the term of the contract;</li>
<li>The policy owner receives the market value of the units when the withdrawal is made;</li>
<li>If a withdrawal is made during the period that the sales charge applies, the applicable charges are deducted from the withdrawal.

<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Michael invests $10,000 in a segregated fund with a 75% maturity guarantee. The guarantee at maturity is $7,500 ( $10,000 × 75%).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong> 1</li>
<li>At maturity, the fund has a market value of $8,360. This is greater than the maturity guarantee, and it is the sum Michael receives.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong> 2</li>
<li>At maturity, the fund has a market value of $6,360. This is less than the maturity guarantee. Michael receives $7,500, which comprises the market value plus a guarantee top-up of $1,140 ( $7,500 – $6,360).</li>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong> 3</li>
<li>After four years Michael surrenders the contract. The fund has a market value of $7,120, and this is the sum Michael receives. Michael does not receive the benefit of the maturity guarantee because he has surrendered the contract before its maturity date.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4 id="2112-death-benefit-guarantee">2.1.1.2 Death benefit guarantee<a class="headerlink" href="#2112-death-benefit-guarantee" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The death benefit guarantee is a near-duplicate of the maturity guarantee.</li>
<li>It applies throughout the entire term of the contract.<ul>
<li>If the annuitant dies during the contract, the beneficiary receives an amount that is equal to 75% at least, (up to 100% based on the contract), of the initial deposit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The amount paid as the death benefit is the greater of the contract’s market value or specified guarantee (75% or 100%)—just like the maturity guarantee.</li>
<li>And, just like the maturity guarantee, if the market value is less than the death benefit guarantee, the insurer makes up the difference between the two amounts so that the guaranteed amount is received.</li>
<li>There are four advantages to the death benefit guarantee:<ul>
<li>The beneficiary is protected from fund losses throughout the term of the contract, just like the maturity guarantee protects the policy owner.</li>
<li>The guarantee applies from day one of the contract and applies throughout the length of the contract.</li>
<li>Segregated funds do not require medical underwriting. Therefore, an older person or a person in ill health does not need to be concerned about poor market conditions at the time of his death. The guarantee gives him peace of mind that his beneficiary will receive at least 75% of deposits.</li>
<li>Like the maturity guarantee, there is no limit to how much the beneficiary might receive (more than the guarantee) if market conditions are favourable and unit values are high at the time of death.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Withdrawals made during the contract can reduce the amount received by the beneficiary because the sum on which the guarantee would have been based is adjusted downward by the withdrawal.</li>
<li>The death benefit may also be reduced by a sales charge. Some insurers waive the charge when the contract ends due to death.</li>
<li>The value of the investment is further enhanced because it will not be subject to probate fees if there is a named beneficiary that is not the estate of the deceased.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Keith is the policy owner and annuitant of a segregated fund contract with a 75% death benefit guarantee. Keith funded the contract with a $10,000 bonus he received from his employer. The death benefit guarantee is, therefore, $7,500 ( $10,000 × 75%). His wife, Patricia, is the beneficiary of the contract. Keith dies during the ninth year of the contract.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong> 1</li>
<li>At the time of Keith’s death, the market value of the contract is $12,640. Patricia receives that amount since it is greater than the death benefit guarantee of $7,500.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong> 2</li>
<li>At the time of Keith’s death, the market value of the contract is $6,300, which is less than the guaranteed amount ( $7,500). Patricia receives the death benefit guarantee of $7,500, which represents the market value of $6,300 plus a top-up of $1,200 ( $7,500 – $6,300).</li>

<h3 id="212-growth-secured-by-reset">2.1.2 Growth secured by reset<a class="headerlink" href="#212-growth-secured-by-reset" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Some insurers offer resets on their segregated funds. When it is offered, a reset allows the policy owner to take advantage of an increase in the market value of the fund.</li>
<li>
<p>How does a reset work?</p>
<ul>
<li>As the market value of the fund increases, reset locks in this increased value. The maturity and death benefit guarantees are based on the new contract value.</li>
<li>For example, an investor deposits $20,000 in a segregated fund. The 75% maturity and death benefit guarantees are $15,000 ( $20,000 × 75%). If the market value increases to $50,000 in the fourth year of the contract, the guarantees will be $37,500 ( $50,000 × 75%) if the contract is reset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reset has two effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>It increases the value of guarantees;</li>
<li>It changes the contract’s maturity date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reset changes the maturity date of the contract. The new maturity date of the contract is ten years from the reset date.<ul>
<li>For example, a contract that is reset in year 4 will mature ten years from that reset date (a total of 14 years since the date the contract was taken out).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some insurers offer an automatic reset on segregated fund contracts in which the insurer automatically locks-in growth of the account value. Others require the policy owner to make and implement the decision to reset.</li>
<li>Therefore, reset may be attractive to an investor who is oriented towards fund growth and increasing his investment returns. However, reset may not appeal to an investor who has a 10-year time horizon for his investment.</li>
<li>Not all insurers offer reset on their segregated funds. If reset is available, and it is up to the policy owner to make the reset decision, the owner is not required to reset the contract. The policy owner may not want to extend the maturity date of the contract.</li>
<li>An additional fee may be charged annually to contracts in which reset is permitted.</li>
<li>Also, an insurer may offer to reset on the maturity guarantee, separately from the death benefit guarantee. If so, the investor could choose to reset the maturity guarantee but not the death benefit guarantee, or vice versa.</li>
<li>The insurer provides information regarding the number of resets allowed and the mechanisms to request or accept a reset in the fund’s information folder provided at the time of sale of the fund.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 1</p>
<p>An investor deposits $20,000 in a segregated fund. The 75% maturity and death benefit guarantees are $15,000 ( $20,000 × 75%). If the market value increases to $50,000 in the fourth year of the contract, the guarantees will now amount to $37,500 ( $50,000 × 75%) if the contract is reset.</p>

<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 2</p>
<p>Hassan deposits $5,000 to a segregated fund contract with a 75% maturity guarantee and 75% death benefit guarantee. Each guarantee is worth $3,750. ( $5,000 × 75%). After two years, the market value of the contract is $7,000. Hassan’s contract offers reset and he chooses to reset the contract. This increases the maturity and death benefit guarantees to $5,250 ( $7,000 × 75%) and resets the maturity date of the contract. His contract now matures 10 years from the reset date (12 years from the time of the initial deposit).</p>

<ul>
<li>A segregated fund contract typically returns its investment as a lump-sum payment. Alternatively, a contract may create a guaranteed stream of payments.</li>
<li>Such a contract (or “income benefit plan”) is available in two forms.<ul>
<li>The Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) plan pays over a specified period of time;</li>
<li>The Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (GLWB) plan pays for life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The segregated fund contract may be issued in one of these forms or this feature may be added to an existing contract.</li>
<li>Like all segregated funds, withdrawal benefit plans provide a maturity and death benefit guarantee.</li>
<li>These plans are differentiated by the guaranteed payments they provide which is one reason that withdrawal benefit plans are attractive to retirees.</li>
<li>Not all insurers offer contracts with regular withdrawal benefits. Also, there are many features, options, and restrictions that differ between these plans as offered by different insurers.</li>

<ul>
<li>Both the GMWB and GLWB plans are based on an initial deposit or deposits by an investor to a segregated fund contract.</li>
<li>Investors may begin making withdrawals immediately after entering into a contract, or they may choose to wait before starting to make withdrawals. Those who wait have two phases to their plans:<ul>
<li>A savings phase; and</li>
<li>A payout phase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The savings phase is a period when savings accumulate:<ul>
<li>During the savings phase, investors receive the potential for increase in fund market value;</li>
<li>They also earn a credit for every year in which a withdrawal is not made;</li>
<li>The credit is based on a percentage of the initial deposit. For instance, the credit may be 5%;</li>
<li>The initial deposit plus the annual credits form a base on which a guaranteed minimum withdrawal is based;</li>
<li>Any withdrawals during the savings phase reduce the value of the initial deposit, as well as the corresponding credits and final guaranteed minimum withdrawal amount.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The payout phase starts when withdrawals begin:<ul>
<li>During the payout phase, the investor receives an annual income based on the guaranteed minimum withdrawal balance created during the savings phase;</li>
<li>The amount received is based on the payout beginning at a specified age and lasting for either a specific period, such as 20 years or for life;</li>
<li>A lifetime payout will be at a lower rate than if income is taken for a specified period because the contract value is stretched over a longer time. This is similar to the payment made from a life annuity compared to a term annuity;</li>
<li>Lifetime income appeals to those who are concerned about outliving their financial resources or who seek an income stream during retirement. This is also similar to the reasons clients choose life annuities;</li>
<li>As withdrawals are received, the value of the contract declines;</li>
<li>However, the annual income guarantee is not affected. The same annual income is received even if the market value decreases;</li>
<li>Extra withdrawals can be made that exceed the guaranteed income payment. They may be penalized with fees;</li>
<li>The payout value may be reset every three years. Reset creates a potential for increased income if the market value of the contract has increased, provided additional withdrawals have not been made;</li>
<li>The payout also increases if more premiums are contributed after the initial deposit.</li>
<li>One of the risks faced by retirees is the risk that they might outlive their financial resources. This is called longevity risk. Lifetime income appeals to those with this concern and is why individuals buy guaranteed lifetime withdrawal plans, and life annuities. Both products address longevity risk.</li>

<li>Segregated funds employ professional investment managers to provide investment management and advice.</li>
<li>These managers are compensated by fees, which are part of the management expense ratio (MER) charged against fund assets to investors.</li>
<li>The investment managers are hired by the insurance company offering the segregated fund or funds. The insurer retains the right to appoint or change a manager. A management change is reported to investors.</li>
<li>Even though the fund is managed by professional investment managers, the life agent is still responsible for working with the client to ensure the client’s objectives are being met in the fund investment.</li>

<ul>
<li>Segregated funds are highly diversified investments. This means their managers use a wide range of investments suitable to the type of fund. For example, an equity fund is highly diversified because it holds shares of many companies.</li>
<li>Diversification is a key to investing success. It lessens risk for the average investor since risk is spread over all the investments held in the fund. And, even in the unlikely event that all diversified assets in a segregated fund were to lose all their value, the segregated fund investor would be protected to a maximum loss by his maturity and death benefit guarantee.</li>

<h3 id="217-tax-benefit-of-allocations">2.1.7 Tax benefit of allocations<a class="headerlink" href="#217-tax-benefit-of-allocations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Segregated-fund investing creates value for an investor in two ways:<ul>
<li>Market value of the investment may increase; and</li>
<li>An investor may receive allocations from a fund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mutual funds distribute income; segregated funds allocate income.</li>
<li>When an investor makes a deposit to a segregated fund, the investor receives an assigned number of units.<ul>
<li>The number of units received is a result of how much is invested and their fair market value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is essential for the investor to know the value of units when they are assigned if the investor wishes to follow performance and monitor an increase in the units’ value. An increase may indicate that a reset is in order.</li>
<li>The number of units assigned to the investor does not change unless additional deposits or withdrawals are made.</li>
<li>However, unit value changes. It increases and decreases in step with the value of assets held within the fund.<ul>
<li>For example, an investor invests $1,000 in ZYX fund, in which units have a market value of $10; that investor is assigned 100 units ( $1,000 ÷ $10). If the market value of the units increases to $12, the investment will be valued at $1,200 ( $12 × 100).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A unit value is determined for each fund offered by an insurer. The value is called the NAVPU or net asset value per unit (the term NAV, or net asset value, is also used). It is calculated as:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a>NAVPU = (total value of assets - liabilities) ÷ number of units outstanding
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>NAVPU is determined on each valuation day. For a fund investing in Canadian equities, a valuation day is when the Toronto Stock Exchange is open.</li>
<li>Therefore, if a valuation shows an increase in NAVPU, the market value of the investment has increased.</li>
<li>Allocations also benefit the segregated fund investor.</li>
<li>Investment growth is generated in the form of interest, dividends, and capital gains. These earnings are not distributed to investors in the form of cash. If an investor wants cash from the fund, they must make a withdrawal by redeeming fund units.</li>
<li>The interest, dividends, and capital gains earned by a fund are reinvested in that fund. They increase unit value and increase the investor’s adjusted cost base (ACB) per unit. The ACB is a calculation that determines the tax cost of an investment to its investor. Increasing the ACB reduces tax when the units are sold.</li>
<li>The investor receives the earnings on a flow-through basis. This means:<ul>
<li>Interest earned in the fund is reported for tax purposes to the investor as interest;</li>
<li>Dividends earned are reported as dividends.</li>
<li>Dividends from Canadian corporations are taxed at a lower rate than interest due to the dividend tax credit.</li>
<li>Capital gains and losses are reported as capital gains and losses.</li>
<li>Capital losses are used to reduce capital gains in the year in which the loss occurs. If a loss cannot be fully used in that year, it can be carried back to the three previous years or forward indefinitely.</li>
<li>Capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than other investments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Henry invests $1,000 in WWW Segregated Fund Series B on September 1 in his non-registered account. He is assigned 200 units on the basis that each unit is worth $5 ( $1,000 ÷ $5 = 200). At the end of the year, a $100 allocation is made to Henry’s policy and the unit value is fixed at $6 due to fund growth. Henry now has 200 units worth $1,200, and each unit is worth $6 ( $1,200 ÷ 200). The ACB of Henry’s policy is now $1,100: the initial $1,000 investment plus the $100 allocation.</p>
<p>The $100 allocation Henry received is reported on a tax slip issued by the insurer to Henry as $50 in interest and $50 in capital gain. The interest is taxed at Henry’s marginal tax rate. The capital gain is also taxed at his marginal rate, but only 50% of the gain is taxable ( $50 × 50% = $25).</p>
<p>If Henry’s marginal tax rate is 36%, he pays $18 tax on the interest he receives ( $50 × 36% = $18). He pays $9 income tax on the capital gain ( $25 × 36% = $9).</p>

<ul>
<li>An investor who wants to switch their account value from one segregated fund to another may do so.</li>
<li>Why would an investor switch?<ul>
<li>To a fund that better matches the investor’s risk tolerance;</li>
<li>For better performance;</li>
<li>For lower fees, such as MER;</li>
<li>For a fund that better suits their investment objectives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The investor must be provided with the same information documents for the new fund as were received at the initial purchase before the switch occurs. This includes both the information folder and Fund Facts for the new fund.</li>
<li>When the switch is made, the value of the existing fund units is determined on the valuation date, which is either the day of the switch request or the following day. This is the sum that will be used to acquire units in the new fund. There is typically a minimum amount that can be transferred.</li>
<li>Contract guarantees are not affected by fund switches.</li>
<li>The number of switches the investor may make per year without incurring a switching fee may be limited.</li>
<li>Individual funds state their switching policy, including any fees for switching in the information folder provided to the investor.</li>
<li>An investor may incur a tax liability when a switch is made.</li>
<li>An investor who switches funds where each fund charges the same load (e.g., a front-end load (FEL), will not incur a fee for the switch). However, there may be a fee for switching between funds with dissimilar loads (e.g., a deferred sales charge (DSC) to a FEL).</li>

<ul>
<li>The investor enters into the segregated fund contract with the intention of seeing the contract mature in, at least, ten years, i.e., the term of the initial guarantee.</li>
<li>However, if his financial circumstances change during the ten-year period, he may find he needs to make a withdrawal from the contract to receive cash in hand. A withdrawal is also known as redemption.</li>
<li>
<p>A withdrawal can be made at any time. This provides investment flexibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The withdrawal process begins when the investor informs the insurer of the amount the investor wishes to withdraw. The investor redeems the number of units that will provide the desired sum of money based on the market value of the units. The market value is determined at the valuation day following the request. The investor receives the money from the insurer within days of the valuation date.</p>
</li>
<li>If the contract is issued with a DSC, the charge in force at the time of the withdrawal applies to the amount withdrawn. It reduces the amount the investor receives.<ul>
<li>For example, if the DSC applies for six years and is stated at 2% in contract year four, then 2% is charged on the amount of the withdrawal made in year four.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The maturity guarantee and death benefit guarantee of the contract are reduced by the withdrawal. The insurer calculates the new guarantees according to the terms of the contract.</li>
<li>A withdrawal may trigger tax. The contract owner receives a tax reporting slip from the insurer so that the withdrawal may be taken into consideration in the tax return for that year.</li>

<ul>
<li>Probate is a process in which the will of a deceased person is proven to be valid and the person appointed as executor of the will is accepted. It occurs in the provincial “home” court of the deceased and is finalized when “Letters Probate” or an equivalent document is issued.</li>
<li>Probate fees are a charge by the province or territory against the value of a deceased’s estate.<ul>
<li>Québec does not charge probate fees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Probate fees must be paid by the estate of the deceased before any property can be inherited as specified in the will. These fees can significantly reduce estate value in a province, such as B.C, that does not put an upper-end cap on probate fees.</li>
<li>Probate fees are not charged:<ul>
<li>To a trust;</li>
<li>When a surviving spouse inherits assets;</li>
<li>When the beneficiary of a segregated fund contract is not the estate. Instead, a named beneficiary receives the proceeds from the contract probate-free. A named beneficiary can include the spouse, parents, children, and grandchildren of the contract owner or annuitant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, if the estate receives the proceeds, they become part of the total estate value and subject to probate fees.</li>
<li>Probate also slows down distributions of assets. Because a segregated fund bypasses probate, its account value can be received by the beneficiary within days instead of the months it takes when an estate must go through probate.</li>

<li>Commodity;</li>
<li>Other.</li>

<li>This list of categories is helpful to start to understand the many types of funds since each class shares certain characteristics.</li>
<li>Also, many funds have subcategories that narrow their investment objective.</li>
<li>Why is it important to understand the classification of a fund?<ul>
<li>Classification is important so that funds can be correctly compared and aligned with investor risk tolerance.</li>
<li>For example, if an investor has a low risk tolerance, then they will not be suited for a fund classed as an equity fund. A better choice will be a lower-risk fund, such as a bond fund invested in government bonds.</li>

<li>Fixed-income securities pay a specific return periodically and they return principal invested at maturity.</li>
<li>Fixed-income funds may be categorized according to the duration of the bonds held by the fund. For instance, the bonds in a short-term bond fund mature in less than 3.5 years. Bonds in a medium-term fund mature between 3.5 and 9.0 years, and bonds in a long-term bond fund mature in 9.0 years or longer.</li>

<li>Fund growth is achieved when stocks held by the funds are sold at a higher price than their purchase price and by reinvesting dividends paid on fund holdings. The increase in price is the capital gain on the stock.</li>

<li>Real estate equity funds must invest at least 90% of their assets in retail, commercial, industrial and residential properties. They earn income from mortgages and have the potential for capital gains as property values increase. Real estate funds own property; mortgage funds do not.</li>
<li>Some funds invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs), companies that, in turn, invest in real estate.</li>
<li>The risk of each fund will be a result of the types of properties in which the fund invests and their location.</li>
<li>Real estate funds are particularly suitable for long-term investments because property values need to be given enough time to rise in value.</li>
<li>Real estate is an illiquid investment—it may not be possible to sell or sell at the desired price to redeem invested money.</li>

<ul>
<li>An index fund mirrors an index, such as the S&amp;P/TSX Composite index, and invests in the same stocks that are listed on the index. Therefore, if the index rises, the index fund will also rise. Its results will be slightly less than the actual index because of the fees that are charged to the fund. This style of investing is known as “passive” investing as the investment manager mimics the index chosen for his particular fund and maintains the same securities in the same weight.</li>
<li>There are many indexes on which funds may be based. They include equities, bonds, commodities, currency, and real estate among others.</li>
<li>The risk of a fund is a result of the underlying market the fund tracks.</li>

<ul>
<li>A “fund of funds” is a fund that invests in other funds.</li>
<li>The purpose of this approach is to benefit from managerial expertise in other funds and to diversify.</li>
<li>The fund manager decides which funds suit the portfolio based on the fund objective and the manager rebalances holdings as needed to maintain the objective focus.</li>
<li>The risk of the fund is entirely a result of the underlying funds in the portfolio and its investment objective.</li>

<h3 id="2212-specialty-funds">2.2.12 Specialty funds<a class="headerlink" href="#2212-specialty-funds" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Some funds are created to appeal to specific investor wants and needs. They are called “specialty funds.”</li>
<li>Specialty fund categories, such as ethical funds, fill important investment objectives for their investors.</li>
<li>Ethical funds provide an alternative for investors who for religious, political, environmental or moral reasons find the holdings of standard funds unacceptable for investment. Investors who seek ethical funds are less concerned about the risk of the fund since their primary goal is to support a cause or belief.</li>
<li>Other specialty funds include emerging market funds or funds that seek companies that are struggling financially.</li>
<li>The risk of specialty funds lies with the fund’s objective and investment strategy used by the fund manager. Each one should be carefully studied to determine if its risk is suitable for the investor.</li>

<ul>
<li>Industry-specific funds represent the belief an investment manager has in the financial prospects for an existing or new industry, service, or product.</li>
<li>The risk of industry-specific funds depends on the industry that forms the basis of the fund, its volatility, and its prospects.</li>

<ul>
<li>Certain funds focus on investments:<ul>
<li>Within a country (e.g., Canada);</li>
<li>Outside the boundaries of a country (e.g., North America);</li>
<li>Of a selection of countries (e.g., international);</li>
<li>Of a region (e.g., Asia);</li>
<li>Of part of a region (e.g., Asia except Japan);</li>
<li>Of the entire globe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Countries change in their appeal to investors over time. Some become very attractive investment opportunities while others lose their appeal.</li>
<li>Political volatility is a risk associated with investing outside Canada and similarly developed nations.</li>
<li>Currency risk is another risk of investing abroad.</li>
<li>Investors who seek foreign opportunities should be well aware of the political situation and economic stability of the country or region in which they plan to invest. They should also monitor changes that might affect the investment (e.g., an election).</li>

<li>The limitations of segregated funds will be discussed in the following pages and include:<ul>
<li>Risk to capital;</li>
<li>Sales charges;</li>
<li>Management expense;</li>
<li>Penalties; and</li>
<li>Age restrictions for acquisition.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="231-risk-to-capital">2.3.1 Risk to capital<a class="headerlink" href="#231-risk-to-capital" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The principal risk of segregated funds is that the investor could lose up to 25% of their capital when the contract provides 75% maturity and death benefit guarantees.</li>
<li>Another risk is the fixed term-to-maturity period of the standard contract. This makes segregated fund investing a long-term investment.</li>
<li>If the investor needs to make a withdrawal before the contract matures, they do not receive the benefit of the maturity guarantee and receive market value for the withdrawal minus any outstanding fees and charges, such as the deferred sales charge (DSC).</li>
<li>Risks associated with segregated fund investing also depend on the types of investments held in the fund itself. For example, bonds are lower risk than equities. Therefore, a bond fund is lower risk than an equity fund.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="232-sales-charge">2.3.2 Sales charge<a class="headerlink" href="#232-sales-charge" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The charge paid by investors to compensate the agent is called a “sales charge” or a “load.”</li>
<li>Sales agents may be compensated for their time, skill, and effort through a direct charge paid by investors and indirectly through a trailing commission.</li>
<li>The charge paid by investors is known as a “sales charge” or a “load.”</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2321-front-end-sales-charge">2.3.2.1 Front-end sales charge<a class="headerlink" href="#2321-front-end-sales-charge" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A front-end sales charge is a fee charged at the beginning of the contract, known as its front end.</li>
<li>The front-end sales charge is also called a “front-end load” (FEL).</li>
<li>The fee is charged to the client as a percentage of the amount the investor deposits to the segregated fund contract. It reduces the amount of investment dollars that go to work for the client.</li>
<li>However, the client has no future fees to anticipate. Both the maturity guarantee and death benefit guarantee are based on the amount of deposit before the FEL is deducted.</li>
<li>The amount charged as an FEL is usually negotiable between agent and client.</li>
<li>The investor who pays an FEL pays no further sales fee if they redeem units during the term of the contract.<ul>
<li>For example, Jose has $10,000 to deposit to a segregated fund contract with a FEL of 5% ( $500). The contract value therefore begins at $9,500 ( $10,000 – $500). The maturity and death benefit guarantees are based on the $10,000.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2322-deferred-sales-charge-dsc">2.3.2.2 Deferred sales charge (DSC)<a class="headerlink" href="#2322-deferred-sales-charge-dsc" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The DSC ais applied to a full or partial withdrawal made from a segregated fund during a set period of time.</li>
<li>The charge is a percentage applied against the amount withdrawn. It declines over a number of years until it is eliminated. Each insurer has a schedule that lists the amount charged each year and the number of years the charge is applied. The schedule informs investors of what to expect as a sales charge if they proceed with a withdrawal or surrender.</li>
<li>The DSC encourages investors to keep their investment and not to surrender the contract while the sales charge is in place.

<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Josephine deposits $10,000 to her segregated fund contract with a DSC. Two years later she needs some of the money. She withdraws $5,000. The sales charge applicable is 4%. Therefore, she pays $200 ( $5,000 × 4%) as the DSC.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="2323-no-sales-charge">2.3.2.3 No sales charge<a class="headerlink" href="#2323-no-sales-charge" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Segregated funds that do not have a sales charge are called “no-load funds.” They may compensate for the absence of a sales charge by charging a higher management expense fee.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="233-management-expense">2.3.3 Management expense<a class="headerlink" href="#233-management-expense" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The management expense is the combination of the management fee for a fund, its operating expenses and taxes.</li>
<li>These expenses are added together and expressed as an annual percentage of the total value of the fund known as the management expense ratio (MER).</li>
<li>
<p>The management fee compensates the fund company for the cost of investment management by a portfolio manager, trailing commissions and fund oversight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax is charged as the provincial HST rate that applies where the investor lives, and is charged on management fees and administration fees.</p>
</li>
<li>The MER of segregated funds is typically higher than the MER for an equivalent mutual fund.<ul>
<li>A segregated fund must maintain a reserve to uphold segregated fund maturity and death benefit guarantees. This is sometimes called the “insurance charge.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MERs are charged whether the market value of the fund increases or loses ground. They reduce investor returns. Fund performance is reported after the MER has reduced the return.</li>
<li>For example, if the value of units rises by 5% in a year and the MER is a 3% charge, the investment has actually only gained 2% (5% – 3%) which will be reported to the investor. If the unit value falls by 5% in a year and the MER is a 3% charge, the value of the investment will actually have decreased by 8% (-5% – 3% = -8%) which the investor will be apprised of.</li>
<li>Higher MERs are associated with funds requiring more active management and decision-making.</li>
<li>Low MERs are charged by funds such as index funds that require less active management and decision-making since the manager simply follows the index itself.</li>
<li>The MER of a fund can be changed at any time by the insurer. Investors must be notified of the change.</li>
<li>The effect of MER on returns is often underestimated by fund investors. It is essential they know what an MER increase will mean for future returns in dollars-and-cents, and not just on a percentage basis. This is good practice for agents and satisfies a requirement for disclosure.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="234-penalties">2.3.4 Penalties<a class="headerlink" href="#234-penalties" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Withdrawals and surrender of the contract may be penalized by the insurer. Such penalties are applied against the value of the contract and reduce the sum received by the investor.</li>
<li>The policy of each insurer states their charges for withdrawals and surrender.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="235-age-restrictions">2.3.5 Age restrictions<a class="headerlink" href="#235-age-restrictions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>There are age restrictions for both the last age to establish a segregated fund contract and the last age at which a deposit can be made.<ul>
<li>RRSP: the oldest age at which a contract can be begin as an RRSP is 71 (deposits can be made until December 31 of the year in which the contract owner turns 71), then the RRSP is converted to a RRIF;</li>
<li>RRIF: restricts the last age for authorized transfer, for instance from a roll-over of a spouse’s RRIF, at 90;</li>
<li>Segregated funds held in non-registered accounts and tax-free savings accounts (TFSAs): restrict the maximum issue age limit for deposits to 90.</li>

<h2 id="24-segregated-fund-taxation">2.4 Segregated Fund Taxation<a class="headerlink" href="#24-segregated-fund-taxation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The taxation of segregated funds is very complex. The following details are an overview.</li>
<li>An investor should always seek tax expertise from a tax professional regarding taxation of a segregated fund account. Agents shuould seek tax expertise from their in-house professionals or recommend the investor seek independent tax assistance.</li>
<li>Taxation of a segregated fund is based on two fundamentals:<ul>
<li>Whether the account is non-registered or registered;</li>
<li>The form of investment income earned in the fund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="241-tax-on-deposits">2.4.1 Tax on deposits<a class="headerlink" href="#241-tax-on-deposits" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Deposits or premiums paid into a non-registered account or a TFSA for a segregated fund purchase are not tax-deductible.</li>
<li>Deposits or premiums are tax-deductible when paid into a registered account, except when the account is a registered education savings plan (RESP) or registered disability savings plan (RDSP).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="242-tax-on-allocations">2.4.2 Tax on allocations<a class="headerlink" href="#242-tax-on-allocations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Investment income can be earned in both non-registered and registered accounts as:<ul>
<li>Interest;</li>
<li>Dividends;</li>
<li>Capital gains or losses;</li>
<li>Foreign income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In a non-registered account, these forms of investment income are passed from the fund through to the investor. This is the allocation, as was explained earlier in this chapter. The investor receives a tax slip from the insurer and reports the income on his annual tax return. The investor also reports the capital gain or loss on the switch of units and certain other events that occur within the fund.</li>
<li>In a registered account, these forms of investment income are allocated to the investor, but they are not reported for annual tax purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="243-tax-on-withdrawals">2.4.3 Tax on withdrawals<a class="headerlink" href="#243-tax-on-withdrawals" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>When units of a non-registered account are redeemed for a withdrawal, a capital gain or loss will be incurred. This must be reported on the investor’s annual tax return. The amount of gain or loss is based on the adjusted cost base (ACB) of the units and their market value when they are redeemed.</li>
<li>When a withdrawal is made from an RRSP or a RRIF, the institution holding the account retains a portion of the withdrawal as an advance against future tax owing. This is called a withholding tax. Even though the investor does not receive 100% of his withdrawal due to the withholding tax, the full amount of the withdrawal must be declared for tax purposes. A reconciliation is made on the investor’s annual tax return that takes into account the tax already paid with the tax owing. Tax is applied at the same rate as interest income.</li>
<li>The TFSA is an exception in that no tax is declared or paid when a withdrawal is made.</li>
<li>When an RRSP matures (at the end of the year in which the account owner turns 71), the account holding the segregated fund can be rolled into a RRIF account.</li>
<li>RRIF accounts require a minimum annual withdrawal. The first payment must be received no later than the year after the account was set up. Although tax is typically withheld on withdrawals by the financial institution holding the account. Only withdrawals in excess of the minimum are subject to withholding tax.<ul>
<li>The annual minimum RRIF withdrawal should not be charged the withholding tax.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="244-tax-on-maturity-guarantee-and-death-benefit-guarantee">2.4.4 Tax on maturity guarantee and death benefit guarantee<a class="headerlink" href="#244-tax-on-maturity-guarantee-and-death-benefit-guarantee" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Tax on the guarantees applies to the top-up sum contributed by the insurer if the market value of the units is less than their guarantees.</li>
<li>When the segregated fund is held in a non-registered account, any amount paid as a maturity guarantee or death benefit guarantee top-up is taxable as a capital gain. When the fund is in a registered account, top-ups are taxable as income.</li>
<li>A surviving spouse named as the beneficiary of a registered account can defer tax on the top-up if he rolls the proceeds into his RRSP or RRIF.</li>
<li>Top-ups for guarantees required for TFSAs are not taxable. It is essential to check with a tax expert about taxation of top-ups.</li>
