<ul>
<li>Annuities are an investment product that takes the form of a contract which specifies terms of payment.</li>
<li>Life insurance companies issue all forms of annuities. Banks and other financial institutions may only issue one form of annuity, known as a term annuity or “term certain” annuity.</li>
<li>Annuities are usually structured to pay a regular income to the person named as the annuitant in the contract, and this is typically their most important feature.</li>
<li>The factors that influence how much the annuity pays to the annuitant are the quoted annuity rate, and guarantees on the annuity payment, if any.</li>
<li>Annuities that pay an income are called “payout annuities.” They are differentiated by whether the payout begins immediately (immediate annuities) or at a future date (deferred annuities).</li>
<li>Payout annuities are purchased by the payment of a premium or deposit to the annuity contract by the contract’s owner.</li>
<li>The contract owner chooses a schedule for payments (also called the “annuity benefit”) and the duration for payments, either for life (a life annuity) or a period of time (a term annuity).</li>
<li>Once annuity payments begin, they generally cannot be stopped before the end of the payment period.</li>
<li>Most payout annuities are issued with a set, or level, payment unless the annuity is either an indexed annuity or a variable annuity.</li>
<li>In addition to payout annuities, Canadians can also buy accumulation annuities. An accumulation annuity does not pay income, but provides a way to accumulate funds in the form of savings with a maturity date. At maturity, the savings in the annuity may be converted into a payout annuity or surrendered (paid to the owner) without penalty.</li>
<li>Accumulation annuities provide investment security because 100% of the invested capital is returned to the investor.</li>
<li>In addition to the security they provide, annuities are easily understood, provide income security, creditor protection, and estate planning benefits and protection for the annuitant in the form of insurance against the issuer’s insolvency or bankruptcy through Assuris.</li>

<li>An individual wants to receive a regular payment from a lump sum of capital to invest. He wants to invest his capital without risk of loss, and, typically, looks to the annuity payments as a source of regular income, since his investment is repaid to him over time.</li>
<li>The investor decides who is going to receive the payment from the contract. This person is called the annuitant.</li>
<li>The insurer pays the annuitant on a regular schedule, that has been selected by the contract owner. Each payment is comprised of a portion of the invested capital plus interest.</li>
<li>The starting point for payments to the annuitant to begin depends on whether the annuity is immediate or deferred. Once started, payments continue for life or the term of the contract:<ul>
<li>Life annuity: ends on death of the annuitant;</li>
<li>Term annuity: ends on its maturity date.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An accumulation annuity “breaks the annuity mold” because it does not pay an income. It is a form of term savings with a maturity date. At maturity, it may be converted into a payout annuity or surrendered without penalty and its proceeds received by the investor in a lump sum.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="312-income-security">3.1.2 Income security<a class="headerlink" href="#312-income-security" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>All annuitants have the security of knowing when to expect their annuity payment based on the schedule selected in the annuity contract.</li>
<li>Annuities with a level, or set, payment provide income security because the annuitant also knows in advance how much each payment will be:<ul>
<li>The payments are guaranteed by the issuer;</li>
<li>This knowledge allows annuitants to plan their finances and spending. This is one reason why many investors choose annuities for retirement income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Level payments are also a way the owner can control the amount of income to be paid to an annuitant when the annuitant is unable to manage his or her personal finances on their own.<ul>
<li>For instance, a parent could establish an annuity for a mentally challenged child with the assurance that the child would receive a regular payment of a known sum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The income security provided by an annuity may last for the lifetime of the annuitant, the lifetime of a spouse, or temporarily over a defined period of time.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3121-lifetime-income">3.1.2.1 Lifetime income<a class="headerlink" href="#3121-lifetime-income" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>When payments are paid for the lifetime of the annuitant, the annuity has been issued as a single life or “straight life” annuity.</li>
<li>Annuities can also take the form of “joint life,” in which one annuity names two annuitants, who are usually spouses. They may be joint annuitants or co-annuitants. Payments continue for the life of the surviving annuitant after the first annuitant dies.</li>
<li>A joint-life annuity can function like a pension to provide retirement income. When payments are provided with a lifetime guarantee, the annuitant (and their spouse, if a joint life annuity is selected) do not have to worry about outliving their money, even if they live for a very long time.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3122-spousal-income">3.1.2.2 Spousal income<a class="headerlink" href="#3122-spousal-income" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>An annuity can be used to provide income for a spouse using a:<ul>
<li>Single life annuity in which a spouse is named as annuitant;</li>
<li>Joint annuity in which both spouses may receive annuity income and after the death of the first spouse, the surviving spouse continues to receive the annuity payment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3123-temporary-income">3.1.2.3 Temporary income<a class="headerlink" href="#3123-temporary-income" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A term annuity provides an income to an annuitant for the term or period of time stated in the contract. The payment period may be as short as a few years, or last for decades.</li>
<li>A term annuity can be used to fill the gap between two dates, such as between the time when an employee takes an early retirement and the time a workplace pension begins. In this case, the term annuity would provide income after early retirement, and before the pension begins.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="313-creditor-protection">3.1.3 Creditor protection<a class="headerlink" href="#313-creditor-protection" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>People who are self-employed, business owners, and professionals may find the creditor protection available through an annuity of particular benefit because they are more likely to find themselves in situations in which creditors could make a claim against their assets.</li>
<li>When an annuity names specific beneficiaries, rather than the owner’s estate, the amount deposited to the annuity contract is protected against financial claims made by creditors of the contract owner.</li>
<li>The intention of the law, providing that annuity deposits cannot be accessed by creditors, is to protect the dependants of an insolvent contract owner from creditor claims. The value of the contract cannot be claimed by creditors when a spouse, child, grandchild, or parent is named as the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the annuity contract, or when an irrevocable beneficiary is named.</li>
<li>Some annuities offer unseizable benefits, such as annuities funded by a transfer of a lock-in pension, coming from a locked-in retirement account (LIRA).</li>
<li>However, if a contract owner surrenders their term annuity and receives its commuted value (as a lump sum), that lump sum does not benefit from creditor protection.</li>
<li>To benefit from creditor protection, the contract must have been purchased significantly in advance of the owner’s insolvency. This requirement ensures the owner has not purchased the annuity as an attempt to escape financial obligations to creditors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="314-estate-planning-benefits">3.1.4 Estate planning benefits<a class="headerlink" href="#314-estate-planning-benefits" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Annuities offer a valuable estate-planning feature through the ability to name a beneficiary to a contract. When annuity payments are made to a beneficiary, those payments bypass the estate and are thus not subject to probate fees (except in Quebec). The beneficiary also receives funds faster than if they were waiting for the estate to be settled.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3141-insured-life-annuity">3.1.4.1 Insured life annuity<a class="headerlink" href="#3141-insured-life-annuity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>An “insured annuity” is the name given to a strategy that uses combination of two separate insurance products: a permanent life insurance policy and a straight life annuity.</li>
<li>Its purpose is to protect estate capital.</li>
<li>The insured annuity process is:<ul>
<li>A proposed policy owner identifies the sum of money needed on death to settle their estate;</li>
<li>They acquire permanent life insurance, such as Term-100 (T-100) or whole life insurance, with a death benefit that is equal to the sum required to settle their estate;</li>
<li>If the proposed policy owner does not qualify for life insurance, the insured annuity cannot be implemented, and the process must stop at this point.</li>
<li>After the insurance policy is issued, the life insured buys a life annuity with a deposit that is sufficient to ensure that the annuity payments will, at a minimum, cover the life insurance premiums as they come due;</li>
<li>Upon the death of the life insured (who is also the annuitant), the life annuity contract and payments end, and the life insurance death benefit is paid to beneficiaries and/or the estate. Beneficiaries do not receive the capital of the estate through the will, but because the insured annuity “matches” the needs of the estate to the life insurance death benefit, they will receive an equivalent amount of capital from the life insurance policy death benefit, tax-free.</li>
</ul>

<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Stephen, aged 60, wants to leave his two nieces a legacy of $250,000 each on his death. If he puts aside the $500,000 now, he no longer can spend that money. Instead, Stephen purchases a Term-100 life insurance policy with a $500,000 death benefit. He names his nieces as beneficiaries of the policy. Premiums for the policy are $1,000/month. Stephen then acquires a single life annuity using $200,000 of his savings. He receives about $1,000/month in an annuity payment. He uses the money to pay his life insurance premium. He has effectively “bought” an inheritance of $500,000 for the sum of $200,000. He still has access to $300,000 of his savings to use for other purposes, such as retirement.</p>

<ul>
<li>If an insurer that has issued annuities is no longer able to meet its payment commitments, the policies are then transferred to another insurer that is willing and able to assume those payments.</li>
<li>The transfer process is facilitated by Assuris, who also guarantees future payments up to specified limits.</li>
<li>An annuitant receives Assuris protection on a payout annuity on the payment in full when it is up to $2,000 per month. For example, if a promised benefit is a level $1,000 per month, the annuitant will continue to receive $1,000 per month after the policy has been transferred to a new insurer.</li>
<li>When a benefit for a payout annuity is more than $2,000 per month, the annuitant receives Assuris protection for the greater of $2,000 per month or 85% of the promised benefit. For example, if a promised benefit is $5,000 per month, the annuitant would receive $4,250 ( $5,000 × 85%).</li>
<li>For accumulation annuities, Assuris protects up to 100% of the contract value, to a maximum of $100,000. Therefore, if an accumulation annuity value is less than $100,000, the policy owner receives all of their deposit value. If the annuity value is greater than $100,000, they receive $100,000.</li>

<ul>
<li>As mentioned earlier in this module, the two core forms of annuities are the payout annuity and the accumulation annuity.</li>
<li>The purpose of each type of annuity is very different, so it is important for agents to understand which type best suits which circumstances.</li>

<ul>
<li>The purpose of a payout annuity is, as its name suggests, “paying out” income.</li>
<li>The income stream received from a payout annuity is a blend of interest and principal created from the deposit of capital to the contract. The payment amount is based on the annuity rate applied at the time the contract is issued.</li>
<li>Payout annuities are available as immediate and deferred annuities with term, straight life, or joint life annuity payments.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3212-accumulation-annuity">3.2.1.2 Accumulation annuity<a class="headerlink" href="#3212-accumulation-annuity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>An accumulation annuity is a form of term savings with a built-in maturity date.</li>
<li>Accumulation annuities do not provide an income stream. Instead, their purpose is investment growth.</li>
<li>Accumulation annuities are similar to a Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) but come with the features of a life insurance contract, such as the ability to name a beneficiary and creditor protection.</li>
<li>The accumulation annuity credits interest of deposits on a daily, monthly, or compound basis. Daily interest is not a guaranteed sum. In certain cases, interest may be guaranteed over a number of years, such as one year, five years or ten years, because the annuity deposit is used to buy a fixed-term investment at a guaranteed interest rate.</li>
<li>Interest applied to deposits increase the accumulated value of the annuity.</li>
<li>Once the annuity has matured, it may be surrendered for its accumulated value or it may be converted into a payout annuity, which will pay a fixed amount based on the accumulated value and the annuity rate in force at the time of maturity.</li>

<li>A contract may be issued to a person naming him or another person as the annuitant. If a person uses funds in his RRSP or RRIF to buy an annuity, he must be named the annuitant.</li>
<li>The annuitant receives the income from the annuity contract for a specific period or life, depending on whether the annuity is a term-certain annuity or a lifetime payout annuity.</li>

<ul>
<li>A joint-life contract, also known as a “joint and last survivor annuity,” pays an income over the lifespan of two people, usually spouses. The two individuals named in the annuity are known as co-annuitants.</li>
<li>Payments may be issued to both annuitants or one annuitant. When the first annuitant dies, payments continue to the co-annuitant, typically the surviving spouse.</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="3231-term">3.2.3.1 Term<a class="headerlink" href="#3231-term" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A term annuity is issued to pay income to a specified age, such as to age 71, or for a specific length of time, such as 10 years:<ul>
<li>All other factors being equal, the longer the term, the less received in each annuity payment. This is because the income from the deposits must be stretched over a longer period of time;</li>
<li>For example, Donald, aged 65, deposits $100,000 to a five-year term annuity. He receives approximately $1,700 per month in his annuity payment. If the annuity were a 10-year term, he would receive about $900 per month.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a term annuity ends, all payments cease because the annuitant has received the entire principal deposited to the contract, along with the interest earned on that principal.</li>
<li>If death of the annuitant occurs during the term of the annuity, the balance of annuity payments is paid to a beneficiary as either:<ul>
<li>Monthly payments for the period remaining in the term where the value is paid in instalments to the beneficiary and is sometimes called the instalment refund choice;</li>
<li>A lump sum payment that represents the present value of all future payments paid as a cash refund. This is also known as the commuted value of the annuity or the cash refund choice; or</li>
<li>The amount that remains of the original deposit. For example, if the contract was funded with $100,000 and $75,000 had been paid out, the beneficiary would receive $25,000 ( $100,000 — $75,000). This is known as a capital protection guarantee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Term Annuity-to-age-90 (T-90) is an annuity option available to those whose registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) is maturing, and the RRSP account must be closed. Using some or all of the value in the RRSP to buy a term annuity continues tax deferral on the money.</li>
<li>Additionally, a Term Annuity-to-age-18 (T-18) is available for financially dependent children who are younger than 18 who receive the proceeds from the RRSP/RRIF of a deceased parent or grandparent.<ul>
<li>The lump sum in the registered account is transferred to an annuity for the child tax-free.</li>
<li>The child receives payments from the annuity until, at the latest, the day before he or she turns 19.</li>
<li>Tax on the payments as they are paid is paid by the child at his or her marginal tax rate.</li>

<ul>
<li>An impaired annuity is a form of life annuity.</li>
<li>An impaired annuity is issued when the annuitant has a shortened life expectancy due to poor health because of a serious disease or deteriorating condition. An impaired annuity can be bought for a single life annuitant or joint life annuitants when both spouses suffer from medical conditions that lead to shortened life expectancy.</li>
<li>Impaired life annuities are also called “enhanced,” “age-rated,” or “accelerated annuities.”</li>
<li>The amount of payment received by the annuitant is based on underwriting of their medical condition. The annuitant must provide a medical certificate proving substandard health.</li>
<li>Once an impairment is proven, the annuitant either pays a lower premium, or receives a higher payment than someone who does not have a health condition because payments are expected to be issued over a shorter period corresponding to the shortened lifespan.</li>

<ul>
<li>A lump-sum deposit is made when funds are transferred from a registered or non-registered account to the annuity. The deposit occurs just once by transfer from non-registered investor savings and investments or from a registered account.</li>
<li>Agents must be alert to indicators that a lump-sum deposit is an effort by the purchaser to launder money or finance terrorist activity. They should read and bear in mind the guidance from FINTRAC (Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada) specific to life insurance and annuity providers.</li>

<ul>
<li>Transferring funds from a registered account (such as an RRSP or RRIF) continues the tax deferral on the amount that is transferred to a registered annuity contract. Therefore, there is no immediate tax consequence for a transfer.</li>
<li>
<p>When registered savings are the source of funding of the annuity, the policy owner and annuitant must be the same person. They can choose a life of T-90 annuity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locked-in pension savings accumulated in an employer-provided or group pension plan. can be transferred only to a life annuity, including funds in a LIRA, LIF, or a PRIF.</p>
</li>
<li>When a spouse transfers locked-in savings from a registered pension plan, LIRA, or LIF to fund an annuity, they must usually acquire a joint and last survivor life annuity. This ensures that if the pensioner dies before his spouse, the surviving spouse will continue to receive an income. That spouse can waive the right to the annuity in writing.</li>

<h3 id="342-deferred-income">3.4.2 Deferred income<a class="headerlink" href="#342-deferred-income" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A policy owner who selects their payments to begin at a future date has a deferred annuity. There are two phases to the deferred annuity:<ul>
<li>During the accumulation phase, the annuitant either deposits a lump sum to the contract or pays regular premiums. Deposits held by the insurer earn investment income.</li>
<li>The income (or payout) phase begins at the end of the deferral period, for instance, ten years after the first deposit. A maximum length of time permitted for the deferral will be stated in the contract.</li>

<ul>
<li>In contrast to annuities with level payments, indexed income provides payments that increase over the payment period to keep in step with inflation, thus maintaining the purchasing power of the annuity payments.</li>
<li>Indexing an annuity increases payments annually by a percentage selected by the policy owner. Therefore, income increases year over year to keep pace with rising costs.</li>
<li>The maximum amount of yearly increase is capped, for instance at 4%.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="345-variable-income">3.4.5 Variable income<a class="headerlink" href="#345-variable-income" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A variable income annuity is an immediate life annuity which also allows the annuitant to earn investment returns that are linked to market performance. A market-linked return is a return linked to performance of a market index, such as the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index.</li>
<li>The annuitant who has a variable income annuity is paid on the basis of annuity units.</li>
<li>The annuitant receives a set number of units at the time the deposit is made.</li>
<li>The contract owner chooses the investment mix on which unit is based, and also selects a rate of return that must be attained before increase.<ul>
<li>If the value of the units increases above the chosen rate of return, the annuitant’s income increases as the payments increase in accordance with the rate of return.</li>
<li>If the value of the units declines, the annuitant’s income will fall as the payments decrease.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The variable income annuity mitigates interest risk and inflation risk since returns are intended to increase with the market. However, since the contract owner will face equity risk, he must have the required level of risk tolerance that matches equity investing.</li>

<h3 id="351-annuity-rate">3.5.1 Annuity rate<a class="headerlink" href="#351-annuity-rate" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The annuity rate is a dollar figure quoted to future policy owners that they will receive as their annuity payment. It is based on the current interest rate and other factors that are specific to the annuitant and to how the annuity contract is structured.</li>
<li>In effect, the annuity rate represents the return on the sum invested in the annuity.<ul>
<li>For example, Bernadette purchases an annuity contract with an annuity rate of $6,000 per $100,000. If she deposits $300,000 in the annuity, she will receive payments of $18,000 (( $300,000 ÷ $100,000) × $6,000) annually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The annuity rate also takes into consideration costs that are applied against the contract, such as commission and insurer expenses.</li>
<li>Rates differ between issuers since they do not all use the same interest rate or calculation of cost factors.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3511-interest-rate">3.5.1.1 Interest rate<a class="headerlink" href="#3511-interest-rate" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The interest rate in effect at the time the contract is issued is a major factor in determining the payment to the annuitant.</li>
<li>The interest rate assigned to the annuity never changes over its duration (that is, if interest rates change during the term of the annuity, the annuity payment does not change in response). It is based on the prevailing interest rate offered in other forms of interest-bearing investments at the time the contract is issued.</li>
<li>The annuitant does not benefit from a higher payment if interest rates rise over the duration of the contract. This is the reason annuities have interest rate risk.</li>

<li>He purchases a 10-year term annuity. Assuming it is paid to maturity, it will yield 120 monthly payments (10 years × 12 months). Based only on 10 years of payments, Rosario could receive a monthly payment of $833 ( $100,000 ÷ 120).</li>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong> 2</li>
<li>He purchases an immediate life annuity. The insurer’s mortality tables indicate his expected lifespan is 24 years.

<li>Guarantees increase the cost of the annuity for the policy owner, decreasing the amount the annuitant receives.</li>
<li>However, guarantees reduce the risk that the initial deposit will not be paid out in part or fully, and therefore, protects the invested capital.</li>
<li>Term annuities do not require guarantees since, one way or another, the principal is paid out. In a joint and last survivor and life annuity, a guarantee is an option chosen by the policy owner.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A term annuity is guaranteed for its entire term. If the contract owner dies during the term, a beneficiary receives the difference between the sum invested and the amount paid to the annuitant. The three options available for a beneficiary are discussed in Section 3.2.3.1.</li>
<li>A life annuity can be issued with or without a guarantee.</li>
<li>The guarantee applies to a period of time stated as a number of years, such as 5, 10, or 20 years. This length of time referred to as the guarantee period.</li>
<li>The guarantee ensures that if the annuitant dies before the end of the guarantee period, the beneficiary receives a payment from the contract.</li>
<li>The amount the beneficiary receives represents the difference between the number of payments provided for the guarantee period and the number of payments the annuitant received:<ul>
<li>For example, Annette purchases a life annuity that is paid monthly with a 10-year guarantee period. She names her twin sister, Ava, as the beneficiary of the contract;</li>
<li>The guarantee ensures that the annuity will issue a minimum of 120 payments (12 monthly payments per year × 10 years). If Annette dies after receiving 100 payments, her sister Ava will receive the equivalent of 20 payments (120 – 100).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The amount the beneficiary receives may be paid as:<ul>
<li>A lump sum, corresponding to the current value of future guaranteed payments; or</li>
<li>Instalment payments for the remainder of the guaranteed period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This guarantee brings peace of mind to the policy owner because he knows that a sum of money from the annuity is guaranteed to be paid out - first to the annuitant himself and, if he dies, to the beneficiary.</li>
<li>The guarantee period option does not apply to the total amount invested in the contract; rather It safeguards some of the investment. The type of guarantee that protects the total initial investment is called a capital protection guarantee.</li>
<li>Available in life annuities, the capital protection guarantee returns a sum to the beneficiary equal to the difference between payments received before the death of the annuitant and the initial capital:<ul>
<li>The annuity is called a “cash refund annuity” if the beneficiary receives a lump sum;</li>
<li>If the amount is paid in instalments, the annuity is called an “instalment refund annuity.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A life annuity without a guarantee is a risky investment. The annuitant of a single life contract could die after receiving his first monthly payment. If no guarantee was in place, no payment would be made to a beneficiary. The balance of the sum invested with the insurer would then belong to the insurer.</li>
<li>However, a life annuity without a guarantee also pays at a higher rate than when guarantees are added. The contract owner or annuitant(s) must weigh the higher return against the higher risk to decide which form of annuity is most suitable.</li>

<ul>
<li>When a joint and last survivor annuity is chosen, survivor income is guaranteed for two lives.</li>
<li>A guarantee period can also be added to the contract to provide the assurance that a certain amount will be paid out from the amount invested.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Tony and Jane buy a $100,000 joint-and-last-survivor life annuity with a 10-year guarantee. Tony and Jane are co-annuitants. Jane is set to receive the full amount of the benefit upon Tony’s death. Tony and Jane’s son, Roger, is the beneficiary. Tony receives $300 per month as his annuity payment. Jane does not receive a payment. When Tony dies two years after receiving his first payment, payments are then issued to Jane. Jane receives $300 per month until she dies three years later. Payments were made to Tony and Jane for a total of five years. Roger receives a sum equivalent to 5 years’ payments because the contract has a 10-year guarantee, i.e., $18,000:</p>
<ul>
<li>( $300 × 12 months × 5 years). He chooses to receive the amount as a lump sum.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Because annuity payments to a surviving annuitant extend the period of payment, joint annuities generate lower payments than a single life annuity, all other factors being equal.</li>
<li>As an alternative to a joint and last survivor annuity, a spouse who is named as a beneficiary in a single life annuity contract with a guaranteed payment could receive income in the form of instalment payments.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="361-risks">3.6.1 Risks<a class="headerlink" href="#361-risks" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Annuities are insulated from many typical investment risks for the contract owner and annuitant when they are not issued in the variable income form. Once the contract is finalized, the investor knows how much to expect, through the promised annuity rate, and when, due to the timing and schedule selected in the application. No further decisions are required. The annuity is set with its Canadian issuer and for the most part, unchangeable. While being an advantage, this exposes the annuitant to interest rate and inflation risks. It also hampers flexibility to acquire funds for unforeseen expenses.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3611-interest-rate-risk">3.6.1.1 Interest rate risk<a class="headerlink" href="#3611-interest-rate-risk" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Interest-rate risk is often associated with annuities, especially when interest rates are low at the time the contract is drawn up. If the policy owner commits to a low interest rate, that commitment cannot be changed. Instead, if rates rise, the annuity payment continues at the original rate.</li>
<li>Interest-rate risk can be managed during a period of low interest rates by using investment capital to buy a series of annuities acquired over a number of years instead of buying a single annuity. If interest rates rise, the policy owner will benefit from the increased rates with higher payments.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3612-inflation-risk">3.6.1.2 Inflation risk<a class="headerlink" href="#3612-inflation-risk" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inflation risk goes hand-in-hand with interest rate risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflation risk can be managed by acquiring an indexed annuity, even though the cost of the annuity is much higher than an annuity that is not indexed. This means that less is initially received in the annuity payment because the principal must be retained to increase payments in the future.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="362-loss-of-capital">3.6.2 Loss of capital<a class="headerlink" href="#362-loss-of-capital" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A life annuity contract without a guarantee period risks the loss of capital—if the annuitant dies, the contract ends. If death occurred just after payments began, most capital deposited to the contract would be retained by the insurance company.</li>
<li>This risk is managed by adding a guarantee period and beneficiary to the contract.</li>
<li>Adding a guarantee period increases the cost of the annuity. Payments to the annuitant are less when a guarantee period exists.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Nicholas, a widower with two grown children, receives an inheritance from his aunt in the amount of $450,000. He uses the money to buy an immediate single life annuity, but he does not elect to include a guarantee period. Therefore, a beneficiary is not named.</p>
<p>One year after annuity payments start, Nicholas dies. Neither his children nor his estate can benefit from the remaining value of the annuity. If Nicholas had opted for a guarantee period that named his children as beneficiaries, they would have received the value of the guarantee.</p>

<li>Payout annuities do not permit withdrawals.</li>
<li>When a market withdrawal is made from an accumulation annuity:<ul>
<li>A market value adjustment (MVA) is a penalty calculated by the insurer that has issued the contract. The agent must inform the contract owner that a withdrawal may be reduced by the MVA.</li>
<li>The MVA is based on interest rates, expenses, and the amount of time remaining until the maturity date of the investment.</li>
<li>The interest rate factor looks at the guaranteed interest rate and the interest rate in effect at the time of withdrawal. Expenses are the costs incurred by the insurer.</li>

<p>Peter wishes to invest in an annuity to receive payments five years from now. Depending on the type of annuity purchased, payments will be taxed on an accrual or prescribed basis.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong> 1 – Accrual annuity</li>
<li>Peter buys a deferred life annuity. He is the annuitant of the contract. His first monthly payment is to be paid in five years. The annuity does not meet the conditions to be prescribed because it is deferred beyond December 31<sup>st</sup> of that year. He is taxed on investment growth annually during the five years of deferral. Each of his payments is $800 when they begin, and is comprised of $100 in capital and $700 in interest. Therefore, of the $9,600 he receives for the year ( $800 × 12), he pays tax on $8,400 ( $700 × 12). After five years, each $800 payment is $400 in capital and $400 in interest. After ten years, the payment is $700 in capital and $100 in interest.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong> 2 – Prescribed annuity</li>
<li>Peter acquires an accumulation annuity contract. He is taxed on investment growth annually. Five years later, Peter decides to use the savings in his contract to transfer into an immediate life annuity in which he is the annuitant. Payments of $800 are to begin immediately. Since the life annuity meets all the necessary conditions, it is prescribed. The amount of tax he pays is level (i.e., it is equal throughout the payment period because each payment will be comprised of the same portion of capital and interest). If payments are comprised of $440 of capital and $360 of interest, on the $9,600 he will receive annually ( $800 × 12), he will pay taxes on $4,320 ( $360 × 12) for the duration of the payment period.</li>

Their primary objective is unlike that of other annuities in that they are intended to provide Canadians with greater flexibility in managing their retirement savings.</li>

<li>An advanced deferred life annuity (ALDA) is a life annuity available to individuals who have an RRSP or a RRIF or who participate in a deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP), a pooled registered pension plan (PRPP) or a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP). More on these accounts and plans is provided later in this manual.</li>
<li>Key to this form of annuity is the ability to defer payments until the end of the year in which the annuitant reaches 85. Therefore, the ALDA addresses longevity risk and ensures that investors do not deplete their savings prematurely during retirement.</li>
<li>The funds deposited to an ALDA are no longer controlled by the account owner. This lessens the need for decisions about investments at a time of life when people may lose their ability to make complex financial choices.</li>
<li>Payments are periodic, as with other annuities. The ALDA cannot be commuted or surrendered, or provide a guarantee.</li>
<li>A lifetime limit of 25% of the value of the qualifying plan, to a total of $150,000 applies to ALDA purchases and will be indexed to inflation. Income received will not be included in calculating the minimum annual amount withdrawal from a RRIF, a PRPP account or a defined contribution account, after the year in which the ALDA is purchased.</li>
