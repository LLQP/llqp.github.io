<ul>
<li>What is the purpose of developing an investor profile?<ul>
<li>The investor profile is a collection of data about the client’s financial situation and personal factors;</li>
<li>The data is analyzed so the agent can better understand the client’s motivations and preferences—and what might influence his investment decisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To create the investor profile, the agent must review:<ul>
<li>The assets and liabilities of the client to determine his overall financial situation;</li>
<li>Personal factors that may affect the client’s investment decisions;</li>
<li>Client needs and objectives;</li>
<li>Sources of income during retirement;</li>
<li>Programs and savings plans that can help the client to save and meet his needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="41-financial-situation-of-the-investor">4.1 Financial Situation of the Investor<a class="headerlink" href="#41-financial-situation-of-the-investor" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Information about assets and liabilities is first gathered so the client’s financial position may be evaluated through a net worth statement and a cash flow statement:<ul>
<li>The net worth statement lists assets and subtracts liabilities. It is a snapshot of the investor’s financial situation and its result shows whether the investor has a positive net worth (good) or a negative net worth (bad);</li>
<li>The cash flow statement lists income (inflow) and expenses (outflow). The bottom line reveals whether the investor earned more than he spent. A positive cash flow indicates that money is available for spending, saving and investing. A negative cash flow means that more is being spent than being earned; an unsustainable financial position.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="411-review-of-assets">4.1.1 Review of assets<a class="headerlink" href="#411-review-of-assets" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Assets are anything a person owns with cash value.</li>
<li>The single most valuable asset most people own is their home thanks to the equity that builds over time as a result of the difference between the market value of the home and its decreasing mortgage.</li>
<li>Personal assets also include other types of real estate, registered and non-registered investments, pension plan savings, the cash value of life insurance, fine jewelry, art and specialized equipment such as tools or cameras.</li>
<li>Assets are important for both their value and the collateral they provide for the purpose of borrowing.</li>
<li>Personal assets are listed to see the “plus” side of the net worth statement (also called a balance sheet). Their value shows the complete value of personal assets as well as progress made in building worth.</li>
<li>The following are some of the documents that provide information about an investor’s personal assets.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4111-income-tax-return">4.1.1.1 Income tax return<a class="headerlink" href="#4111-income-tax-return" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Income is reported on the annual income tax return.<ul>
<li>Corporations file separate returns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the income tax return is filed, the Notice of Assessment (NOA) is issued by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).<ul>
<li>Taxpayers in Québec receive a NOA from Revenu Québec.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The key information shown in the personal income tax return is:<ul>
<li>Amount of taxable income;</li>
<li>How that income is earned;</li>
<li>Use of tax credits and deductions, including RRSP contributions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The NOA summarizes:<ul>
<li>Total income;</li>
<li>Amount of tax paid;</li>
<li>Amount of tax owed;</li>
<li>Tax credits received;</li>
<li>Deduction room available for an RRSP;</li>
<li>Unused net capital losses;</li>
<li>Tax-free savings account (TFSA) contributions, withdrawals, and unused contribution room;</li>
<li>Other necessary repayments, carry-forwards, and rebate information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Income can be earned from multiple sources in addition to employment.<ul>
<li>For example, from a personal business, retirement pensions, investments, or spousal support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dependability of the income is essential to planning. For example, business income could vary year-to-year, but income from a Canada Pension Plan (CPP)/Québec Pension Plan (QPP) retirement pension would be stable. From this information, the investor and agent know what can be counted on for income in future years.</li>
<li>Contributions made to registered savings plans demonstrate the investor’s current dedication to savings.</li>
<li>The deduction limit for RRSPs is calculated based on earned income. It shows whether contributions are currently maximized and is a basis for planning future savings.</li>
<li>Tax credits and other deductions reduce income tax:<ul>
<li>Charitable giving is reflected in the charitable donation credit;</li>
<li>The pension income tax credit can demonstrate whether a strategy for splitting retirement income could be implemented since the tax credit must be claimed before income splitting can occur.</li>
<li>The taxpayer generally pays tax at his marginal tax rate (MTR), which combines federal and provincial tax rates. The MTR is the rate of income tax applied to the next dollar of income earned.</li>
<li>It is important to consider the MTR when choosing investments and planning on using investment income due to its effect on the net amount available for retirement.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h4 id="4112-registered-retirement-savings-plan-rrsp-statement">4.1.1.2 Registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) statement<a class="headerlink" href="#4112-registered-retirement-savings-plan-rrsp-statement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The financial institution holding an RRSP issues regular statements; these statements show an account summary.</li>
<li>An RRSP statement can show many details including:<ul>
<li>The sum invested;</li>
<li>Growth of the sum invested;</li>
<li>How the sum is invested;</li>
<li>Whether the account holds locked-in funds; and</li>
<li>Withdrawals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is no limit to the number of RRSP accounts a person may have. Therefore, an individual may have multiple RRSP statements.</li>
<li>However, annual contributions to all accounts, including a person’s own RRSP and a spousal RRSP, are limited to the annual maximum, plus the available deduction limit, which includes the carry-forward of unused deductions from former years.</li>
<li>An over-contribution of $2,000 over and above this amount is allowed before penalties are incurred.</li>
<li>It is very important for an agent to see how the money deposited to the RRSP is invested. This could reveal:<ul>
<li>Investing expertise and knowledge;</li>
<li>The investor’s exposure to risk:</li>
<li>Portfolio diversification; and</li>
<li>Maturity dates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An account with locked-in funds restricts transfers and withdrawals. The money is locked-in because it has been transferred from a registered pension plan (RPP) or another locked-in account. Locked-in accounts will be addressed later in this chapter.</li>
<li>Withdrawals from an RRSP may demonstrate that the investor has had an exceptional expense or has a need to supplement his income. A conversion of the account to a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) or annuity may be advisable if withdrawals seem to occur on a regular basis.</li>
<li>The absence of an RRSP statement can also be revealing. It may show the investor does not understand the significance of having an RRSP or does not have funds available for saving in an RRSP.</li>
<li></li>
<li>If the RRSP has been closed because the investor has surpassed the age limit for owning an RRSP, statements from other types of registered accounts may be available.</li>
<li>An agent uses the RRSP statement to discern the value of this asset in the overall assets of the investor.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Just like an RRSP statement, a statement from a non-registered or taxable account will summarize the key aspects of this investment account.</li>
<li>Unlike an RRSP, there are no limitations imposed by the Income Tax Act on either deposits or withdrawals to the account.</li>
<li>This statement presents further detail regarding how the investor tends to invest as well as how much is available to contribute to net worth.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4114-pension-plan-statements">4.1.1.4 Pension plan statements<a class="headerlink" href="#4114-pension-plan-statements" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A pension plan statement—also called a member’s benefit statement—is issued on a yearly basis by employers who have a registered pension plan for their employees.</li>
<li>An employer’s pension can provide a dependable source of retirement income. This makes it a valuable asset.</li>
<li>The statement may include the expected value of the pension to be received at the standard age of retirement. Other information can include contributions made during the year and the expected retirement date. This information is essential to knowing how much will be paid and when.</li>
<li>Contributions made to a registered pension plan by an individual as well as calculated pension adjustments (PAs), reduce his RRSP deduction limit.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4115-bank-statements">4.1.1.5 Bank statements<a class="headerlink" href="#4115-bank-statements" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>

<li>It is essential to review bank statements to determine how much is available to contribute to total assets.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4116-life-insurance-policies">4.1.1.6 Life insurance policies<a class="headerlink" href="#4116-life-insurance-policies" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Life insurance policies with a cash value are an asset since this value can be accessed by the policy owner.</li>
<li>This includes whole life insurance and universal life insurance.</li>
<li>The cash may be received as a:<ul>
<li>Cash surrender value; or</li>
<li>Policy loan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Withdrawals may also be permitted by universal life insurance policies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4117-other-asset-sources">4.1.1.7 Other asset sources<a class="headerlink" href="#4117-other-asset-sources" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Multiple assets have worth or contribute to overall worth. For example:<ul>
<li>A business owner has asset value in his business in proportion to his share of ownership;</li>
<li>An inventor or designer may have an asset in a patent or intellectual property and receive royalty income;</li>
<li>A real estate investor may have income properties with asset value and receive rental income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The financial review should encompass all assets.</li>

<h3 id="412-review-of-liabilities">4.1.2 Review of liabilities<a class="headerlink" href="#412-review-of-liabilities" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Liabilities, unlike assets, reduce personal worth. Liabilities are debt and financial obligations that must be repaid.</li>
<li>Sometimes a distinction is made between “good” debt and “bad” debt. In both cases, the debt must be repaid by the borrower and included in the review of liabilities:<ul>
<li>Good debt is borrowing taken on to increase assets (i.e., a loan used for investment purposes or, in some cases, a mortgage);</li>
<li>Bad debt is debt that reduces income and financial resources (i.e., credit card debt).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The following documents provide information regarding the personal liabilities of an investor.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4121-mortgage-statement">4.1.2.1 Mortgage statement<a class="headerlink" href="#4121-mortgage-statement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>An individual’s mortgage is likely to be his largest liability—just like his home is his biggest asset.</li>
<li>Every year, the financial institution that holds the mortgage on the property issues a mortgage statement to the borrower. The mortgage statement largely presents:<ul>
<li>The amount owed;</li>
<li>The principal and interest charge of each mortgage payment;</li>
<li>The interest rate applied to the mortgage;</li>
<li>The mortgage term and its amortization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A mortgage statement can also show a reverse mortgage is in place.</li>
<li>A reverse mortgage is a payment of a portion of home equity to the homeowner in a lump sum or a series of payments. It is a liability that must be repaid if the owner sells the house or dies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4122-line-of-credit-statement">4.1.2.2 Line of credit statement<a class="headerlink" href="#4122-line-of-credit-statement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>An individual may receive a line of credit based on his creditworthiness and collateral.</li>
<li>A line of credit may be extended to homeowners based on their equity in their home. This is called a “Home Equity Line of Credit” (HELOC).</li>
<li>The line of credit statement shows:<ul>
<li>The amount owed;</li>
<li>The minimum monthly payment required; and</li>
<li>The interest rate charged against the amount of loan extended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4123-credit-card-statements">4.1.2.3 Credit card statements<a class="headerlink" href="#4123-credit-card-statements" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Credit card statements are issued monthly.</li>
<li>The credit card statement shows:<ul>
<li>Charges incurred during the month;</li>
<li>A separate charge for interest and cash advances;</li>
<li>Balance of the account;</li>
<li>The rate of interest charged; and</li>
<li>The minimum monthly payment.</li>

<h4 id="4131-net-worth-statement">4.1.3.1 Net worth statement<a class="headerlink" href="#4131-net-worth-statement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A net worth statement is developed by listing all assets at their market value and subtracting all liabilities. The final sum is the net worth of the individual or couple whose assets and liabilities are listed.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a>Net worth = value of all assets - value of all liabilities
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>A common goal of financial planning is to increase net worth to meet financial goals.<ul>
<li>Net worth is increased by:</li>
<li>Acquiring more assets;</li>
<li>Increasing the value of existing assets (for instance, through a home renovation); and</li>
<li>Decreasing liabilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A net worth statement is a benchmark against which goals can be fixed and future increases in worth can be measured.</li>

<h2 id="42-personal-factors-that-affect-investment">4.2 Personal Factors that Affect Investment<a class="headerlink" href="#42-personal-factors-that-affect-investment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Many personal factors and preferences motivate investing decisions. They include the following.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="421-personal-values">4.2.1 Personal values<a class="headerlink" href="#421-personal-values" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Personal values influence an individual’s investing approach as well as investment choices.<ul>
<li>For example, some people may value saving for education over saving for retirement. Others may value charitable giving over enlarging investment portfolios.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The agent must learn if the values will affect his client’s decisions to develop suitable recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="422-health-concerns">4.2.2 Health concerns<a class="headerlink" href="#422-health-concerns" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Health care costs can become significant with age and diminish the value of an estate. Therefore, health care costs introduce the risk of outliving one’s money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial planning should take into consideration the potential need for financial resources later on to pay future health care expenses. The financial plan should take these expenses into account well before the money may be needed. This ensures sufficient savings are set aside for care in later years.</p>
</li>
<li>The need to pay for care also introduces the potential need for long-term care insurance and critical illness insurance.</li>
<li>The agent should take into account his client’s mental capacity to make sound investment decisions. This is important because the client’s mental capacity can be impaired due to disability or getting older.<ul>
<li>Particularly, when the client gets older and important decisions regarding the client’s estate and retirement income must be made, the agent must potentially be prepared to guide decision-making based on the knowledge he has developed of the client. He must also be alert to signs that decisions being made are inappropriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The risk of disability should be examined along with other health concerns. This risk is best managed by ensuring that disability income insurance is in place for the income earners of the family:<ul>
<li>Disability can have a harmful and lasting effect on income and wealth accumulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other health considerations that may affect the investor profile are the need:<ul>
<li>To save to provide an income for a disabled child; and</li>
<li>To use financial resources to pay for care for aging parents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="423-legal-considerations">4.2.3 Legal considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#423-legal-considerations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The investor profile must take into account legal obligations to others that have a financial impact.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4231-family-law">4.2.3.1 Family law<a class="headerlink" href="#4231-family-law" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A person in a married or common-law relationship has a financial responsibility to his spouse, whether the same or opposite sex when they separate and divorce. Note: that Québec is an exception for common-law relationships.</li>
<li>Family law attempts to equalize the assets of both parties in these circumstances, including investment property. Consequently, both spouses have rights in regard to investments and their proceeds.</li>
<li>A parent also has financial duties to children, from both past marriage(s) and one’s current marriage. Child or spousal support must be paid and its cost factored into financial obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4232-will">4.2.3.2 Will<a class="headerlink" href="#4232-will" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Developing the investor profile calls for a review of the will to see what commitments are planned for the value of the estate.</li>
<li>Bequests in the will must be supported by the necessary financial resources or they may remain unfulfilled.</li>
<li>In general, a surviving spouse can obtain all the assets of a deceased spouse on a rollover basis, meaning that any taxes are deferred until the death of the second spouse.</li>
<li>Careful planning is required to meet bequests made in the will.</li>
<li>If investment proceeds are set out for a particular purpose, then the giftor should ensure an adequate amount of money will be available for the property’s inheritor. These cases may require investments with guarantees (i.e., segregated funds or a life annuity with a beneficiary) so the giftor is assured his wishes are carried out.</li>
<li>Life insurance is essential for fulfilling estate plans.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4233-power-of-attorney-poa-for-property">4.2.3.3 Power of attorney (POA) for property<a class="headerlink" href="#4233-power-of-attorney-poa-for-property" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The power of attorney (POA) is essentially a document that nominates a person to act on behalf of another when specified circumstances arise.</li>
<li>It often accompanies a will but is invoked when the individual who has created the POA is unable to act for himself. This often arises due to medical issues. Powers of attorney differ from province to province.</li>
<li>When developing the background knowledge for the investor profile, the agent should include whether a power of attorney has been given, to whom, and what his powers are, in order to determine in what circumstances he should be consulted.</li>
<li>A POA may be issued to address end-of-life health decisions or property issues.</li>
<li>The attorney in a POA is the individual named to assume decision making for another. It is not necessarily a lawyer although a lawyer could be named as attorney in a POA. It is often an individual known and trusted by the person making the POA (called the grantor).</li>
<li>An agent should decline being named as an attorney and must exercise caution when confronted with dealing with an attorney for property. The attorney has many powers for dealing with the individual’s property including switching and selling investments. Agents should be aware of the limitations on the attorney’s powers, including a restriction on changing life insurance beneficiaries, except in B.C. Financial exploitation by attorneys is a major problem; POA fraud is a criminal offence.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="424-personal-risks">4.2.4 Personal risks<a class="headerlink" href="#424-personal-risks" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Each investor faces personal risks that can affect plans for savings and investing such as the following.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4241-low-level-of-financial-literacy">4.2.4.1 Low level of financial literacy<a class="headerlink" href="#4241-low-level-of-financial-literacy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Financial literacy is the ability to understand the fundamental matters of personal finance. Individuals differ greatly regarding their level of financial illiteracy. The agent should never make assumptions based on what a client appears to know or ought to know.</li>
<li>Financial illiteracy (i.e., a lack of knowledge and understanding about financial products) can lead to an unnecessarily low tolerance of risk, which in turn can lead to low returns on investments or unnecessarily high risk tolerance, which leads to investment losses.</li>
<li>The agent should assess his client’s financial literacy and explain to his client any necessary information regarding investments, proposed plans, and the effect of risk tolerance.</li>
<li>Information must be properly communicated to the client, both in writing and verbally:<ul>
<li>In some cases, when the client’s language skills are limited, the agent will have to call on an interpreter to communicate with the client in the client’s language;</li>
<li>The agent should avoid the use of acronyms and jargon (i.e., use the term “marginal tax rate” opposed to “MTR”);</li>
<li>Financial institutions, insurers, and financial regulators provide educational resources that can be useful to help improve the client’s financial literacy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4242-risk-of-job-loss">4.2.4.2 Risk of job loss<a class="headerlink" href="#4242-risk-of-job-loss" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Job loss can have a harmful effect on investment and savings plans.</li>
<li>An emergency fund (i.e., savings to cover living expenses for a minimum of three months and up to six months) could help reduce the impacts of job loss.</li>
<li>If job loss occurs, the investor profile should be reviewed right away. Plans may need to be put on hold before irreversible changes are made that relied on continued employment.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4243-longevity-risk">4.2.4.3 Longevity risk<a class="headerlink" href="#4243-longevity-risk" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>People are currently living longer in Canada than ever before. Despite the increase in life expectancy for both men and women, the age of retirement currently remains at 65. Note that the retirement age is stated to gradually change, over a year period, to 67 years in 2023.</li>
<li>Therefore, this means retirement savings must last longer. Longevity risk is the risk that a person continues to live past the point in time that savings are depleted. This is called outliving your money.</li>
<li>Longevity risk can be managed by insurance, specifically, investments that provide lifelong income, such as a life annuity or a Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4244-risk-of-bankruptcy">4.2.4.4 Risk of bankruptcy<a class="headerlink" href="#4244-risk-of-bankruptcy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Bankruptcy occurs when an individual or a company is unable to meet financial obligations to creditors.</li>
<li>Risk of bankruptcy is mitigated by:<ul>
<li>Financial management; and</li>
<li>For individuals, choosing a careful selection of investments that can provide creditor protection (such as segregated funds).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4245-risk-of-leveraging">4.2.4.5 Risk of leveraging<a class="headerlink" href="#4245-risk-of-leveraging" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Leveraging is when an individual uses borrowed money to attain a financial goal.</li>
<li>Some forms of leveraging are common and are considered safe such as acquiring a mortgage to purchase a home and develop the equity in the home.</li>
<li>Some forms of leveraging are considered riskier such as using a loan to invest in non-guaranteed investments. If the investment loses value, the investor has lost principal plus he owes the amount of the loan invested.</li>
<li>Therefore, leveraging can either:<ul>
<li>Boost returns since it gives the investor a greater sum to invest; or</li>
<li>Amplify losses since the investor loses his savings plus the borrowed sum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The client’s knowledge of leveraging is essential to the investor profile since it speaks to investor goals and risk tolerance.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4246-risk-of-unforeseen-expenses">4.2.4.6 Risk of unforeseen expenses<a class="headerlink" href="#4246-risk-of-unforeseen-expenses" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Unforeseen expenses are exactly what their name suggests: expenses that arise unexpectedly and, therefore, cannot be planned for. Medical expenses are one category of expense often overlooked due to the assumption that provincial health plans cover all bills.

<ul>
<li>Income is a necessity to pay the costs of living and for saving.</li>
<li>Goals must be realistic and identified with an assigned dollar value to give meaning and purpose to savings plans.</li>
<li>If there is not enough income, or only just enough, to pay for the costs of living, then any plans for savings must wait until there is an increase in income or a decrease in costs.</li>

<ul>
<li>There are three groupings of individuals in which there will be a need to examine the income needs of an individual:<ul>
<li>Those who are unmarried and not in a common-law relationship;</li>
<li>The widowed;</li>
<li>Those who are separated or divorced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To create an accurate picture of an individual’s financial situation, individual income needs must be compared against individual expenses.</li>
<li>The shared financial situation of couples should be assessed according to the household or family income — this encompasses both income earners and household expenses.</li>
<li>For both individuals and couples, the income needs of dependants should be taken into consideration.</li>
<li>Income needs may be expressed in terms of present and future needs.</li>
<li>For instance, if an investor profile needs an increased income in the present, the agent may want to reassess the individual’s budget to detect spending behaviour.</li>
<li>The investment plan’s focus should concentrate on meeting future income needs. Such a plan is based on goals for the future.</li>

<ul>
<li>Retirement income is the money needed to meet retirement expenses. Retirement income replaces or supplements employment income when a person retires.</li>
<li>Income sources during retirement can include:<ul>
<li>Government retirement pension income;</li>
<li>Private pension income;</li>
<li>Investment income;</li>
<li>Personal savings;</li>
<li>Employment income since some choose to continue work post-retirement;</li>
<li>Business income. The business owner may not be actively working in the company but still receive a salary or dividends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An essential factor when assessing the amount of income needed during retirement is the income tax that will be due on amounts received. Therefore, spending should be based on net income (i.e., income remaining after tax).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4321-income-splitting">4.3.2.1 Income splitting<a class="headerlink" href="#4321-income-splitting" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Income splitting takes advantage of the different marginal tax rates of spouses. When spouses have the same marginal tax rate, income splitting serves no purpose.</li>
<li>Income splitting apportions income between spouses so that some income is moved to a spouse who pays tax at a lower marginal tax rate than the other.</li>
<li>Therefore, the couple saves money putting income into the hands of a spouse who pays tax at a lower rate.</li>
<li>Some examples of effective income splitting include:</li>
<li>Opening a spousal or common-law partner RRSP:<ul>
<li>The higher-income spouse makes payments to the plan for the other spouse. This works for income splitting if the spouse receiving the contributions is in a lower tax bracket than the contributing spouse when withdrawals are made. This is referred to as a spousal or common-law partner plan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Splitting pension income for those 65 and older:<ul>
<li>Up to 50% of the annual income received from a lifetime annuity, registered pension plan, RRSP annuity, registered retirement income fund (RRIF) or deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP) annuity can be allocated to a spouse. The splitting for tax (SPSP) purposes is done via the tax return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assigning Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits:<ul>
<li>CPP can be shared between spouses who were contributors, or between spouses when only one was a contributor. This is called an assignment. Québec Pension Plan (QPP) sharing is also available for couples who are married or in a civil union or living in a common-law relationship of at least three years’ duration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>David receives $18,690 per year as a pension from his former employer. His marginal tax rate is 37%. He could pay as much as $6,915.30 ( $18,690 × 37%) in income tax on his pension. David’s wife, Beth, has a marginal tax rate of 29%. David splits his pension with Beth, so they each declare $9,345 ( $18,690 ÷ 2) as income.</p>
<p>David’s income tax payable becomes $3,457.65 ( $9,345 × 37%). Beth’s income tax payable is $2,710.05 ( $9,345 × 29%). Together they pay $6,167.70 in income tax ( $3,457.65 + $2,710.05), a saving of $747.60 ( $6,915.30 – $6,167.70) compared to the tax due if David did not split his pension income.</p>

<ul>
<li>There can be an added advantage for the retiree who receives Old Age Security (OAS) pension benefits when income splitting. The OAS pension is completely forfeited by the pensioner when net income reaches a specified level and partly repaid when income exceeds a threshold level. Therefore, the amount of repayment, also called the “clawback,” is reduced when income is reduced by income splitting.</li>

<li>An asset is creditor proofed when a creditor cannot legally obtain the debtor’s asset or its value for repayment.</li>
<li>Creditor-proofing should not be a standalone exercise or be the sole motivation for investment choice. An investment should first be chosen based on how it meets the full scope of client needs.

<ul>
<li>Suitability is a specific investment need that is very important to meet where the agent compares the features of an investment to the investor’s investment objectives, constraints, and risk profile.</li>
<li>The agent begins by seeking information from the investor about the purpose of the investment, expectations, wants, and needs. The investor must be clear about his objectives and concerns. The agent should never rely on old or outdated information.</li>
<li>The agent then applies his knowledge of the client’s objectives and limitations against investment characteristics and suggests recommendations to the investor wherein the investor may agree or disagree with the findings of the agent.</li>
<li>If agreement is reached, then the investor decides to proceed with the recommendation(s). If agreement is not reached, the agent must gain further understanding from the client about his reasons for rejecting the recommendation(s). The agent takes that information away and begins the research process again.</li>
<li>Suitability evolves from needs’ analysis and know your client. The sucess in assessing suitability results from collecting more information and better understanding the client's needs.</li>
<li>Suitability is established at the time an investment is made and it should be re-examined if there are significant changes in the life of the investor, such as retirement or if characteristics of the investment itself change.</li>

<li>When a person earns less net income than the annual minimum threshold, he will receive 100% of his OAS pension.</li>
<li>If he earns an amount between the minimum and the maximum threshold, he will find his OAS pension is reduced.</li>
<li>If he earns more than the maximum threshold, he forfeits the entire pension and receives no OAS.</li>

<li>When net income greater than the threshold falls between the minimum and maximum threshold, a lump-sum OAS repayment may be triggered and paid with the income tax return for the year. The repayment, or clawback, is presently 15% of the difference between net income and the threshold:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-1-1" name="__codelineno-1-1" href="#__codelineno-1-1"></a>Repayment = (net income - threshold) × 15%

<ul>
<li>An employer-provided retirement pension is in place to reward employees by paying a future pension income. It is commonly called a “company pension” or “private pension.”</li>
<li>Pension plans can take multiple forms and are funded by companies in both the public and private sector. These pensions are typically called “registered pension plans” (RPPs).</li>
<li>They include:<ul>
<li>Defined benefit pension plans (DBPPs);</li>
<li>Defined contribution pension plans (DCPPs);</li>
<li>Pooled registered pension plans (PRPPs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Savings in an RPP are a valuable asset for plan members. However, most Canadian workers are not members of an RPP. Therefore, they must personally fund future retirement costs by saving through other plans (such as an RRSP).</li>
<li>All public sector employees are provided with a retirement pension from their employers (i.e., doctors, medical personnel, teachers, members of the police, and emergency services, etc.).</li>
<li>Private sector employees may or may not be provided with an employer-provided retirement pension plan. Employees of firms that are federally regulated, such as bank employees, may be members of a pension plan that is registered federally.</li>
<li>The plan sponsor (most often the employer) registers and maintains the RPP.</li>
<li>A plan administrator is a person or third party that has ultimate responsibility for plan administration, such as enrolling new members, issuing pension statements and keeping records. He must also keep a detailed record if a plan member dies, retires, or terminates the plan.</li>
<li>Plan members receive a brochure or booklet explaining the terms of their plan when they join.</li>
<li>Vesting is a feature of RPPs that describes who owns the sponsor’s contributions to the employees’ plan when an employee leaves his employer. The employee’s savings always remain his savings; they belong to him. The question arises: What about the money the employer has contributed to the departing employee’s pension?<ul>
<li>The rules are determined by the pension benefits act of each jurisdiction in which the plan is registered. In the best case, vesting is immediate and the employee receives both his and his employer’s contributions when he leaves. Less favourably, vesting occurs when the employee is required to stay a certain length of time with the employer before he is entitled to both contributions. Least favourably is when vesting is not immediate and the employee retains his pension contributions but does not receive his employer’s contributions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pension plan contributions, whether made by the employee or the employer, and growth of those contributions due to investment returns are locked-in. Locked-in means that an employee cannot access the value of this RPP until he reaches the retirement age specified in the plan of which he is a member or satisfies the terms of the locked-in account to which he transfers his savings as a result of having changed employer. There are only a few, very specific circumstances, in which the funds can be unlocked.</li>
<li>Locking-in refers to the limitations put on the access to the money in an RPP. It applies to:<ul>
<li>Defined benefit pension plans (DBPPs);</li>
<li>Defined contribution pension plans (DCPPs);</li>
<li>Pooled registered pension plans (PRPPs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under particular circumstances, it is possible to unlock the total value of an RPP.<ul>
<li>These circumstances include cases of financial hardship, shortened life expectancy (usually defined as two years or less) and a very low account balance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are two phases to locked-in plans: a savings phase and an income phase.</li>
<li>Locked-in plans: the savings phase</li>
<li>An employee who is leaving a firm but is not retiring has several choices for his locked-in pension. During the savings phase he can:<ul>
<li>Leave the value of the pension in his former employer’s plan;</li>
<li>Transfer the pension value to the RPP of the new employer;</li>
<li>Transfer the pension value to a locked-in account at a financial institution;</li>
<li>Use the pension value to purchase a deferred life annuity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A person who transfers his pension value to a locked-in account at a financial institution will move his funds to a Locked-in RRSP (also called an LRSP) or locked-in retirement account (LIRA) based on where he resides.</li>
<li>The account owner makes the investment decisions for these accounts. The investment types available are the same as those in an RRSP.</li>
<li>The main advantages of the locked-in account are that it continues to add investment growth to the contributions in the account.<ul>
<li>Therefore, savings build, withdrawals are prevented, and tax continues to be deferred.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An employee who never changes employers or who leaves contributions with the employer after he has gone to work elsewhere still receives his DBPP pension during retirement. He has no need for transfer options or locked-in accounts.</li>
<li>However, an employee with a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) must transfer his contributions at retirement to a locked-in account.</li>
<li>RPP contributors cannot access their locked-in plans’ value before the specified retirement age. The plan is locked in to ensure that withdrawals are not made until the retirement age. If funds are not locked-in, withdrawals could be made, and the account value diminished before the beginning of retirement.</li>
<li><strong>Locked-in plans: the income phase</strong></li>
<li>The savings phase shifts into the income phase when the Locked-in RRSP or LIRA is converted to another form of locked-in plan that is structured to issue payments.</li>
<li>This must take place no later than the end of the year in which the plan owner turns 71.</li>
<li>Options available for the income phase of the RPP are established at a financial institution. They include the following:<ul>
<li>Life income fund (LIF);</li>
<li>Locked-in retirement income fund (LRIF);</li>
<li>Prescribed registered retirement income fund (PRRIF) for those whose plans are registered in Saskatchewan or Manitoba;</li>
<li>Restricted life income fund (RLIF) for those with a federally regulated pension.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A life annuity may also be acquired from a life insurer by moving funds from the Locked-in RRSP or LIRA.</li>
<li>An income stream is created because a minimum annual withdrawal must be taken from the LIF/LRIF/PRRIF/RLIF account and paid to the account owner.<ul>
<li>Withdrawals can commence at the retirement age set by the terms of the pension plan. There is a limit to the maximum annual withdrawal, except the PRRIF, which has no maximum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The life annuity pays a regular income to its annuitant.</li>
<li>An employee may end up with multiple pensions from multiple employers.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Roger, aged 58, had a defined contribution plan with his employer, in Regina, SK. It vested 14 years ago. Roger is laid off and decides to transfer his pension plan contributions to a LIRA, in which he can make the investment decisions. One year after being laid off, Roger accepts a new job. This employer provides a defined benefit plan pension. Roger joins the plan. On retirement, at age 67, Roger converts his LIRA to a PRRIF. He begins to make regular withdrawals from the PRRIF and receives a monthly pension cheque from his second employer.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Contributions to an RPP reduce the RRSP deduction limit for the subsequent year. This is called a “pension adjustment” (PA). The PA is reported to the employee on his T4 (Statement of Remuneration Paid) or T4A (Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity and Other Income).</li>

<li>The defined benefit pension plan (DBPP) makes a dependable contribution to retirement income needs. The DBPP pays an income on retirement that is known in advance, lasts for life, has a provision for the spouse when the employee dies and is often indexed to increases in the cost of living.</li>
<li>A DBPP member makes no investment decisions, and the plan sponsor selects the investments that will make the promised pension at retirement.</li>

</li>
<li>When a pension plan is created on a class basis, every employee in that particular class is entitled to join the plan after working the necessary amount of time to qualify for plan membership.</li>
<li>A full-time employee is entitled to join a plan after two years of continuous employment, called “service,” unless the terms of the plan authorize the employee to join earlier.</li>
<li>A part-time employee is entitled to join after 24 months of employment. He must meet one of two criteria (whichever is less):<ul>

<li>Contributory plan—employees and the employer contribute;</li>
<li>Non-contributory plan—only the employer contributes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The employer’s contribution to funding the pension plan is determined by an actuarial estimation of the amount required to pay for pensions in the future.</li>
<li>When a plan is contributory, an employee may be able to make additional voluntary contributions (AVC) that will generate a higher pension.<ul>
<li>These contributions are deposited into a separate account that is structured as a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP) in which the employee makes investment decisions.</li>
<li>These plans are referred to as “combination plans” or “hybrid plans.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An employee who is entitled to enrollment in his employer’s DBPP can contribute for both current service and past service. This occurs if a pension plan is initiated by a sponsor; it recognizes employment retroactively.</li>
<li>The maximum contribution limit per year is set at 1/9<sup>th</sup> of the sum available to make a payment to a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP). This amount is determined by the Income Tax Act.</li>

<li>By final average earnings:</li>
<li>Based on average earnings in the years leading up to retirement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By career average earnings:<ul>
<li>Based on average earnings during the entire period of plan membership.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A flat benefit:<ul>
<li>Based on a fixed-dollar amount for each year of plan membership.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The rate at which benefits accrue cannot be more than 2% of a plan member’s remuneration for the year to a maximum annual dollar amount.</li>
<li>Some plans help to protect the benefit from inflation by raising the benefit fully or partially in step with rises in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).</li>
<li>A member of a DBPP can elect to obtain the commuted value of his pension at retirement or when employment ends.<ul>
<li>The commuted value is a lump-sum payment representing the present value of the pension.</li>
<li>Commuted values are locked-in, and the sum must be transferred to another account that continues locking-in, such as a LIRA. When the employee receives the commuted value he becomes his own pension manager and through his choice of investments will try to create lifelong income for himself and his spouse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Benefits can be put at risk for DBPP members if the pension plan is underfunded and the plan sponsor fails to make its required contributions to the plan.</li>
<li>On the death of a DBPP member, his spouse will receive at least 60% of the pension. If there is no spouse, a beneficiary may receive a lump-sum payment representing a commuted value of the pension.</li>

<li>The amount paid as retirement income for a DCPP member is completely dependent on contributions and investment income that build up in the plan.</li>
<li>The employer makes no obligations to the amount of pension that will be received. Thus, the plan member is not aware of the income to anticipate during his retirement.</li>
<li>A DCPP member determines how to invest contributions. He receives a menu of investment choices and a default investment option.<ul>
<li>The default option is used when the member does not make another investment choice from the existing options.</li>

<ul>
<li>To contribute to a personal RRSP, an individual must:<ul>
<li>Contribute before reaching the maximum age limit of 71 years of age (determined on the December 31 of the year one turns 71);</li>
<li>Have earned income for the preceding year; and</li>
<li>Have filed an income tax return for the previous year in which business or employment income was declared.</li>
<li>Have contribution room available from a previous year because the account owner did not make his maximum contribution in that year. In this way, RRSP contribution room is carried forward to subsequent years, and is formally called the “carry-forward provision.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Sarah has been earning $40,000 per year in her job at a call centre for the last two years. She is able to save about $1,000 per year in her RRSP. She could contribute up to $7,200 per year based on her income ( $40,000 × 18%). The $6,200 difference ( $7,200 – $1,000) between her contribution and her contribution limit is not used. Thanks to the carry-forward provision of the RRSP, the difference accumulates and rolls over to be available in future years. In five years, based on her same income and level of annual contribution, Sarah will have $31,000 ( $6,200 × 5) in contribution room.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Contributions can be made to an RRSP during the entire year. The CRA sets a date, typically 60 days after December 31, as the final date for contributions of the past year.</li>
<li>The annual contribution limit is the lesser of:<ul>
<li>18% of earned income for the past year;</li>
<li>Maximum dollar limit set for the year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Income received from salaries and wages, employment bonuses, alimony, rental income, and business income is earned income. Income received from investments, or pension benefits is not included in earned income.</li>
<li>An individual’s annual contribution limit is reduced by:<ul>
<li>Pension adjustment: the amount contributed to an RPP or DPSP in the past year;</li>
<li>Spousal plan contribution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The plan owner could use the carry-forward contribution room, created by not making the maximum contribution in past years, on top of the sum that can be contributed to an RRSP annually.</li>
<li>A one-time over-contribution of $2,000 is also allowed. The over-contribution is not tax-deductible and will grow on a tax-deferred basis. If a plan owner contributes more than $2,000, a 1% penalty tax is applied monthly against the excess contribution.</li>
<li>When funds are transferred into an RRSP from a DPSP, GRRSP, or another RRSP, the transfer is not regarded as a contribution. DPSPs, GRRSPs, and RRSPs are all registered accounts and so money transferred between them has already been counted as a contribution and will not be counted again.</li>

<li>A spouse (husband, wife, or common-law partner) funds an spousal RRSP or common-law partner plan for the benefit of the other spouse.</li>
<li>The RRSP spousal plan is a way to split income for the couple during retirement between one spouse who has a higher marginal tax rate than the other and, therefore, reduce total income tax for the couple.</li>
<li>Contributions are made by one spouse to the other spouse’s plan. The amount that can be contributed is based on the contribution room of the contributor. This reduces his RRSP contribution room.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Julie has available contribution room of $9,600 this year for her RRSP. She sets up a spousal RRSP for her common-law partner, Tony. She deposits $2,500 to Tony’s spousal RRSP. Julie’s contribution to her own RRSP now cannot exceed $7,100 ( $9,600 – $2,500).</p>
<p>When they retire, Julie will be in a higher tax bracket than Tony because she has pension benefits and other private income. If she had not set up the plan for Tony, all her RRSP withdrawals would be taxed at her marginal tax rate as income. However, through the spousal plan, withdrawals from Tony’s plan will be taxed at his marginal tax rate, which is lower than Julie’s.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The amount of withdrawal (up to the amount contributed) will be added to the contributing spouse’s taxable income in the year of the withdrawal, if the spouse who has received funds into his RRSP from the other makes a withdrawal from the plan in the year the deposit is made or the two calendar years following that year.</li>
<li>Solely, the contributed portion of the withdrawal is attributed back to the donor spouse, not the growth portion, if the withdrawal is a combination of contributed money and growth on that money.</li>
<li>Having a spousal RRSP can prolong the tax benefit of contributions past age 71 if the recipient spouse is younger. Contributions can be made until the RRSP matures when the younger spouse reaches the end of the year in which he turns 71.</li>

<ul>
<li>Upon RRSP maturity (i.e., at the end of the year in which an RRSP account owner turns 71), the account owner must transfer the funds in the account to continue tax deferral.</li>
<li>Income-paying options, also called “maturity options”, include:</li>
<li>A registered retirement income fund (RRIF):<ul>
<li>Investments in the RRSP can be transferred "in kind" to the RRIF, in which case they are simply switched from the RRSP to RRIF without having to be sold. This would be true if the RRSP was invested in segregated funds, for instance. The segregated funds are transferred from the RRSP to the RRIF.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A term annuity to age 90 or a life annuity:<ul>
<li>The investments in the RRSP must be sold so the cash can be used to pay for the annuity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is not necessary to pick only one option.</li>
<li>Funds in the RRSP can be split across options, for instance, a RRIF and a life annuity. The plan owner may want some future flexibility in regard to income and this is satisfied by the RRIF. He uses the annuity to provide a guaranteed income stream for life.</li>

<h4 id="4715-death-of-rrsp-owner">4.7.1.5 Death of RRSP owner<a class="headerlink" href="#4715-death-of-rrsp-owner" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>An RRSP can name a qualified beneficiary, or a beneficiary (including the estate) to receive the account value when the RRSP owner dies.</li>
<li>A qualified beneficiary of an RRSP is the plan owner’s spouse or common-law partner, or a child or grandchild who is financially dependent because he is a minor or because he has physical or mental impairment. This choice of beneficiary continues the tax deferral of the account.</li>
<li>When a qualified beneficiary is named for the plan, the value of the RRSP at the time of death of the plan owner is transferred to the beneficiary and reported on the beneficiary’s tax return for that year. If the beneficiary is a spouse who then contributes the amount received to an RRSP, RRIF, PRPP, SPP, or qualifying annuity in the year it is received (or within 60 days thereafter), the spouse can claim a tax deduction to offset the income received.</li>
<li>A financially dependent disabled child has the same transfer options as the spouse (RRSP, PRPP, SPP, RRIF, annuity) plus an option to contribute to a registered disability savings plan (RDSP).</li>
<li>A financially dependent child who is not disabled has only the annuity option available for transfer-ring the funds. The annuity can provide for payments based on a period of not more than 18 years, minus the child's or grandchild's age at the time the annuity was purchased. The payments from the annuity must begin no later than one year after the annuity is purchased.</li>
<li>Beneficiaries are not restricted to spouses or children; anyone can be named a beneficiary of an RRSP. In this case, the account will be collapsed. The CRA considers that the deceased account owner received the fair market value (FMV) of all the property held in the RRSP at the time of death. The tax return for the deceased will include this amount and any other proceeds received from the plan in the year of death. Therefore, it is included in the income of the deceased and tax is paid by the estate.</li>

<ul>
<li>Registered retirement income funds (RRIFs) are a maturity option for RRSPs.</li>
<li>The RRIF account’s function is to pay retirement income (even though income can begin before retirement).</li>
<li>A RRIF is funded by transferring the value of an RRSP account and continues tax deferral on the RRSP account.</li>
<li>An individual with an RRIF account is responsible for making decisions regarding the type of account (managed or self-directed) he will have.</li>
<li>A RRIF has the same investment options available as an RRSP.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4721-rrif-withdrawals">4.7.2.1 RRIF withdrawals<a class="headerlink" href="#4721-rrif-withdrawals" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A RRIF account owner, who is called the annuitant, is necessary to make a minimum yearly withdrawal from his account.</li>
<li>There is no withholding tax on the minimum withdrawal, but it will be considered taxable income when his income tax return is filed for the year.</li>
<li>A withholding tax applies to any amount of withdrawal in excess of the minimum amount.</li>
<li>The minimum withdrawal amount is a percentage of the account that increases with age, as shown in Table 4.2.</li>
<li>The percentage charged is based on the age of the account owner on January 1 and the RRIF value.</li>
<li>Withdrawals can be based on the age of a younger spouse and will make the account last longer if the minimum is withdrawn because a smaller percentage of account value is taken.</li>
</ul>
<p>Table 4.2 Minimum yearly withdrawal from RRIF, pre-March 2020. After March 2020, minimum withdrawal reduced by 25%.
<img alt="picture 108" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dekingtt/statics/images/2022-01-07-05-699.png" />  </p>
<ul>
<li>Note that a measure taken during the coronavirus pandemic, in March 2020, was the reduction of the annual withdrawal requirements for RRIFs, as shown in the above table, by 25%. Though the reduction is indicated for 2020 only, it is possible that the reduction will remain in place past 2020.</li>
<li>Withdrawals are all taxed at an equal rate as income regardless of how the account has been invested and whether capital gains and losses, and dividends have been earned.</li>
<li>Thus, there is no tax advantage to investing in equities in an RRSP or RRIF.</li>
<li>The advantages of equities lie in their potential regarding:<ul>
<li>Stimulating higher rates of return; and</li>
<li>Increasing overall account growth and value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The minimum withdrawal does not need to be taken in cash. Just like an input to a RRIF from an RRSP can be made “in kind” so, too, can an “in kind” transfer be made out of the RRIF. In-kind means the RRIF account owner can take the investment and transfer it to a non-registered investment account or tax-free savings account (TFSA).</li>
<li>RRIF withdrawals do not have a maximum limit, providing the account owner with flexibility as well as the ability to meet unexpected expenses. It can also cause the account to be depleted at a faster rate than anticipated, and is therefore subject to longevity risk.</li>

<ul>
<li>Unlike an RRSP, a RRIF is oriented towards regular income payments. The person who receives those payments is the annuitant. When the annuitant dies, a successor annuitant of the account can receive those payments. The successor annuitant must be a spouse or common-law partner.</li>
<li>A successor annuitant has several choices for using the proceeds:<ul>
<li>He can replace the deceased as holder of the RRIF and continues to receive the payments made to the deceased; or</li>
<li>He can transfer the assets in-kind into his own RRIF and continue to receive the payments made to the deceased; or</li>
<li>He can roll the RRIF assets in-kind into his RRSP. Doing this does not affect the survivor’s contri-bution room. To prevent probate fees on the account value at death, a beneficiary should be named for the RRIF account. These do not apply in Québec.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are no tax consequences to the estate when there is a successor annuitant.</li>
<li>Alternatively, a spouse or common-law partner, plus a child or grandchild who is dependent because of a physical or mental impairment can be named as a qualifying beneficiary.</li>
<li>Just as anyone can be named a beneficiary of an RRSP, so too can any person be named benefi-ciary of a RRIF. A beneficiary will not have to pay income tax on any amount paid out of the RRIF if it has been included in the deceased annuitant’s income. If a beneficiary is not named, the value of the RRIF becomes part of the estate and subject to probate fees according the province in which the estate is based. The value of the RRIF is included as income on the RRIF-holder’s final tax return and taxed accordingly.</li>

<li>A tax-free savings account (TFSA) is a registered savings account that is tax-free.</li>
<li>Investment returns earned by deposits to the account (i.e., capital gains) and withdrawals are not taxable.</li>
<li>A TFSA can be used for any savings goal.</li>
<li>TFSAs can be opened by a person:<ul>
<li>Over 18-year-old; and</li>
<li>With a valid social insurance number.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A TFSA is a registered account. It is highly suitable for those whose withdrawals from registered savings have already been taxed, and who are seeking a means to avoid further taxation on their money. For example, a RRIF withdrawal is taxed. Its account owner may not need the entire withdrawal for living expenses. If the money is deposited to a non-TFSA and earns investment growth, the account owner will be taxed again on that growth. On the other hand, if the money is deposited to a TFSA, there will be no future tax.</li>

However, she can deposit it to a TFSA in an amount equal to her unused TFSA contribution room.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The TFSA account offers a broad range of investment options (such as GICs, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and segregated funds).</li>

<li>If an over-contribution is considered intentional—any investment gains on the excess are taxed at a rate of 100%.</li>

<h3 id="483-determination-of-risk-tolerance">4.8.3 Determination of risk tolerance<a class="headerlink" href="#483-determination-of-risk-tolerance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Risk tolerance measures the investor tolerance for taking risks to attain investment objectives. Fund investments plot five measures on the risk scale:<ul>
<li>low, medium-low, medium, medium-high, and high.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An investor will indicate which of those measures matches up with his personal risk tolerance or his agent will guide him to the correct match through a needs’ analysis.</li>
<li>Rating risk tolerance requires an agent to take time in client discussions to try and understand investor motivation, fears, and hopes to arrive at an accurate assessment and not rely only on an investor’s self-assessment.</li>
<li>Some indicators of risk tolerance are:<ul>
<li>Account and investment statements indicate investment experience, knowledge, and acceptance of volatility through existing investments;</li>
<li>Acceptance of risk is demonstrated in the analysis of personal risks;</li>
<li>Accounts in place and their level of funding demonstrate an approach to being risk-ready;</li>
<li>Age and circumstances indicate an ability to recover losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Alex believes that he can tolerate some risk in his investments, and when asked by his advisor, Morris, Alex states he has a medium-high risk tolerance. Alex’s interpretation of medium-high means he would accept up to an 8% loss in his invested capital. Morris’s interpretation of medium to high risk tolerance is up to a 15% loss in invested capital. If Morris proceeds to invest Alex’s money on this basis, Alex’s risk tolerance will be exceeded. Alex may result in taking on far more risk than he actually wants.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Lifestyle risks are not an indicator of financial risk tolerance.</li>
<li>Investors may have differing degrees of risk tolerance for differing investment objectives and time horizons. For example, saving for retirement might have a difference risk tolerance than saving for a holiday.</li>
<li>A longer the time horizon might have a higher the tolerance for risk because the more time available for investing the better the probability that invested money will grow and earn a positive return.</li>
<li>When time is short, the investor does not have the time to wait for a loss to turn around. Therefore, the risk tolerance is zero or very low.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Sally and Mark are saving for their retirement, which they now anticipate will happen in three years. When they retire they will be depending on their retirement savings in their RRSPs since neither has a private pension. It is essential that their savings are not diminished and, correspondingly, they do not want to incur investment losses. If they did, they would have to delay retirement because they would need to work longer to make up for those losses. Therefore, they have zero risk tolerance.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>• Investors are known to accept or even pursue risk, sometimes at a level unsuitable to their actual tolerance for losses, because higher risk investments may pay better returns than low risk investments. The potentially better return, earned as a higher percentage and/or tax advantage, entices the investor (who risks losing principal) to make the investment.</li>
<li>It is important to take risk capacity into consideration when assessing risk tolerance.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Paul is saving for his retirement in ten years. Achieving a better rate of return on his investments now could mean an earlier retirement date or more money available to him and his wife during retirement. He realizes that a low-risk investment right now will barely keep ahead of the rate of inflation, and he makes the decision to risk investing in a blue-chip Canadian equity fund, rated as medium risk. Therefore, Paul has medium risk tolerance. The fund’s historical rate of return over the preceding ten years is 9%. There is no guarantee that rate of return will continue, and Paul could suffer significant losses if the equity markets have a downturn. However, by holding his savings in a segregated fund he is protected against losses to a maximum of 25% of his investment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk capacity is a measure of how much the investor can afford to lose without impacting his objectives or lifestyle. It is an especially important consideration for investors who are approaching retirement or retired.</li>
<li>Those who cannot afford losses should restrict investing to the most safe, low risk, guaranteed investments.</li>
<li>An investor who can afford to lose principal because he still has earning power will be able to participate in investments with more risk if he has the risk tolerance to do so.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li>An investor may have the capacity for risk but he may not be risk tolerant. Tolerance and capacity are two risk factors that are measured separately from each other; one should not influence an assessment of the other.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Tim has significant assets: a home valued at $3.3 million, a generous pension based on his executive salary, an RRSP with a balance of over $800,000 and non-registered accounts valued at $2.7 million. Even though Tim has a high capacity for risk because, by any measure, he is a wealthy man, he has low risk tolerance. He invests in low-risk to medium-low risk investments, because he is not comfortable with the idea of losing any of his hard-earned savings.</p>

<h3 id="484-investor-profile-goal">4.8.4 Investor profile goal<a class="headerlink" href="#484-investor-profile-goal" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The agent should make recommendations to the client in line with the investor profile based on facts and requirements as a result of his analysis.</li>
<li>The agent shows his ability as an investment advisor by working through all the elements of the investor profile</li>
