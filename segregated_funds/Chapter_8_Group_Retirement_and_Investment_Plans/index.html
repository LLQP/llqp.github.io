<ul>
<li>This chapter examines the agent’s role in providing service to a client who is a group sponsor or administrator.</li>
<li>The agent works with the client to achieve the savings and investment objectives of the group the client represents.</li>
<li>The sponsor offering this type of plan is making a commitment to its group members.</li>
<li>There are financial obligations for the sponsor and administrative costs incurred when a group plan is offered.</li>
<li>To provide sound advice to a sponsor or administrator, the agent must be familiar with the following.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="81-group-plan-structure">8.1 Group Plan Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#81-group-plan-structure" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A group plan is comprised of its:<ul>
<li>Sponsor;</li>
<li>Administrator;</li>
<li>Members; and</li>
<li>Insurer</li>
<li>The agent must be aware of the rights and responsibilities of each.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="811-group-plan-sponsor">8.1.1 Group plan sponsor<a class="headerlink" href="#811-group-plan-sponsor" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The group plan sponsor (typically the employer) establishes and registers the group registered pension plan (RPP) with Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and provincial authorities.</li>
<li>The applicable provincial pension benefits legislation outlines the requirements for the group registered pension plan.<ul>
<li>This includes compliance with filing certain reports, the possible need for an auditor’s report, actuarial reports, and other reports as needed by the jurisdiction in which the group plan is registered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the other hand, some group pension plans are regulated on a federal level and are not subject to provincial legislation.</li>
<li>Federally regulated pension plans are provided to employees who work in an industry that is federally regulated (i.e., banking).</li>
<li>Group Retirement and Investment Plans</li>
<li>Registration with CRA guarantees that the yearly maximum RRSP contribution limit is not surpassed since registered pension plan (RPP) contributions reduce the amount that can be paid to an RRSP.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8111-role-of-plan-sponsor">8.1.1.1 Role of plan sponsor<a class="headerlink" href="#8111-role-of-plan-sponsor" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The sponsor’s role is to:<ul>
<li>Design the pension plan according to its needs, yet within the sponsor’s financial limitations;</li>
<li>Set the benefit structure for members;</li>
<li>Establish, amend, or terminate the plan;</li>
<li>Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for reporting;</li>
<li>Address funding shortfalls or surpluses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Final decisions about a group plan are the responsibility of the sponsor. However, the administrators and life insurance agent should guide the sponsor in his decisions.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8112-funding-commitment-by-plan-sponsor">8.1.1.2 Funding commitment by plan sponsor<a class="headerlink" href="#8112-funding-commitment-by-plan-sponsor" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A sponsor takes on the financial commitment to fund the group plan as:<ul>
<li>A joint contributor with the group members; or</li>
<li>Alone for the group members.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the sponsor and the group member both contribute to a plan, it is said to have contributory funding. Contributory plans include:<ul>
<li>Defined benefit pension plans (DBPPs);</li>
<li>Defined contribution pension plans (DCPPs);</li>
<li>Group registered retirement savings plans (GRRSPs); and</li>
<li>Pooled registered pension plan (PRPPs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the sponsor alone contributes to a plan, the plan is non-contributory:<ul>
<li>A deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP) is non-contributory;</li>
<li>Other plans may also be non-contributory if the sponsor does not require employee contributions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Group member contributions are made through payroll deduction when a plan is contributory. Thus, the contribution is made before take-home pay is received.</li>
<li>Contributory plans may be structured so that the sponsor offers a matching formula in which the sponsor bases its contribution on the amount of the contribution made by the group member.</li>
<li>The sponsor can match a dollar-for-dollar contribution or a different percentage.</li>
<li>The matching formula can be structured to:<ul>
<li>Increase over time:</li>
<li>The matching contribution increases the longer the employee works for the employer. This can decrease employee turnover, and employee loyalty is rewarded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reward employees based on their value to the sponsor:<ul>
<li>The matching contribution can vary for different categories of employees. Therefore, the most valuable employees are more highly rewarded for their service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create loyalty:<ul>
<li>The matching contribution may apply after an employee has worked through a defined waiting period. This helps to retain employees and discourage new hires from seeking other employment opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If matching contributions are not a condition of an employment contract or collective bargaining agreement, they can be altered or ended at any time</li>
<li>The plan’s vesting provisions also affect funding requirements for the sponsor. Vesting shows who owns the contributions of the sponsor to an employee's plan.</li>
<li>During the vesting period, an employee who changes jobs only retains the contributions he made to his group plan—not the sponsor contributions.</li>
<li>Nonetheless, when the vesting period ends, the sponsor contributions become the property of the employee.<ul>
<li>In some cases, vesting is immediate and the employee retains both his and his employer’s contributions when he leaves. Thus, a shorter vesting period is more expensive for the plan sponsor because his contributions could leave with the departing employee after the briefer period of time.</li>
<li>Vesting periods are determined by each jurisdiction. Typically, two years is considered average—but vesting may be immediate or as long as three years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Natalie begins her new job on September 1. Her employer plan, a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP), has a six-month waiting period. On March 1, her plan begins with a contribution made by Natalie, deducted from her payroll and a 100% matching contribution by her employer.</p>
<p>The plan has a one-year vesting period. If Natalie changes employers before the end of the vesting period, she will retain the contributions she made to the plan. Her employer’s contributions will be retained by the employer. However, if she leaves after one year, Natalie will retain both her contributions and those made by her employer.</p>
<p>Natalie may be able to transfer her pension plan savings to her new employer. A locked-in retirement account (LIRA) is another transfer option available to her. If she decides on transferring to a LIRA, she can be in charge of the savings and will have investment options of her choosing, instead of being restricted to the limited options of the group plan.</p>

<ul>
<li>The plan administrator is appointed by the group pension plan sponsor.</li>
<li>In Québec, group plans with more than 25 members must be administered by a pension committee.</li>
<li>Often, the sponsor is also the administrator.</li>
<li>When the employer is also the plan administrator, the employer must take into account the plan’s beneficiaries’ best interests.</li>
<li>The pension plan administrator has both a financial and administrative role. This role is performed by human resources, an accounting, or a third party.</li>
<li>When a third party is used, it is often a firm that specializes in employee benefits and services.</li>
<li>For a DCPP, the administrator may be the plan sponsor, a board of trustees, a financial institution (for a simplified pension plan) or a pension committee as defined by pension benefits standards legislation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8121-role-of-group-pension-plan-administrator">8.1.2.1 Role of group pension plan administrator<a class="headerlink" href="#8121-role-of-group-pension-plan-administrator" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The administrator is responsible for overall administration of the pension plan including:<ul>
<li>Management of the plan;</li>
<li>Establishing a written statement of investment policy;</li>
<li>Investing the fund assets in accordance with that policy;</li>
<li>Creating and distributing other plan documents; and</li>
<li>Acting in accordance with applicable legislation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The administrator’s primary task is to administer the plan in line with the Act that governs the plan and its regulations.</li>
<li>The administrator has a fiduciary duty to plan members:<ul>
<li>He must act truthfully, in good faith and the best interest of members, former members, and others in the plan;</li>
<li>The administrator must also use the care, attentiveness, and skill when dealing with another person’s property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The administrator:<ul>
<li>Ensures contributions are made by plan members;</li>
<li>Describes the benefits of the group pension plan to job applicants and reinforces those benefits to members of the group;</li>
<li>Enrolls new members and withdraws members who quit the company, or retire;</li>
<li>Provides information;</li>
<li>Initiates claims and processes withdrawals; and</li>
<li>Makes changes as required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The administrator is also responsible for:<ul>
<li>Measuring employee satisfaction with the plan;</li>
<li>Monitoring industry trends, governance guidelines, and legislative changes to keep the sponsor apprised of new developments;</li>
<li>Suggesting potential plan and investment recommendations;</li>
<li>Assisting with plan sponsor governance activities; and</li>

<ul>
<li>The agent receives the data regarding the group’s composition from the plan administrator to enable an application to be completed.<ul>
<li>This information is protected by privacy legislation and must be strictly guarded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The group plan administrator guarantees that all the required information is supplied to group members regarding the plan and their membership in the plan through the pension statement provided to them on a regular basis.</li>
<li>The pension statement details can include:<ul>
<li>Type of plan;</li>
<li>Amount deposited to the plan;</li>
<li>Accumulated earnings;</li>
<li>Account balance of the member;</li>
<li>Investment allocation;</li>
<li>Net return on the account for the period covered by the statement;</li>
<li>Current years of service;</li>
<li>Projected pension payable;</li>
<li>Normal retirement date;</li>
<li>Earliest retirement date at which an unreduced pension may be received; and</li>
<li>Beneficiary details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The statement also states that all projections are estimates based on information provided by the sponsor. The actual terms of the pension plan should also be outlined in official by-laws.</li>
<li>When a group plan member discontinues his participation in the group, the administrator must give him a written statement with information regarding:<ul>
<li>Details about the balance of funds (i.e., total funds available, in the member’s account);</li>

<ul>
<li>Group plans provide investment and retirement savings.</li>
<li>These retirement and investment plans are associated mainly with employers even though they are available to multiple types of groups.<ul>
<li>The employees are the group members.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A group plan for savings and investment, in particular to assist with retirement, is a valuable employment advantage. This is particularly true when the employer contributes to a plan on the employees’ behalf.</li>
<li>What are the benefits of the group pension plan?<ul>
<li>Employee pension savings grow faster and larger due to employer contributions;</li>
<li>The value of a plan can be received by a beneficiary in the event of death of the plan owner;</li>
<li>Payroll deductions—saving occurs by removing the contribution immediately from earnings and then issuing the balance as take-home pay; and</li>
<li>Creditor protection of savings, except when the account is a tax-free savings account (TFSA);</li>
<li>Tax benefits—group pension plan membership allows a group member to receive the pension income tax credit (at age 65 and older). This permits the pensioner to split pension income with his spouse, which in turn reduces income tax;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A group plan is customized to the needs, wishes, and financial circumstances of its sponsor.</li>
<li>The agent helps the sponsor to identify available options and create the plan that best meets objectives in the present and future.</li>
<li>When there is already a plan in place, the agent should examine it to determine if it is in line with objectives and needs. From this, the agent should make a recommendation that reflects present conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="821-existing-plan">8.2.1 Existing plan<a class="headerlink" href="#821-existing-plan" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An existing pension plan may become unsuitable for its sponsor.</li>
<li>It may not attract the talent the company seeks, especially if a competing firm has a better group plan on offer.</li>
<li>Instead of replacing a plan, there may also be good reasons to supplement one plan with another.<ul>
<li>For instance, providing a DCPP to all group members plus a DPSP that is based on company profitability for senior executives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The agent must evaluate and compare the existing plan against other similar plans to determine whether the plan’s benefits are still in line with the objectives of its sponsor and members.</li>
<li>Some principal factors of an existing plan that are analyzed are:<ul>
<li>Suitability of plan to sponsor objective;</li>
<li>Cost of plan to sponsor;</li>
<li>Investment options and their suitability for members;</li>
<li>Rate of member participation;</li>
<li>Compliance with regulatory requirements; and</li>
<li>Support to members by the plan provider, such as a website customized for the specific plan that makes it easy for members to monitor and change investments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="822-plans-available">8.2.2 Plans available<a class="headerlink" href="#822-plans-available" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pension plans are either:<ul>
<li>A single employer plan:<ul>
<li>A pension plan for a person who works for one employer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A multi-employer pension plan (MEPP).<ul>
<li>Covers employees who work for two or more employers not associated with one another.</li>
<li>Typically, a MEPP is found in unionized work environments, and contributions to a MEPP are made on a set contribution basis as stated in collective bargaining.</li>
<li>Note that MPP rules differ between jurisdictions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This chapter only covers single-employer pension plans.</li>
<li>Note: Agents should thoroughly familiarize themselves with the MEPP rules that apply in the jurisdiction where they work when there is a large unionized workforce.</li>
<li>Some group savings and investing plans are only obtainable through a sponsor (such as DBPPs).</li>
<li>Other plans are obtainable both through sponsors and to individuals who are not enrolled in group plans (such as TFSAs)</li>
<li>Group plans are in place to supplement, not as a replacement for personal savings.</li>
<li>Contributions to group plans may lessen RRSP contribution room. However, members should be encouraged to build savings outside their group plans for the future and take advantage of tax deferral on savings.</li>
<li>A sponsor may put in place a single group plan or multiple group plans.</li>
<li>For instance, a DCPP could be joined with a GRRSP or a DPSP to assist the employer to draw and keep top talent.</li>
<li>A group plan member is enrolled in an accumulation plan (CAP) when he is offered to choose from two or more investment options within the plan.<ul>
<li>DBPPs are not CAPs because the member does not have to make any investment choices.</li>
<li>DCPPs, PRPPs, GRRSPs, TFSAs, and DPSPs are all capital accumulation plans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guidelines outline the rights and responsibilities of the plan sponsor, service providers, and members when the plan is a CAP. These guidelines are standards in place to ensure that members of a CAP receive the information and support they need to make appropriate investment choices.</li>
<li>As discussed previously regarding their contribution to individual savings, these same plans must be considered from the sponsor’s point-of-view:<ul>
<li>Defined benefit pension plan (DBPP);</li>
<li>Defined contribution pension plan (DCPP);</li>
<li>Group registered retirement savings plan (GRRSP);</li>
<li>Deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP);</li>
<li>Group tax-free savings account (TFSA);</li>
<li>Pooled registered pension plan (PRPP);</li>
<li>Groups may also be offered a non-registered investment account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The following group plans convert registered savings into a pension income stream for group members:<ul>
<li>Group life income fund (LIF) for savings created in a DCPP;</li>
<li>Group registered retirement income fund (RRIF) for savings created in a GRRSP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A group member receives retirement income when the savings he has accumulated in his group plan are transitioned into a plan that pays a pension.</li>
<li>One exception to this is the DBPP in which the pension is paid by the plan directly.</li>
<li>Other plans may function similarly by accumulating savings. However, at retirement, many administrators entail their members to take the contributions’ value in a lump sum.</li>
<li>To receive a pension, those funds are transferred to a LIF or an annuity; both make payments and in this way, a personal pension is created.</li>
<li>There are other pension plans that an agent may come across such as an Individual Pension Plan (IPP) or a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). However, these plans are not covered in this manual.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8221-defined-benefit-pension-plan-dbpp">8.2.2.1 Defined benefit pension plan (DBPP)<a class="headerlink" href="#8221-defined-benefit-pension-plan-dbpp" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The defined benefit pension plan is a form of registered pension plan (RPP) that pays a known sum to its members at retirement.</li>
<li>The pension income is typically determined by:<ul>
<li>Employment income; and</li>
<li>Years of service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Contributions may be made by the sponsor alone (as noted previously, in a non-contributory plan) or by the sponsor and group plan member (a contributory plan).</li>
<li>The sponsor is fully responsible for ensuring that funding is adequate to provide the promised pension at retirement. If contributions are insufficient or investment performance has not met expectations, the sponsor must make additional contributions to cover the shortfall.</li>
<li>Sometimes, a sponsor is unable to meet its financial commitment to its pension plan. Such a plan is described as “underfunded.” If the sponsor is insolvent it cannot be forced to fully fund a plan. In such a case, the pensioner-members receive a pension less than promised.</li>
<li>A pension plan may also have a value (due to contributions and investment returns) with a greater value than its payment obligations. This is referred to as a “pension surplus.”<ul>
<li>Sponsors are discouraged from building surpluses, both by taxation of the surplus and because regulators or the courts can oblige a company to use a surplus to improve pension benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A defined benefit pension plan may be terminated by its sponsor or converted to a defined contribution pension plan (DCPP).</li>
<li>A “combination” or “hybrid pension plan” refers to when a DCPP is offered in addition to a DBPP. Members are required to make contributions to the combination place. They can choose to increase their pension by making voluntary contributions to their DCPP.</li>
<li>The group plan member has no investment choices to make when he is enrolled in a DBPP. All investment decisions are made by the sponsor and/or administrator.</li>
<li>Sponsor contributions are a tax-deductible expense and are not a taxable benefit to the plan member.</li>
<li>When income begins in retirement, it is paid as a life annuity for the member and his spouse, although the pension received by the spouse is typically a reduced amount. To match increases in the cost of living, a sponsor may choose to index payments. Indexing payments affects plan pricing for the sponsor.</li>
<li>DBPPs were once the most common form of pension plan. This is no longer the case because some employers have recognized the significant ongoing financial commitment to the corporation created by pension contributions. This expense has been exacerbated by lower pension fund returns coupled with increasing lifespans. The low returns in the funds and pension income that is paid for a longer period of time mean that sponsors are being required to make up shortfalls by special contributions between pension fund value and obligations. Many have taken advantage of their right to switch their DBPP to another form of pension that is less expensive, such as a DCPP.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Lifespans in Canada are on the rise, and this creates pressure on the sponsors of DBPPs who are committed to providing a pension for life for their plan members. For instance, the Ontario Teacher’s Pension Plan is a well-funded DBP that provides generous benefits to its members, teachers in Ontario. It reported that, in 1990, the plan had 13 pensioners aged 100 or more. In 2019, there were 135. In 1990, the Plan expected a pensioner to receive his pension for 25 years. In 2019, the expected years on pension were 32. This illustrates the increasing financial pressure on a plan as a result of longer lifespans.</p>

<h4 id="8222-defined-contribution-pension-plan-dcpp">8.2.2.2 Defined contribution pension plan (DCPP)<a class="headerlink" href="#8222-defined-contribution-pension-plan-dcpp" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A defined contribution pension plan is also called a money purchase plan (MPP).</li>
<li>A DCPP does not create the same financial burden on its sponsor as a DBPP because no set pension income is promised to members of a DCPP, so the sponsor is not responsible if a shortfall occurs.</li>
<li>The members’ pension is a result of:<ul>
<li>Amount of contributions made;</li>
<li>How long contributions are made;</li>
<li>Investment choice; and</li>
<li>Performance of selected investments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to their reduced financial obligation for the sponsor, DCPPs are gaining market share over DBPPs.</p>
<ul>
<li>More sponsors are choosing to introduce a DCPP over a DBPP.</li>
<li>Some DBPPs are being converted to DCPPs.</li>
<li>The role of the DCPP sponsor is to:</li>
<li>Set up a plan;</li>
<li>Make their specified contribution to the plan; and</li>
<li>Ensure continuing compliance with regulators.</li>
<li>The DCPP administrator is responsible for the following:</li>
<li>Educating all plan members about the plan’s details.</li>
<li>Providing members with investment information to make informed investment choices.</li>
<li>The DCPP plan outlines the sponsor’s minimum financial obligation, as a percentage of member income, for each plan member. There is no obligation to increase contributions over time.</li>
<li>Sponsors can structure a DCPP to:</li>
<li>Make participation optional;</li>
<li>Require members to increase contributions over time;</li>
<li>Restrict investment options available.</li>
<li>Sponsor contributions are a tax-deductible expense and are not a taxable benefit to the plan member.</li>
<li>The investments that will be made available to plan members are chosen by the sponsor or administrator. The sponsor or administrator may select the options for all members in particular circumstances. The investment options may include:</li>
<li>Segregated funds;</li>
<li>Mutual funds—such as target-date funds (a form of mutual fund that becomes increasingly conservative as the date on which the funds are needed draws closer); and</li>
<li>Guaranteed investment accounts.</li>
<li>A member who monitors and manages his investments on an active basis may find the DCPP very advantageous because he can:</li>
<li>Access available investment options;</li>
<li>Switch among investments according to his needs and investment performance; and</li>
<li>Tailor investment risk to his individual risk tolerance.</li>
<li>Note that some plan members may find the investment choices difficult to grasp, leading to delayed decisions or a failure to even make decisions. The onus for investing to achieve their retirement savings goal is ultimately up to the group member despite the assistance provided by the sponsor or administrator.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8223-group-life-income-fund-lif">8.2.2.3 Group life income fund (LIF)<a class="headerlink" href="#8223-group-life-income-fund-lif" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A group member with a DCPP is required to transfer his savings to an account that requires minimum withdrawals when he decides to receive his retirement income.</li>
<li>The group member’s choices are restricted because the group member’s savings are locked-in. This limits his choices to income-paying accounts that accept locked-in funds such as group life income funds (LIFs).</li>
<li>The LIF can be set up by:</li>
<li>A person who transfers their pension savings; or</li>
<li>The sponsor on a group basis—a group LIF allows continuity for the plan member and lower administration fees than LIFs chosen on an individual basis.</li>
<li>LIFs limit the maximum that can be withdrawn and require minimum yearly withdrawals.</li>
<li>LIFs are available in all provinces.</li>
<li>Provinces often refer to LIFs under different names;</li>
<li>The percentages for minimum and maximum withdrawals vary between provinces.</li>
<li>The sponsor can present the group LIF as:</li>
<li>An additional employment benefit;</li>
<li>A great benefit for employees intimidated by the possibility of going-it-alone when retirement arrives; and</li>

<ul>
<li>A group registered retirement savings plan is a savings plan in which contributions are made by sponsors and members.</li>
<li>A GRRSP is fundamentally the same as an individual RRSP.</li>
<li>Total yearly contributions to a group RRSP are restricted to the individual’s RRSP deduction limit for the year (as provided by Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) in the latest Notice of Assessment).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Reginald works as an assembler for an electronics manufacturer and earns $60,000 a year. He participates in the company’s GRRSP—both the employer and Reginald contribute 5% of his earnings to the plan.</p>
<p>Total contributions to the GRRSP are $6,000 ((60,000 × 5%) × 2). Since Reginald’s income was the same last year (i.e., $60,000) this year’s RRSP deduction limit is $10,800 ( $60,000 × 18%).</p>
<p>As Reginald’s contribution to the company GRRSP was $6,000 for the year, he can contribute up to $4,800 ( $10,800 – $6,000) to his personal RRSP.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>A GRRSP does not usually allow the purchase of individual securities (i.e., stocks).</li>
<li>GRRSPs have lower fees than an individual RRSP.</li>
<li>Contributions made by the individual and the sponsor to the GRRSP vest immediately.<ul>
<li>Since their contributions will have vested whenever an employee leaves and become the property of the employee, a GRRSP can be costly for sponsors who have a high rate of staff turnover.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The sponsor of a GRRSP incurs additional costs because their contributions are seen as additional salary paid to members. Payroll charges, such as Employment Insurance, are incurred on their contributions to the group plan.</li>
<li>No financial commitment is made by GRRSP sponsors regarding an eventual pension for members.</li>
<li>Members control their investments and contributions. They are ultimately responsible for creating their pension.</li>
<li>Contributions are made through payroll deduction, making saving typically easier for members.</li>
<li>Contributions made by the employer are taxable as income to the employee and are tax-deductible by the employer.</li>
<li>The GRRSP sponsor’s role is to collect and remit plan members’ contributions. The sponsor does not have any other additional commitments to the plan. For this reason, GRRSPs may appeal to organizations with restricted resources available for plan administration.</li>
<li>At plan maturity (i.e., the year in which the account owner turns 71 at the latest), savings accumulated in a GRRSP must be transferred into:<ul>
<li>A group or an individual RRIF; or</li>
<li>An annuity, to continue tax deferral.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8225-deferred-profit-sharing-plan-dpsp">8.2.2.5 Deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP)<a class="headerlink" href="#8225-deferred-profit-sharing-plan-dpsp" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>A deferred profit sharing plan is solely funded by employer contributions. Contributions to the plan arise from profits. Years with lower profits may see the company suspend contributions.</li>
<li>Consequently, a DPSP is most suitable for organizations with stable profitability to ensure that contributions to the group plan can be made on a continual basis.</li>
<li>Employer contributions and fees are tax deductible for the business and are not a taxable benefit to plan members.</li>
<li>On federal and provincial government plans, employer contributions are not subject to payroll taxes.</li>
<li>A tangible advantage of this plan is that contributions are tied to business profitability. Therefore, it can be used as a way to motivate employee performance.</li>
<li>Note that the following employees cannot be DPSP members:<ul>
<li>Employees who own 10% or more of the shares of the company; and</li>
<li>Employees related to the employer or a specified shareholder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Members can make partial withdrawals at any time. On the other hand, a plan sponsor can choose to limit withdrawals while the member is employed.</li>
<li>The members choose from the available investment options chosen by the sponsor. The sponsor does not commit to providing a future pension.</li>
<li>A DPSP is often used in combination with a GRRSP to which only members contribute. Employee contributions to the GRRSP are matched by employer contributions to the DPSP. DPSP contributions create a pension adjustment for members and thus reduce RRSP contribution room.</li>
<li>This is also possible with a DCPP.</li>
<li>The money saved in a DPSP can be transferred to a group or an individual RRIF, or an annuity, to continue tax deferral.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Mark, a life insurance agent, has set up a meeting with a technology company to review their group savings and investment plan. The company set up their group plan, a DCPP, a few years ago, believing that the plan provided a way for the company to attract some of the best talent in their business, video gaming, without creating financial pressure on the company.<br />
However, since that plan was implemented, the company has grown astronomically. It is enormously profitable and expects revenues and profitability to continue to grow. There is no problem hiring; the company is sought out by applicants due to the strength of its product line and commitment to ongoing development.<br />
The objective of the company is changing from using a group plan to attract employees to using a group plan to reward employees. Retirement income is not top of mind for employees right now since their average age is 36.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example  (Cont.)</p>
<p>Mark proposes a DPSP for the company. The DPSP can easily be funded from corporate profits and it aligns well with the philosophy of this younger workforce who strongly believe company profits should be shared with those who help create those profits. Mark illustrates the benefits of the DPSP in comparison to the DCPP and any disadvantages. If the company proceeds, it will continue to offer its DCPP plan since the DCPP continues to provide dependability in case the fortunes of the company change, and the DPSP will start once it has been properly registered and a contract issued to the sponsor.</p>

<ul>
<li>The sponsor may set up the group registered retirement income fund (RRIF) on behalf of the member to transition registered savings (in a GRRSP or DPSP) into pension income.</li>
<li>A group RRIF accepts transfers directly from the GRRSP or DPSP and offers its members the same features as RRIFs available to individuals.</li>
<li>There is no maximum to the amount a member may withdraw; however, the plan requires a minimum annual withdrawal.</li>
<li>The final date in which savings in the GRRSP or DPSP can be rolled into the RRIF is the end of the year when the plan member turns 71.</li>
<li>It is most appropriate to set up a RRIF when retirement income is needed. This is due to the obligatory annual minimum withdrawals, with the exception of the first year. However, an individual may set up a RRIF at any age.</li>
<li>Withdrawals from a RRIF are fully taxable as income</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The group tax-free savings account provides:<ul>
<li>No tax deductions on contributions;</li>
<li>No need for tax deferral;</li>
<li>No taxation on withdrawals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Like other group plans:<ul>
<li>Sponsors are not required to contribute; all contributions are considered income;</li>
<li>Sponsors are not responsible for providing a pension income to group members;</li>
<li>A choice of investments is available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The group TFSA restricts contributions in the same that individual TFSAs are restricted.</li>
<li>Each taxpayer is allotted an annual contribution limit (the dollar amount of contribution permitted for the year plus any unused contribution room from previous years). That sum is available for his group plan contribution, his individual plan contribution, or a combination of both. In other words, one limit for the total of all contributions. The annual limit cannot be exceeded without stiff penalties.</li>
<li>A significant TFSA advantage is that contribution room is independent of other plans.<ul>
<li>Thus, the maximum contribution can be made to a TFSA and an RRSP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Typically, members benefit from lower investment fees in the group plan compared to individual plans.</li>
<li>Contributions of the TFSA are not locked-in. Therefore, compared with other group plans, group plan members are provided with the flexibility to make tax-free withdrawals at any time.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Darleen is the owner of a small, prestigious real estate firm that serves a niche market in a wealthy suburb. Her employees, all real estate agents, are at either end of the usual working age: either they are in their mid-to-late 60s or their mid-to-late 20s. They all earn significant six-figure incomes every year and have enjoyed high earnings for the past number of years.<br />
Darleen’s financial success is a result of her agents’ success, and she wants a group plan that will recognize employees’ lengthy service without creating a significant tax burden for them. She knows that they have all made maximum RRSP contributions and have no available contribution room. They all pay tax at the highest marginal tax rate.
Darleen needs to retain her long-standing employees. She knows from experience that the younger ones are not particularly loyal, but the older employees are. None of them plan to retire in the foreseeable future.<br />
A group TFSA does not have a maximum age for contributions so, on this basis, is a good fit for Darleen’s older employees. Darleen creates a group TFSA for her more experienced employees on the basis of their years of service: those who have worked for ten years or more for Darleen are eligible to join.<br />
Darleen contributes the annual maximum to each employee’s plan and is quite happy to bear the cost of contributions plus additional payroll taxes. The agents can make withdrawals from the account, whenever they wish, on a tax-free basis. This approach is very tax efficient for the members of the group plan.  </p>

<li>Do not have employer-provided pension plans; or</li>
<li>Are self-employed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Licensed PRPP Administrators, who include some large life insurance companies, provide individuals access to the plan.</li>
<li>PRPPs are available on a federal level. They may be made available in all Canadian provinces—each province must enact its own PRPP legislation before the plan can be offered.<ul>
<li>Québec has adopted a matching plan, the voluntary retirement savings plan (VRSP).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The PRPP provides smaller companies with a pension plan for employees without the compliance obligations of other group plans.</li>
<li>Plan members benefit from:<ul>
<li>Lower administration costs (than with individual savings options); and</li>
<li>Portability—as members change jobs, the PRPP follows them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Employers and employees may both contribute to the plan; contribution limits are the same as individual RRSPs.</li>
<li>There is no commitment made for a future pension.</li>
<li>Contributions made by the employer are not included in the member’s income.</li>
<li>Contributions are not tax deductible for the member.</li>

<ul>
<li>Members of group plans pay lower investing fees in comparison to individual investors; this allows more of their savings to work as investments.</li>
<li>The plan sponsor selects the investment options available to group members. The group members choose from these available investment options.</li>
<li>The management expense ratio (MER) is less than what an individual would pay when the group investment is a segregated fund.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Ten years ago Janet’s contribution to her DCPP was $4,000 for the year. She invested in the most growth-oriented segregated fund she could identify. The fund earned 10% annually and, because it was offered through a group plan, the MER was just 1% per year (net return of 9%, i.e., 10% – 1% MER). After 10 years, Janet’s initial investment was worth $9,469.45 ( $4,000 × 1.0910).<br />
If Janet had made the same investment outside the group plan, the MER charged would have been 2% per year (net return of 8%, i.e., 10% – 2% MER). After 10 years, Janet’s initial investment would be worth $8,635.70 ( $4,000 × 1.0810).<br />
Therefore, in 10 years, Janet was able to increase the value of her initial investment by $833.75 ( $9,469.45 – $8,635.70) due to the lower management fees charged to the group.  </p>

<h4 id="8321-types-of-annuities-available">8.3.2.1 Types of annuities available<a class="headerlink" href="#8321-types-of-annuities-available" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Sponsors that offer DBPPs face substantial risk in funding their pension responsibilities in the future.<ul>
<li>With the help of actuaries, they must predict the amount of funds they should set aside in their pension fund for future pension payments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A way to mitigate that risk is for the sponsor to purchase annuities from an insurer in a “pension buy-in.”</li>
<li>How does the pension buy-in work?<ul>
<li>An insurer sells annuities to the pension plan sponsor that have guaranteed payout rates that match the sponsor’s pension obligation;</li>
<li>The insurer then becomes the provider of the pension benefit;</li>
<li>Therefore, the insurer assumes the risk of funding the future pension from the sponsor;</li>
<li>The benefits promised to retirees are unaltered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Companies who go out of business are still required to meet their pension obligations. Therefore, the pension buy-in can be useful for companies that wind up their pension plans because they go out of business. Their retired group members will still receive their pensions as expected from the insurer.</li>
<li>GRRSP members may be provided with an accumulation annuity for their savings—the annuity pays guaranteed interest for a set term or a date stated by the investor.</li>
<li>DBPP members have a life annuity option when their contribution ends at retirement.</li>
<li>GRRSP and DPSP members may select a term annuity or a life annuity.<ul>
<li>Life annuities may be available as a joint and last survivor annuity and offered with or without a guarantee period.</li>

<li>Group annuities have no flexibility for withdrawals, and they cannot be ended once payments initiate.</li>
<li>Pension payments are linked to the annuity rate at the time of purchase – since payments will not increase if interest rates rise, the annuities therefore carry interest rate risk and inflation risk.</li>

<li>The agent should consider:<ul>
<li>Member demographics;</li>
<li>Member skill level and expertise;</li>
<li>Member education;</li>
<li>Member loyalty to the employer (measured by employee turnover).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The agent needs to understand overall group goals when establishing a savings and investment plan as well as the factors motivating a group to change from an existing plan.</li>
<li>The agent has a disclosure commitment to his client, the sponsor.</li>
<li>The agent must notify the sponsor of the insurers that he places business with, predominantly the firm that is being recommended for the sponsor’s policy.<ul>
<li>In Québec, an agent who is bound by an exclusive contract with an insurer must disclose this fact to his sponsor-customer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The agent must notify the sponsor of any existing financing arrangements in place between the insurer and the agents. These arrangements can be viewed as a conflict of interest. Otherwise:<ul>
<li>The sponsor must be provided with the basic information regarding whether the agent is compensated by commission or a fee, and if a bonus or travel incentive exists;</li>
<li>Specific dollar amounts must be provided if the sponsor asks for such details;</li>
<li>The agent must also attain written approval from the sponsor if he receives an increase in compensation following the completion of the sale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The agent must be prepared with executive-level presentations of his recommendations that address:<ul>
<li>Plan specifications;</li>
<li>Plan and investment recommendations;</li>
<li>Pension credits and adjustments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The plan will specify when or under what conditions a group member is entitled to receive a full or partial pension. This has a direct bearing on the sponsor’s cost for the plan.</li>
<li>The DBPP may state a set age (i.e., 65) or a required number of years of employment (called service)—or a combination the two—that must be satisfied before the full pension can be paid.<ul>
<li>The generic formula of age plus service is called a qualifying factor. It is more commonly known by the actual number associated with a plan, such “the 85 factor.” Note that it does not have to be the number 85; at one time it was known as “the 90 factor.” It could just as easily be “the 75 factor.”</li>
<li>The employee adds together his age and qualifying years of employment. For example, an employee who is 55 and has 30 years of employment with the sponsor meets an 85 (55 + 30) factor. If his pension required the 85 factor to be satisfied in order to qualify for a full pension, then this employee could retire with a full pension at age 55.</li>
<li>A plan may also indicate a minimum age at which the full pension can be received.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A partial pension may be paid if the full factor cannot be satisfied—either because the employee does not have enough years of service or because he is too young.</li>
<li>The plan document will outline the conditions for paying the partial pension.</li>

<ul>
<li>Developing a recommendation requires the agent needs to comprehend the composition of the group in order to understand whose needs will be served and whether needs are short term or long term. For example, if the group is comprised of members for whom average member age is young, then a plan that provides retirement benefits alone may not be the best fit for that sponsor or its members.<ul>
<li>A GRRSP addresses retirement income but also provides benefits such as the Home Buyers’ Plan and the Lifelong Learning Plan (LLP).</li>
<li>A group TFSA permits withdrawals; this flexibility can be very attractive to those with short-term cash requirements.</li>
<li>A DPSP can have an immediate effect on employee morale and retention when employees receive deposits to their plan from their employer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the administrator and agent have reached their conclusions, the agent develops his recommendation for the most suitable type of plan and its investments with the group specialists at the insurer or insurers he represents.<ul>
<li>Group specialists are experts in group plan structure and delivery. They also keep informed of changes in legislation and compliance requirements.</li>

<ul>
<li>Pension credits are created in plans except in GRRSPs, PRPPs, and group TFSAs.</li>
<li>The pension credit is a measure of the value of the benefit the member earned during the calendar year.</li>
<li>The method an employer uses to calculate pension credits depends on the type of plan and its provisions.</li>
<li>Pension credits for DBPPs, DCPPs, and DPSPs are calculated to determine a member’s pension adjustment (PA) for the year.</li>
<li>The PA reduces the amount that a member can contribute to an RRSP or a PRPP in the following year.</li>
<li>Therefore, an RRSP or PRPP maximum contribution for a DBPP, DCPP, or DPSP member is:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a>Contribution based on previous year’s earned income (to annual maximum) -
<a id="__codelineno-0-2" name="__codelineno-0-2" href="#__codelineno-0-2"></a>pension adjustment = this year’s contribution limit
</code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Ahmad’s maximum contribution limit for his RRSP this year is 18% of his previous year’s earned income. His earned income for the previous year is $48,000, so his maximum RRSP contribution is $8,640 ( $48,000 × 18%). His pension adjustment for last year was $3,300 due to the contributions made to his DCPP at work. Therefore, he can contribute $5,340 ( $8,640 – $3,300) to his RRSP this year.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Contribution room to an RRSP and PRPP can be increased by a pension adjustment reversal (PAR). If too much has been taken as a pension adjustment (PA) in a year - for instance, due to the plan member retiring or being terminated during the year - then the PA is recalculated. The difference between the full and the reduced PA is the PAR.</li>
<li>A sponsor may increase benefits of a plan by retroactively increasing the benefit formula:<ul>
<li>This creates a past service pension adjustment (PSPA) for the member;</li>

<h4 id="8521-transfer-options">8.5.2.1 Transfer options<a class="headerlink" href="#8521-transfer-options" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>The sponsor follows the instructions of the plan member when he leaves the plan due to a change in employment or retirement.</li>
<li>Options available for transfer depend on the type of plan and whether the plan member wishes to continue savings or to begin receiving income.</li>
<li>Whether the income starts partly depends on age at the time of transfer, since withdrawals may not be possible before a specified age.</li>
<li>There are many conditions that must be carefully considered by the group member when a group plan-to-plan transfer is contemplated.</li>
<li>An agreement transfer between DBPPs allows a member of a DBPP, who quits one plan to transfer the commuted value of his pension rights into the pension plan of the new employer and be recognized for years of service under the new plan.</li>
<li>The terms of pension plans are not all the same.</li>
<li>The value of one plan may not be equivalent to another plan, and a shortfall can arise. If so, the employee can contribute the sum needed to make up the shortfall in a lump sum within a specified deadline or pro-rate the amount of transfer.</li>
<li>Plans may also differ as to when a pension is available. A group member would likely not want to transfer commuted value from one plan that permitted retirement on a full pension at age 62 to another plan, in which the full pension is provided at age 65.</li>
<li>The member of a DCPP may be offered an entirely different set of investment options if he transfers to another pension plan. Even if he finds the new range of options unsuitable, the transfer cannot be undone.</li>
<li>A transfer of accumulated funds to a locked-in retirement account (LIRA), or other self-administered plan, eliminates the problems associated with a group plan-to-plan switch.</li>
<li>The account owner must be prepared to make investment decisions, from the universe of choices as he “goes it alone.” For best results, he should be knowledgeable about the investments available to him and be prepared to monitor his account regularly. He takes on the responsibility of creating the equivalent of the pension income for himself and his spouse.</li>

<ul>
<li>Agents may initiate the process of implementing a group savings and investment plan by identifying potential sponsors, and meeting with them to illustrate the advantages of such a plan.</li>
<li>Throughout the entire group process of sales and service, the agent responds to the sponsor’s needs and is the point of contact and source of group information for the insurer while a quote is being developed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="861-review-plan-with-sponsor">8.6.1 Review plan with sponsor<a class="headerlink" href="#861-review-plan-with-sponsor" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The agent must seek regular input from the sponsor or administrator about the existing plan to retain and enhance the business relationship.</li>
<li>Reviewing a recommendation that has been made and not acted upon can be important in building group business.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8611-annual-review">8.6.1.1 Annual review<a class="headerlink" href="#8611-annual-review" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>An annual review gives the agent the opportunity to reinforce the value of the plan and learn of changes about the sponsor.</li>
<li>It is essential for the agent to stay informed of changes to group savings and investment products, and how those changes could affect the sponsor’s plan.</li>
<li>He should also maintain a high standard of knowledge about pension trends to discuss their impact with the sponsor.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8612-change-in-circumstances">8.6.1.2 Change in circumstances<a class="headerlink" href="#8612-change-in-circumstances" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Just as important as providing information to a sponsor or administrator is the agent’s service role in bringing information about a sponsor back to the insurer.</li>
<li>The insurer needs to know about changes to the composition of a workforce (both growth and shrinkage), financial circumstances of the sponsor, change in administrators, and other relevant details.</li>
<li>A sponsor may choose to wind up, or end its pension plan. This requires filing the necessary forms with the provincial pension regulator.<ul>
<li>The value of the pension plan is held in trust for its members and cannot be accessed by the sponsor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="87-claims-by-group-members">8.7 Claims by Group Members<a class="headerlink" href="#87-claims-by-group-members" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A claim from a group member is initiated to receive the funds in the plan.</li>
<li>To make a claim, a group member needs to provide the group name and certificate or identification number to the insurer.</li>
<li>The appropriate claim form must be completed by the group member to enable the claim to be processed.</li>
<li>If a group member dies, the spouse will be called upon for information to enable his claim to the pension proceeds.</li>

<ul>
<li>Contributions to some group plans are the basis for locked-in savings. Withdrawals cannot usually be made by the group member when savings are locked-in.</li>
<li>However, there are some exceptions to the locking-in rule that allow the savings to be accessed earlier than they would otherwise be available or in larger withdrawal amounts. They include when:<ul>
<li>Life expectancy of the contributor is shortened;</li>
<li>Financial hardship is proven;</li>
<li>The member is no longer a Canadian resident;</li>
<li>The balance of the account is less than a specified sum;</li>
<li>Funds are being transferred to a life income fund (LIF) or restricted life income fund (RLIF for federal pensions), and a partial withdrawal is available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Claims being made under any of these circumstances require that the necessary forms be completed by the group plan member.</li>
