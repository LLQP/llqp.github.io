<li>Personal income is the tax levied on the total income of individuals net of deductions and credits. It is based on an individual’s taxable income.</li>
<li>Taxable income includes:<ul>
<li>Salaries and wages;</li>
<li>Commissions;</li>
<li>Rental Income;</li>
<li>Net income from unincorporated businesses (for example, self-employment income);</li>

<li>Federal income taxes are based on “graduated” tax rates.</li>
<li>This means that the percentage of taxes paid increases as taxable income increases. Thus, an individual with a higher income will have a higher tax rate than an individual with a lower income.</li>
<li>Currently, the top federal tax rate is 29%.</li>
<li>Corporations pay either a 10.5% or 15% federal tax rate.</li>
<li>With the exception of Québec, which has a separate provincial tax return, the federal tax return for residents of the other provinces and territories includes provincial and territorial returns.</li>
<li>The main criteria for filing a return are:<ul>
<li>Does the individual owe unpaid taxes?</li>
<li>Is the individual required to contribute to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or the Québec Pension Plan (QPP)?</li>
<li>Does the individual have taxable capital gains?</li>

<p>Simon has a taxable income of $175,000.
According to the federal tax tables, Simon (a resident of a province other than Québec) will pay $31,114 on the first $150,473 ( $7,280 + $9,949 + $13,885). To determine the amount of additional tax he needs to pay, he calculates:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a>$175,000 – $150,473 = $24,527
</code></pre></div>
He multiplies $24,527 by 29% to determine the tax on his taxable income over $150,473 (that is $7,113). He then adds the amounts of $7,113 and $31,114 to determine his total federal tax of $38,227.</p>

<ul>
<li>Commodity taxes include:<ul>
<li>GST (goods and services tax), PST (provincial sales tax), and in provinces which combine the two, the HST (harmonized sales tax).<ul>
<li>HST is not charged on all purchases. Items as basic foods, prescription drugs, and insurance premiums are exempt from HST.</li>
<li>HST combines GST and PST, and only exists in some provinces.</li>
<li>In Québec, the Québec Sales Tax (QST) follows the same rules as GST. The QST is not harmonized and is a separate tax.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Excise tax are charged on such things as fuel-ineffcient vehiclies, air conditioners designed for use in automoblies and gasoline. They also include excise duties on alcohol and tobacco products.</li>
<li>Up-to-date information on GST, HST and PST can be found on the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While insurance premiums are exempt from HST, some provinces can charge a premium tax on of certain types of insurance including group insurance. These will be covered in chapter 3.</li>

<ul>
<li>When an employee earns a salary, the employer typically “withholds” a portion of taxes the employee would normally owe, and submits that amount to the government on behalf of the employee.</li>
<li>Withholding taxes also apply to items such as RRSP withdrawals:<ul>
<li>10% (5% for Québec*) on withdrawals $5,000 or less;</li>
<li>20% (10% for Québec*) on withdrawals from $5,001 to $15,000;</li>
<li>30% (15% for Québec*) on withdrawals greater than $15,000.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>*In Québec, there is an additional amount of 15% that will be withheld by financial institutions and insurance companies. This amount will be paid to Revenu Québec.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Jean-Marc, a resident of Québec, withdrew $20,000 from his RRSP. Based on the amount he withdrew from his RRSP, the 15% rate for Québec would apply, so the tax would withhold 15% of $20,000 = $3,000. Therefore, Jean-Marc will receive $20,000 - $3,000 = $17,000. According to Jean-Marc’s overall income, if the amount withheld is too high/low, any amount will be determined when he files his tax return that year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Individuals may be subject to foreign withholding tax if they receive dividends from shares of foreign corporations.</li>
<li>As a result of treaties, signatory countries waive or significantly reduce the withholding tax paid on income earned on assets held within registered savings or income plans (i.e., RRSPs, RRIFs). There is no mechanism for the refund of withholding taxes pertaining to dividends on foreign securities held in a tax-free savings account (TFSA).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Canada has a “self-assessed” tax system – Canadians report their own income and file their own taxes accordingly.<ul>
<li>A self-assessed system doesn’t mean that income tax payment is optional, but that individuals are the ones filling their tax returns, not the government</li>
<li>Any taxes owing are due by the tax return filing deadline date. As such, taxpayers should send payment for any taxes owing to Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) when filing their tax return.</li>
<li>Within a couple of weeks of filing, a notice of assessment is sent to the taxpayer confirming either an amount owing or a refund.</li>
<li>If there is a refund owing by the CRA, payment will be made either by cheque or a direct deposit to the tax payer’s account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) regularly audits or inspects a number of individual and corporate tax returns in order to verify legitimacy.<ul>
<li>Some audits or inspections are performed at random, others may be due to a suspicious or excessive claim.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The CRA can audit up to three years after the notice of assessment is sent (corporations other than Canadian-controlled private corporations and mutual fund trusts up to four years). No time limit for fraud and a blatant disregard of tax rules.</li>
<li>Individuals are required to retain all tax-related information for 6 years.<ul>
<li>For example, an individual who files taxes in 2015 should retain those records until at least 2021, in case he or she is audited in a subsequent year.</li>

<ul>
<li>Each year the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) audits or inspects a number of individual and corporate income tax returns, HST/GST returns as well as excise tax, duties and payroll records.</li>
<li>Most taxpayers earn salaries, wages or are pensioners. Their incomes are easily verified by comparing the information they file with the CRA with the information employers and financial institutions provide.</li>
<li>Taxpayers who are in compliance should not be concerned about such reviews.</li>
<li>The CRA will generally take more care to review individuals who have business or professional income, as well as corporations and trusts.</li>

<ul>
<li>If the CRA selects a return for an audit, an auditor will review the individual’s, corporation’s or trust’s return, information the CRA has on file, such as the taxpayer’s returns and financial statements and it may request specific records from the individual.</li>
<li>When the CRA completes the audit the auditor will issue a notice of assessment or reassessment if there are adjustments to the return.</li>
<li>If a taxpayer disagrees with the notice of a reassessment, they can try to resolve the issues that led to a reassessment at a CRA tax services office. If the taxpayer has no success at the tax services office level, a notice of objection can be prepared. This will lead to a review by the CRA’s Appeals office. Beyond that appeal may be made to the courts.</li>

<ul>
<li>The normal reassessment period for most taxpayers is three years after the CRA sends its notice of assessment. The exceptions are mutual fund trusts and corporations other than Canadian-controlled private corporations for which the normal assessment period is four years.</li>
<li>After this period, the CRA is barred from commencing an audit. Similarly, a taxpayer cannot ask to have a file reopened to claim a refund.</li>

<ul>
<li>GAAR is intended to prevent individuals and corporations from engaging in transactions that have no other purpose than to provide an inappropriate tax benefit.</li>
<li>The CRA definition of tax benefit under the Income Tax Act is: “a reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax or other amount payable under this Act or an increase in a refund of tax or other amount under this Act”.</li>
<li>The CRA discourages and prevents excessive tax avoidance through several strategies:<ul>
<li>Regular reviews for potential tax avoidance issues;</li>
<li>Monitoring current tax avoidance trends such as tax shelters; and</li>
<li>New legislation from the Department of Finance aimed at preventing tax evasion and excessive tax avoidance.</li>

<li>In Canada, taxes are based on residency. In the U.S., taxes are based on citizenship.<ul>
<li>All U.S. citizens, regardless of where they live and the source of the income, are required to file a U.S. tax return.</li>
<li>Many individuals live in one country but have income from another.</li>
<li>Others may have dual citizenship or income from both countries.</li>
<li>Tax treaties between Canada and U.S. reduce the possibility of double taxation on income earned.</li>
<li>Canadians who have worked or lived in the U.S. and continue to hold assets in the form of retirement savings may need to withdraw these funds. This is a complex process with possible options to transfer to RRSPs.</li>
<li>For example, Sam has lived and worked in Winnipeg for the past 20 years. He files his tax return every year before the tax filing deadline. Sam is also a U.S. citizen. Even though he has not worked in the U.S. for 20 years, he has to file a U.S. tax return to reporting the income earned in Canada. However, Sam can claim a tax credit on his U.S. tax return equivalent to income tax paid in Canada. The tax credit reduced the amount of U.S. income tax payable.</li>

<p>Margaret has taxable income of $80,000. The federal marginal tax rate for taxable income over $48,630, but not more than $97,069, is 20.5%. Margaret lives in Nova Scotia where the provincial marginal tax rate applicable on income between $59,180 and $93,000 is 16.67%. So her combined marginal tax rate is 20.5% + 16.67% or 37.17%.</p>

<li>Credits:<ul>
<li>Federal and provincial tax credits reduce federal and provincial taxes owing. In other words, tax credits reduce tax payable. For example, each taxpayer claims $13,229 (2020) as a personal amount, while people 65 years of age or older with income below $38,508 claim an additional age amount of $7,637 (this amount is adjusted downward according to income).

<li>Whether a will must go through probate depends on specifics and varies among provinces.</li>
<li>Probate fees (with the exception of Quebec) are administered based on the size of the estate – i.e., the fair market value (FMV) of the assets passing through the will.</li>
<li>Probate fees vary considerably by province.</li>
<li>Life insurance death benefits paid directly to a named beneficiary (i.e., the beneficiary is NOT the estate) are not subject to probate.</li>
<li>Québec does not require a notarial will to be probated. However, wills prepared by an attorney and witnessed must be probated.</li>

<ul>
<li>"Spouse" means a married spouse, a common-law partner or a partner, including a same-sex partner.</li>
<li>An exception to this is the “spousal rollover” provision that permits assets to be transferred to the surviving spouse at the adjusted cost base of the deceased and obtained at the same tax cost.</li>
<li>Under the spousal rollover provision, the deceased will not be taxed on the asset. Ownership will roll over to the surviving spouse. Only upon the death of the surviving spouse will the tax liability be assessed and become owing.</li>
<li>The adjusted cost base (ACB) refers to the cost of an asset for tax purposes. It is generally equal to the sum of the purchase price, plus expenses incurred to make the purchase, plus expenses incurred to sell the asset less the sum of any capital distribution received.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Louis died with an RRSP valued at $300,000. Under CRA rules, his RRSP can be transferred directly to an RRSP registered in the name of his wife Nancy with no tax consequences. Similarly, his stock portfolio can be transferred to her with no reporting of capital gains for Louis. In the case of the stock portfolio, Nancy’s adjusted cost base (ACB) is the deceased’s ACB, so any taxes on gains may be deferred until her death or until she actually disposes of the portfolio.</p>

<ul>
<li>The fair market value of an RRSP is generally included in the deceased’s income for the year of death.</li>
<li>However, if an amount is paid from the RRSP to a financially dependent child or grandchild, the amount reported on the deceased’s final return is reduced by that amount and a T4RSP slip is issued to the child or grandchild who then reports it as income.</li>
<li>Financial dependence would require the child or grandchild to have income less than the personal amount. If the beneficiary is a dependant of the deceased due to mental or physical infirmity, the RRSP proceeds may be rolled over, tax-free, into an RRSP or a registered disability savings plan (RDSP) in the beneficiary’s name up to his available RDSP contribution room.</li>
<li>Finally, a dependent child, or grandchild, under the age of 18 is entitled to a rollover of the RRSP refund of premiums to an annuity for which the child is the sole beneficiary. The annuity must be for a number of years not exceeding 18 minus the age of the child at the time of its acquisition.</li>

<ul>
<li>Employers deduct federal and provincial tax from each employee’s gross income and submit to CRA on behalf of the employee.<ul>
<li>The amount deducted is a credit against the employee’s taxes otherwise payable. If due to the impact of deductions and tax credits, the tax otherwise payable turns out to be less than the amount deducted the taxpayer will receive a refund when he or she files a tax return;</li>
<li>Employers also deduct Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or, in Québec, Québec Pension Plan (QPP), contributions and Employment Insurance (EI) premiums and, in Québec, Québec Parental Insurance Plan premiums. Deductions can also be made for employee contributions to an RRSP, registered pension plans (RPP), items such as retirement savings plan contributions, and taxable benefits including parking, cell phone and internet use;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Telework deductions in connection with COVID-19:<ul>
<li>An employee can deduct from employment income home office rent and the cost of supplies that were consumed directly in the performance of the duties (“Home Office Expenses”), if these outlays by the em-ployee were required by a contract of employment.</li>
<li>The principal condition for the deduction of expenses in respect of a work space at home, such as rent, util-ities and maintenance costs, is that the employee must principally perform (i.e. more than 50% of) his work from that work space for more than six months out of the year.</li>
<li>To claim a deduction for Home Office Expenses, the employee must file a Form T2200 with the employee’s personal tax return.</li>
<li>In the context of COVID-19, an employer may reimburse an employee for the purchase of personal comput-er equipment up to $500, and such reimbursement will not be a taxable benefit for the employee.</li>

<li>Prior to 2016, testamentary trusts were taxed federally using the same graduated tax rates as individuals. However, following a change, for 2016 and subsequent years, this is limited to 36 months for estates, after which it will be subject to the top marginal rate. Graduated tax rates continue for trusts whose beneficiaries are eligible for the Disability Tax Credit.</li>

<li>Inter vivos trust:<ul>
<li>Created during an individual’s lifetime, taxed at the highest MTR at a rate of 33%.</li>

<ul>
<li>Tax evasion is illegal. It can mean failing to report all income or making fictitious deductions.</li>
<li>It is perfectly legal to avoid or defer some taxes (tax avoidance) through proper financial planning, taking advantage of government programs or using strategies to minimize the tax burden.</li>
<li>Tax planning is an important part of financial planning to maximize tax reductions. TFSA, RRSP and RESP accounts are government-approved programs that provide tax-sheltered investment growth. The use of these programs would thus result in lower taxes.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 1</p>
<p>Juan wants to start saving for retirement. By using an RRSP, he lowers the amount of income tax he pays in the current year. His income within the plan grows tax deferred, and he only has to pay tax when he withdraws funds or receives payments from an RRIF or a registered annuity.</p>
<p>Individuals can contribute up to 18% of the previous year’s earned income to a maximum of $27,230 (for 2020). Last year Juan had a salary income of $75,000. This amount is Juan’s total earned income. His contribution room for this year is 18% of $75,000 or $13,500. He decides to open a plan and contributes $13,500. He will be able to deduct that amount from his income when he completes his tax return for the current year. This will reduce his taxable income by $13,500. Some investments are taxed more favourably than others. For example, an individual can invest in equities to enjoy the preferential tax treatment of capital gains.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example 2</p>
<p>Five years ago, Janine bought shares in a technology company for $10,000. The company has not paid dividends and the investment currently valued at $50,000. If Janine sells the shares now, she will pay tax on the taxable portion of her $40,000 capital gain, less transaction costs.</p>

<li>Taxes can be deferred through the choice of investments. The tax an individual pays on interest, capital gains and dividends from Canadian public companies are different and vary by marginal tax rate and by province. Interest income is taxed in the year earned or accrued. Capital gains, however, are taxable on disposition.</li>

<li>Life insurance agents should have a basic working level of taxation knowledge, but are NOT experts in all areas of taxation.</li>

<p>Alfred, Anthea, Roberto and Fatima are shareholders in a small advertising agency. Alfred is age 60, Anthea is age 40 while Roberto and Fatima are in their 30s. Their insurance agent recommends life insurance and disability insurance such that if one of the four should die or become disabled there will be funds available to buy out his or her interests. The agent has therefore brought accountants and a tax lawyer to advise, in the case of this agency, on whether the insurance should be owned by the corporation or by the individuals.</p>
