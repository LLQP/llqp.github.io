<ul>
<li>Employment income is the primary source of total income for most individuals. However, if an individual has invested money in investment funds, buys and sells shares or property, they may receive investment income.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="21-taxation-of-investment-income">2.1 Taxation of Investment Income<a class="headerlink" href="#21-taxation-of-investment-income" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Investment returns are taxed in different ways, depending on how the returns are generated:<ul>
<li>Interest – 100% inclusion (taxed the same as regular income);</li>
<li>Capital gains – 50% inclusion rates (only half the capital gain is taxed - this is called the taxable capital gain);</li>
<li>For example, if an individual has $1,000 in capital gains, only $500 is subject to taxation (at the individual’s MTR) and the other $500 is not;</li>
<li>Dividends – dividends from Canadian corporations enjoy preferential tax treatment via the dividend tax credit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If investment income is earned in a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP), a registered pension plan (RPP) or a deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP) all income is taxable including the capital invested as the capital invested reduces the taxpayer’s taxable income.</li>
<li>If the investment is in a registered education savings plan (RESP), only the growth in the plan is fully taxable when the funds are withdrawn. This is because when the investment was made it would have been with after-tax dollars.</li>
<li>Note that with registered plans the taxation of the income earned on the investment (the growth) is tax deferred until such time that it is withdrawn. Thus, the income does not have to be declared until it is withdrawn.</li>
<li>Agents need to understand how investment income is taxed because it will help them develop insurance and investment strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="211-accrued-interest">2.1.1 Accrued interest<a class="headerlink" href="#211-accrued-interest" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Interest income is fully taxable in the year that it is received.</li>
<li>Some investments do not pay out the interest income annually but instead, let it accrue until maturity. Even though the interest income is not paid out, it is taxable annually, as though it had been paid, and must be reported.</li>
<li>This is true for investments in all accounts except registered accounts, for which the taxation of income is tax-deferred until it is withdrawn. At such time, the income plus the principal invested is fully taxable.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Madeleine bought a $5,000 three-year Canada Savings Bond that compounds interest rather than paying it annually. She received a tax slip for the $50.15 in interest the bond accrued last year. She must report this amount even though she did not receive it. She will not pay tax on that amount when it is paid to her at the bond’s maturity. This way, there will not be any double taxation.</p>

<h3 id="212-dividend-income-from-canadian-corporations">2.1.2 Dividend income from Canadian corporations<a class="headerlink" href="#212-dividend-income-from-canadian-corporations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Dividend income from Canadian corporations is taxed at a lower rate than interest income. In other words, they get a preferential tax treatment.</li>
<li>Dividends are paid out to shareholders from the after-tax profits of a corporation. The amount paid to the shareholder has already been taxed in the hands of the corporation.</li>
<li>The shareholder then needs to pay tax on the dividend. This leads to a situation of double taxation because the government has already collected corporate taxes on the amount.</li>
<li>To mitigate this situation the government requires the taxpayer to report the gross-up amount of the dividend received. This is the taxable amount and reflects the amount of pre-tax income the corporation is presumed to have earned.</li>
<li>The amount of the gross-up depends on whether the dividend is an eligible dividend, those received from public companies, or a non-eligible dividend, those received from private corporations.</li>
<li>Eligible dividends such as those paid by public companies are “grossed-up” by a higher amount (38%) than non-eligible dividends (sometimes called ordinary dividends) (15%).</li>
<li>The taxable amount however is reduced by a federal dividend tax credit for eligible dividends (15.0198%) or ordinary dividends (9.0301%). The provinces each have varying dividend tax credits.</li>
<li>Similar provincial tax credits are available for both eligible and non-eligible tax credits. The rates vary depending on the province.</li>
<li>A dividend paid by a Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) from its small business deduction (SBD) income or investment income is an ordinary dividend and its treatment is slightly different.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Douglas received a T5 tax statement from the company whose shares he owned, indicating:</p>
<ul>
<li>The actual dividends received were $7,870.00;</li>
<li>The taxable dividends were $10,860.60;</li>

<p>Douglas wanted to confirm that the dividends are in fact eligible dividends. To do so, he multiplied $7,870 by 138% and got $10,860.60. He multiplied that by 15.0198% and got $1,631.24.</p>
<p>Douglas’s federal marginal tax rate is 22%. He calculates that he will pay $2,389.33 in tax on the “grossed-up” taxable dividend, which when reduced by the $1,631.24 dividend tax credit will amount to $758.09. As a result, he will have $7,111.91 after tax.</p>

<ul>
<li>A capital gain occurs when an investor (individual or corporation) sells “capital property” at a price higher than its adjusted cost base (ACB), resulting in a capital gain for tax purposes.</li>
<li>A sale of a capital property may also result in a capital loss if the property is sold for a value less than its ACB.</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, 50% of capital gains are taxable (i.e., capital gains have a 50% “inclusion rate”).
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a>Taxable capital gain = 50% × (proceeds of disposition - ACB)
</code></pre></div></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, if an investor purchases shares in a corporation for $5,000 and later sells those shares for $8,000, then the investor has a $3,000 capital gain and a taxable capital gain of only $1,500. If the investor was in a 30% MTR, the taxes owing on the $3,000 capital gain would be $450 (30% of the taxable capital gain of $1,500).</p>
</li>
<li>Capital property is any property held outside of a registered account which the taxpayer invests with the view of making income. Capital property includes cottages, rental properties, building and equipment used in a business, stocks and bonds, mutual funds, segregated funds, etc., held outside a tax deferral account.</li>
<li>Please note that a capital gain is triggered by a sale of the capital property. While the capital property is being held by the owner, no capital gain is triggered although the capital property might be appreciating in value.</li>
<li>Accrued capital gains are not taxed annually. Only realized capital gain on the disposition of a capital property is subject to tax. Hence, investment in capital property may provide a means of tax deferral to an investor.</li>
<li>A capital property need not be sold, to trigger a capital gains tax. A deemed sale occurs if an individual exchanges one property for another; gifts a property; if the property is stolen or destroyed; a person emigrates from Canada; and upon the death of the property owner.
<strong>Personal property</strong></li>
<li>The disposition of personal property does not trigger a capital gain or loss.</li>
<li>Personal property is a property owned by a person and used for his or her sole pleasure without intention of making any income on the property such as a boat or an automobile; household furniture; clothing; etc.</li>
<li>The CRA assumes that each of these properties has an ACB of $1,000 and holds that most personal property depreciates over time.</li>
</ul>

<div class="admonition example">

<ul>
<li>Allowable capital losses must be applied against taxable capital gains for the current year to offset all or part of the gain. If loss still remains, it becomes the taxpayer’s net capital loss, which is the difference between the allowable capital loss and taxable capital gain for that year.</li>
<li>A taxpayer can carry back the net capital loss to reduce or eliminate capital gains in any of the three immediately prior tax years or carry the loss forward into a future year.</li>
<li>When carrying forward net capital losses from previous years to be used in a current year, the taxpayer needs to be cautious of the fact that the capital gains inclusion rate may have changed and thus would need to make an adjustment.</li>
<li>In the Notice of Assessment, CRA provides the adjusted net capital losses that are carried forward and which may be applied against capital gains in the current year. When carrying back net capital losses, no adjustments are needed.</li>
<li>At death, capital losses may be applied against all sources of income of the deceased and not just to capital gains.</li>

<ul>
<li>Active investors in the stock markets regularly review their trades for the year and toward the end of the year they sell off some of their investments that are trading below their cost so they can use the losses to offset capital gains earned during the year, thereby reducing their taxes.</li>
<li>In some cases, the investor may want to buy back the investments that were sold at a loss.</li>
<li>If the investor buys back the investments that they sold for a loss immediately, the loss from the disposition will be deemed a superficial loss, and the investor will not be able to use the loss to offset capital gains for that year.</li>
<li>A “superficial loss” occurs when an investor sells capital property at a loss, and:<ul>
<li>The investor (or a person affiliated to the investor) buys or has the right to buy, the same or identical property (called substituted property) within a 61-day time frame – from 30 days before the sale to 30 days after the sale; and</li>
<li>The investor still owns or has a right to buy, the substituted property 30 days after the sale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the investor is the individual acquiring the substituted property, the investor can usually add the superficial loss amount to the ACB of the substituted property, thus, either reducing capital gains or increasing the capital loss when the substituted property is sold.</li>

<h3 id="217-tax-deferral">2.1.7 Tax deferral<a class="headerlink" href="#217-tax-deferral" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Because of the time-value of money, it is quite often efficient to defer taxation as much as possible.</li>
<li>A good example of this is the use of RRSP. Unlike accrued interest (which is taxed annually), increases or declines in the value of an investment, known a “paper” or “unrealized” gains and losses are not reported for tax purposes until the year in which the asset is actually sold or “deemed” sold; at the time of sale there is a “realized” or “actual” gain or loss.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition example">

<ul>
<li>Prior to December 31, 1971, capital gains were not taxed in Canada. This changed after 1971. An ACB for publicly traded shares was established using the fair market value as on December 22, 1971, and for other assets the ACB was the fair market value as on December 31, 1971. However, a principal residence would remain exempt from taxation.</li>
<li>At that time, the principal residence exemption was given on a per individual basis. This meant that couples could own two principal residences and utilize the exemption, provided they were not jointly owned.</li>
<li>This ended in 1982 when the rules changed to one principal residence at a time per family unit.</li>
<li>As a result of the change, a couple could now only own one principal residence. Couples were advised to determine the fair market value of the homes as on December 31, 1981, to have a base against which to measure future gains.</li>
<li>The rules changed again in 1994 when the federal government eliminated the lifetime capital gains exemption (LCGE) of $100,000. Many individuals with second residences applied any unused exemption to their second residences to raise the ACB.</li>
<li>From an insurance perspective, many families who own a second residence and want to pass it on to their children and/or grandchildren use life insurance to pay the tax on taxable capital gains at death.</li>

<li>The ITA also states that a corporation owned by a person will be related to another person including a corporation, in which the person has a controlling interest. Hence, a corporation will be related to a person if that:<ul>
<li>Person controls the corporation;</li>
